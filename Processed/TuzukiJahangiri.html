<p class="par first">Mr. Rogers translated the Memoirs of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r several years ago from the edition which Sayyid
Ah&#803;mad printed at Ghazipur in 1863 and at Allyghur in 1864.
Orientalists are greatly indebted to the Sayyid for his disinterested
labours, but his text seems to have been made from a single and
defective MS. and is often incorrect, especially in the case of proper
names. I have collated it with the excellent MSS. in the India Office
and the British Museum, and have thus been able to make numerous
corrections. I have also consulted the MS. in the Library of the
R.A.S., but it is not a good one. I have, with Mr. Rogers&rsquo;s
permission, revised the translation, and I have added many notes.</p>
<p class="par">There is an account of the Memoirs in the sixth volume
of Elliot &amp; Dowson&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of India,&rdquo; and
there the subject of the various recensions is discussed. There is also
a valuable note by Dr. Rieu in his &ldquo;Catalogue of Persian
MSS.,&rdquo; i, 253. It is there pointed out that there is a manuscript
translation of the first nine years of the Memoirs by William Erskine
in the British Museum. I have consulted this translation and found it
helpful. The MS. is numbered Add. 26,611. The translation is, of
course, excellent, and it was made from a good MS.</p>
<p class="par">A translation of what Dr. Rieu calls the garbled Memoirs
of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r was made by Major David Price and published by
the Oriental Translation Committee of the Royal Asiatic Society in
1829. The author of this work is unknown, and its history is an
unsolved problem. It is occasionally fuller than the genuine Memoirs,
and it contains some picturesque touches, such as the account
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e213" href="#xd24e213" name=
"xd24e213">viii</a>]</span>of Akbar&rsquo;s deathbed. But it is certain
that it is, in part at least, a fabrication, and that it contains
statements which Jah&#257;ng&#299;r could never have made. Compare, for
instance, the account of the death of Sohr&#257;b, the son of
M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam, near the end of Price&rsquo;s translation, pp.
138&ndash;9, with that given in the genuine Memoirs in the narrative of
the fifteenth year of the reign, p. 293, and also in the
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, p. 139. Besides being inaccurate, the garbled or
spurious Memoirs are much shorter than the genuine work, and do not go
beyond the fifteenth year. Price&rsquo;s translation, too, was made
from a single and badly written MS.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e215src"
href="#xd24e215" name="xd24e215src">1</a> which is now in the R.A.S.
library. Dr. Rieu remarks that it is to be regretted that so poor a
fabrication as the garbled Memoirs should have been given to the world
as a genuine production of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r. This being so, it is
appropriate that the present translation of the genuine Memoirs should
be published by the Royal Asiatic Society.</p>
<p class="par">When Jah&#257;ng&#299;r had written his Memoirs for the
first twelve years of his reign he made them into a volume, and had a
number of copies made and distributed (Elliot, vi, 360). The first of
these he gave to S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n, who was then in high
favour. The present publication is a translation of the first volume of
the Memoirs, but the translation of the whole Memoirs, together with
the additions of Mu&#703;tamad K&#863;h&#257;n and Muh&#803;ammad
H&#257;d&#299;, has been completed, and it is to be hoped that its
publication will follow in due course.</p>
<p class="par">Jah&#257;ng&#299;r reigned for twenty-two years, but
ill-health and sorrow made him give up the writing of his Memoirs in
the seventeenth year of his reign (see Elliot, vi, 280). He then
entrusted the task to Mu&#703;tamad K&#863;h&#257;n, the author
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e222" href="#xd24e222" name=
"xd24e222">ix</a>]</span>of the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, who continued the
Memoirs to the beginning of the nineteenth year. He then dropped
writing the Memoirs in the name of the emperor, but he continued the
narrative of the reign, to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s death, in his own
work, the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma. Muh&#803;ammad H&#257;d&#299;
afterwards continued the Memoirs down to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s
death, but his work is little more than an abridgment of the
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma. Sayyid Ah&#803;mad&rsquo;s edition contains the
continuations of the Memoirs by Mu&#703;tamad and Muh&#803;ammad
H&#257;d&#299;, and also Muh&#803;ammad H&#257;d&#299;&rsquo;s preface
and introduction. But this preface and introduction have not been
translated by Mr. Rogers, and I do not think that a translation is
necessary. Muh&#803;ammad H&#257;d&#299; is a late writer (see Elliot,
vi, 392), his date being the first quarter of the eighteenth century,
and his introduction seems to be almost wholly derived from the
Ma&#702;&#257;s&#804;ir-i-Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; of K&#257;mg&#257;r
H&#803;usain&#299; (Elliot, vi, 257). It consists mainly of an account
of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s life from his birth up to his
accession.</p>
<p class="par">It is perhaps unnecessary to say anything about the
importance of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s Memoirs. They give a lively
picture of India in the early decades of the seventeenth century, and
are a valuable supplement to the Akbar-n&#257;ma. I may be allowed,
however, to end this preface with the following remarks which I
contributed to the <i>Indian Magazine</i> for May, 1907:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Royal authors of the East had more blood in
them than those kings whose works have been catalogued by Horace
Walpole. To find a parallel to them we must go back to Julius
C&aelig;sar, and even then the advantage is not upon the side of
Europe. After all, the commentaries of the famous Roman are a little
disappointing, and certainly the Memoirs of B&#257;bar and
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r are far more human and fuller of matter than the
story of the Gallic Wars. All Muhammadans have a fancy for writing
chronicles and autobiographies, and several Muhammadan <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e231" href="#xd24e231" name=
"xd24e231">x</a>]</span>kings have yielded to the common impulse.
Central Asia has given us the Memoirs of Tamarlane, B&#257;bar, and
H&#803;aidar, and the chronicle of Abu-l-ghazi; Persia has given us the
Memoirs of Shah Tahmasp, and India the Memoirs of the Princess Gulbadan
and Jah&#257;ng&#299;r. In modern times we see the same impulse at
work, for we have the biography of the late Ameer of Afghanistan and
the diary of the Shah of Persia.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The contributions to literature by Royal authors
which come to us from the East form a department by themselves, and one
which is of great value. Nearly all Eastern histories are disfigured by
adulation. Even when the author has had no special reason for flattery
and for suppression of truth, he has been dazzled by the greatness of
his subject, and gives us a picture which no more reveals the real king
than does a telescope the real constitution of the Morning Star. But
when Eastern monarchs give us chronicles, the case is different. They
have no occasion for fear or favour, and mercilessly expose the
failings of their contemporaries. Not that they are to be trusted any
more than other Orientals when speaking of themselves. B&#257;bar has
suppressed the story of his vassalage to Shah Isma&#703;&#299;l, of his
defeat at Ghajdaw&#257;n, and his treatment of &#703;&#256;lam Lodi;
and Jah&#257;ng&#299;r has glossed over his rebellion against his
father, and the circumstances of Sh&#299;r-&#257;fgan&rsquo;s death.
But when they have to speak of others&mdash;whether kings or
nobles&mdash;they give us the whole truth, and perhaps a little more.
An amiable Princess like Gulbadan Begam may veil the faults and
weaknesses of her brothers Hum&#257;y&#363;n and Hind&#257;l; but
B&#257;bar strips the gilt off nearly every one whom he mentions, and
spares no one&mdash;not even his own father.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Memoirs of B&#257;bar, H&#803;aidar, and
Gulbadan have been translated into English, and those of T&#804;ahmasp
have been translated into German; but unfortunately
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e237"
href="#xd24e237" name="xd24e237">xi</a>]</span>have never been fully
translated,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e239src" href="#xd24e239" name=
"xd24e239src">2</a> though there are extracts in Elliot &amp;
Dowson&rsquo;s History, and Major Price many years ago gave us from an
imperfect manuscript a garbled account of a few years of his Memoirs.
Yet in reality Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s Memoirs are not inferior in
interest to those of B&#257;bar. Indeed, we may go further and say
there is twice as much matter in them as in B&#257;bar&rsquo;s Memoirs,
and that they are by far the most entertaining of the two works. Not
that Jah&#257;ng&#299;r was by any means as remarkable a man as his
great-grandfather. He was a most faulty human being, and his own
account of himself often excites our disgust and contempt. But he had
the sense not to confine his narrative to an account of himself, and he
has given us a picture of his father, the great Akbar, which is a
bigger &lsquo;plum&rsquo; than anything in B&#257;bar&rsquo;s Memoirs.
But his account of himself has also its charm, for it reveals the real
man, and so he lives for us in his Memoirs just as James VI&mdash;to
whom, and to the Emperor Claudius, he bears a strange and even
ludicrous resemblance&mdash;lives in the &lsquo;Fortunes of
Nigel&rsquo; or Claudius in Suetonius and Tacitus. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
was indeed a strange mixture. The man who could stand by and see men
flayed alive, and who, as he himself tells us, put one man to death and
had two others hamstrung because they showed themselves inopportunely
and frightened away his game, could yet be a lover of justice and could
spend his Thursday evenings in holding high converse. He could quote
F&#299;rd&#363;si&rsquo;s verse against cruelty to animals&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Ah! spare yon emmet, rich in hoarded
grain&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">He lives with pleasure, and he dies with
pain&rsquo;;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">and be soft-hearted enough to wish that his father
were alive to share with him the delicious mangoes of India. He could
procure the murder of Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l and avow <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e250" href="#xd24e250" name=
"xd24e250">xii</a>]</span>the fact without remorse, and also pity the
royal elephants because they shivered in winter when they sprinkled
themselves with cold water. &lsquo;I observed this,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;and so I ordered that the water should be heated to the
temperature of luke-warm milk.&rsquo; And he adds: &lsquo;This was
entirely my own idea; nobody had ever thought of it before.&rsquo; One
good trait in Jah&#257;ng&#299;r was his hearty enjoyment of Nature and
his love for flowers. B&#257;bar had this also, but he was old, or at
least worn out, when he came to India, and he was disgusted by an
Indian attempt to poison him, and so his description of India is meagre
and splenetic. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, on the other hand, is a true Indian,
and dwells delightedly on the charms of Indian flowers, particularises
the pal&#257;s, the bok&#363;l, and the champa, and avows that no fruit
of Afghanistan or Central Asia is equal to the mango. He loved, too, to
converse with pandits and Hindu ascetics, though he is contemptuous of
their avatars, and causes the image of Vishnu as the boar avatar to be
broken and flung into the Pushkar lake.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is a remark of Hallam&rsquo;s that the best
attribute of Muhammadan princes is a rigorous justice in chastising the
offences of others. Of this quality Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, in spite of all
his weaknesses, had a large share, and even to this day he is spoken of
with respect by Muhammadans on account of his love of justice. It is a
pathetic circumstance that it was this princely quality which was to
some extent the cause of the great affront put upon him by Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n. Many complaints had been made to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r of
the oppressions of Mah&#257;bat in Bengal, and crowds of suppliants had
come to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s camp. It was his desire to give them
redress and to punish Mah&#257;bat for his exactions, together with his
physical and mental weakness, which led to his capture on the banks of
the Jhilam.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One of the many interesting observations in his
Memoirs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e256" href="#xd24e256" name=
"xd24e256">xiii</a>]</span>is his account of an inscription he saw at
Hindaun. He says that in the thirteenth year of his reign, as he was
marching back to Agra, he found a verse by someone inscribed on the
pillar of a pleasure-house on an islet in the lake at Hindaun. He then
proceeds to quote it, and it turns out to be one of Omar
Khayyam&rsquo;s! This is FitzGerald&rsquo;s paraphrase:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;For some we loved, the loveliest and the
best</p>
<p class="line xd24e261">That from his vintage Time hath prest,</p>
<p class="line">Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,</p>
<p class="line xd24e261">And one by one crept silently to
rest.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">&ldquo;The same quatrain has also been quoted by
Baday&#363;n&#299; in his history, and the interesting thing about
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s quotation of it is that he could see the
beauty of the verse and at the same time did not know who was the
author. There is also an interest in the fact that the third line
contains a different reading from that given in Whinfield&rsquo;s
edition of the text. Hindaun is in the Jaipur territory, and one would
like to know if the inscription still exists.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Among other things in Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s
Memoirs there is the description of the outbreak of the Plague, given
to him by a lady of his court [which has been quoted by Dr. Simpson in
his book upon Plague], and there is a very full account of Kashmir,
which is considerably superior to that in the &#256;y&#299;n
Akbar&#299;, which Sir Walter Lawrence has praised.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">With reference to the portrait of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
prefixed to this volume, it may be interesting to note that it appears
from Mr. E. B. Havell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Indian Sculpture,&rdquo; p. 203,
that the British Museum possesses a drawing by Rembrandt which was
copied from a Moghul miniature, and which has been pronounced by Mr.
Rouffaer to be a portrait of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r. Coryat (Purchas,
reprint, iv, 473) thus describes Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s personal
appearance:&mdash;&ldquo;He is fifty and three years of age, his
nativity-day having been celebrated with wonderful pomp since my
arrival here. On that day he weighed himself in a pair of golden
scales, which by great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e273" href=
"#xd24e273" name="xd24e273">xiv</a>]</span>chance I saw the same day; a
custom he observes most inviolably every year. He is of complexion
neither white nor black, but of a middle betwixt them. I know not how
to express it with a more expressive and significant epitheton than
olive. An olive colour his face presenteth. He is of a seemly
composition of body, of a stature little unequal (as I guess not
without grounds of probability) to mine, but much more corpulent than
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As regards the bibliography of the
T&#363;zuk-i-Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299;, I have to note that there is an
Urdu translation by <span class="corr" id="xd24e277" title=
"Source: Munshi">Munsh&#299;</span> Ah&#803;mad &#703;Al&#299;
S&#299;m&#257;b of R&#257;mp&#363;ra, that is, Aligarh in Tonk. It was
made from Muh&#803;ammad H&#257;d&#299;&rsquo;s edition under the
patronage of Muh&#803;ammad Ibr&#257;h&#299;m &#703;Al&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n Naw&#257;b of Tonk, and was published by Newal Kishor
in 1291 (1874). There is also a Hindi translation by Munsh&#299;
Deb&#299; Pras&#257;d which was published in 1905 at Calcutta by the
Bh&#257;rat Mitra Press. The Urdu translation referred to by Mr.
Blumhardt in his Catalogue of Hindustani MSS., p. 61, and noticed by
Elliot, vi, 401, and Garcin de Tassy, iii, 301, is, as the two latter
writers have remarked, a translation of the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma. The
MS. referred to by Elliot vi, 277, as having been in the possession of
General Thomas Paterson Smith, and which is described in
Eth&eacute;&rsquo;s Catalogue of the India Office MSS., No. 2833, p.
1533, was made by Sayyid Muh&#803;ammad, the elder brother of Sayyid
Ah&#803;mad. <span class="corr" id="xd24e280" title=
"Source: As">At</span> the end of the MS. the copyist gives some
account of himself and of his family. He made the copy from copies in
the Royal Library and in the possession of Rajah Rogh&#363; N&#257;th
Singh <i>alias</i> L&#257;l Singh J&#257;lp&#363;r. He finished it in
October, 1843. Sayyid Muh&#803;ammad was Munsif of Hutg&#257;m in the
Fath&#803;p&#363;r district. He died young in 1845. My friend Mr. T. W.
Arnold, of the India Office, informs me that Sayyid Ah&#803;mad told
him that he found a valuable illustrated MS of the T&#363;zuk in the
d&eacute;bris of the Delhi Royal Library, and took it home, but that it
was lost when his house was plundered <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e286" href="#xd24e286" name="xd24e286">xv</a>]</span>by the
mutineers. There is in the Bodleian a copy in Sayyid
Ah&#803;mad&rsquo;s own handwriting. He states that he made use of ten
good MSS. The Englishman at whose request he made the copy was John
Panton Gubbins, who was once Sessions Judge of Delhi. This copy is
described in the Bodleian Catalogue, p. 117, No. 221. The MS. No. 220
described on the same page was brought home by Fraser, and is a good
one, but only goes down to the end of the 14th year.</p>

<p class="par"><span class="sc">Postscript.</span>&mdash;Since writing
this Preface I have been enabled by the kindness of Mr. Irvine to
examine the Hindi Jah&#257;ng&#299;r-n&#257;ma of Deb&#299;
Pras&#257;d. It is not a translation, but an abstract, and I do not
think it is of much value. Being a Jodhp&#363;r man he has been able,
perhaps, to correct some spellings of places, but he does not seem to
have consulted any MSS., and when he comes to a difficulty he shirks
it. The most valuable adjunct to the T&#363;zuk, after the
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, is the
Ma&#702;&#257;s&#804;ir-i-Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; of K&#257;mg&#257;r
H&#803;usain&#299;. It is important as giving the early history of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, that is, of the time when he was Prince Sel&#299;m.
There are three copies of his work in the British Museum, but the
so-called Ma&#257;thir-i-Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; of the India Office
Library, No. 3098, or 324 of the new Catalogue, is only a copy of the
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma.</p>
<p class="par">I regret that the number of Errata and Addenda is so
large, but when I began the revision I did not know that Sayyid
Ah&#803;mad&rsquo;s text was so incorrect. It will be seen that at pp.
158 and 162 I have made two erroneous notes.</p>

<p class="par first">By the boundless favour of Allah, when one
sidereal hour of Thursday,
Jum&#257;d&#257;-s&#804;-s&#804;&#257;n&#299; 20th, <span class=
"sc">A.H.</span> 1014 (October 24th, 1605), had passed, I ascended the
royal throne in the capital of Agra, in the 38th year of my
age.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e494src" href="#xd24e494" name=

<p class="par">Till he was 28 years old, no child of my father had
lived, and he was continually praying for the survival of a son to
dervishes and recluses, by whom spiritual approach to the throne of
Allah is obtained. As the great master, K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n Chis&#863;ht&#299;, was the fountain-head
of most of the saints of India, he considered that in order to obtain
this object he should have recourse to his blessed threshold, and
resolved within himself that if Almighty God should bestow a son on him
he would, by way of complete humility, go on foot from Agra to his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb2" href="#v1pb2" name=

In <span class="sc">A.H.</span> 977, on Wednesday, 17th
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal (August 31st, 1569), when seven
<i>g&#863;har&#299;</i> of the aforesaid day had passed, when Libra
(M&#299;z&#257;n) had risen to the 24th degree, God Almighty brought me
into existence from the hiding-place of nothingness. At the time when
my venerated father was on the outlook for a son, a dervish of the name
of S&#863;haik&#863;h Sal&#299;m, a man of ecstatic condition, who had
traversed many of the stages of life, had his abode on a hill near
S&#299;kr&#299;, one of the villages of Agra, and the people of that
neighbourhood had complete trust in him. As my father was very
submissive to dervishes, he also visited him. One day, when waiting on
him and in a state of distraction, he asked him how many sons he should
have. The S&#863;haik&#863;h replied, &ldquo;The Giver who gives
without being asked will bestow three sons on you.&rdquo; My father
said, &ldquo;I have made a vow that, casting my first son on the skirt
of your favour, I will make your friendship and kindness his protector
and preserver.&rdquo; The S&#863;haik&#863;h accepted this idea, and
said, &ldquo;I congratulate you, and I will give him my own
name.&rdquo; When my mother came near the time of her delivery, he
(Akbar) sent her to the S&#863;haik&#863;h&rsquo;s house that I might
be born there. After my birth they gave me the name of Sultan
Sal&#299;m, but I never heard my father, whether in his cups or in his
sober moments, call me Muh&#803;ammad Sal&#299;m or Sultan Sal&#299;m,
but always <i>S&#863;haik&#863;h&#363; B&#257;b&#257;</i>. My revered
father, considering the village of S&#299;kr&#299;, which was the place
of my birth, lucky for him, made it his capital. In the course of
fourteen or fifteen years that hill, full of wild beasts, became a city
containing all kinds of gardens and buildings, and lofty, elegant
edifices and pleasant places, attractive to the heart. After the
conquest of Gujar&#257;t this village was named Fath&#803;p&#363;r.
When I became king it occurred to me to change my name, because this
resembled that of the Emperor of R&#363;m. An inspiration from the
hidden world brought it into my mind <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb3" href="#v1pb3" name="v1pb3">3</a>]</span>that, inasmuch as the
business of kings is the controlling of the world, I should give myself
the name of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r (World-seizer) and make my title of
honour (<i>laqab</i>) N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n, inasmuch as my sitting on
the throne coincided with the rising and shining on the earth of the
great light (the Sun). I had also heard, in the days when I was a
prince, from Indian sages, that after the expiration of the reign and
life of King Jal&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n Akbar one named
N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n would be administrator of the affairs of the
State. Therefore I gave myself the name and appellation of
N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Jah&#257;ng&#299;r P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h. As
this great event took place in Agra, it is necessary that some account
of that city should be given.</p>
<p class="par">Agra is one of the grand old cities of Hindustan. It had
formerly an old fort on the bank of the Jumna, but this my father threw
down before my birth, and he founded a fort of cut red stone, the like
of which those who have travelled over the world cannot point out. It
was completed in the space of fifteen or sixteen years. It had four
gates and two sally-ports, and its cost was 35 lakhs of rupees, equal
to 115,000 <i>tom&#257;n</i> of current Persian coinage and to
10,500,000 <i>k&#863;h&#257;n&#299;</i> according to the
T&#363;r&#257;n reckoning. The habitable part of the city extends on
both sides of the river. On its west side, which has the greater
population, its circumference is seven kos and its breadth is one kos.
The circumference of the inhabited part on the other side of the water,
the side towards the east, is 2&frac12; kos, its length being one kos
and its breadth half a kos. But in the number of its buildings it is
equal to several cities of &#703;Ir&#257;q, K&#863;hur&#257;s&#257;n,
and M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr (Transoxiana) put together. Many
persons have erected buildings of three or four storeys in it. The mass
of people is so great, that moving about in the lanes and bazars is
difficult. It is on the boundary of the second climate. On its east is
the province of Qanauj; on the west, N&#257;gor; on the north, Sambhal;
and on the south, Chander&#299;.</p>
<p class="par">It is written in the books of the Hindus that the source
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb4" href="#v1pb4" name=
"v1pb4">4</a>]</span>of the Jumna is in a hill of the name of
Kalind,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e537src" href="#xd24e537" name=
"xd24e537src">2</a> which men cannot reach because of the excessive
cold. The apparent source is a hill near the pargana of
K&#863;hiz&#803;r&#257;b&#257;d.</p>
<p class="par">The air of Agra is warm and dry; physicians say that it
depresses the spirits (<i>r&#363;h&#803;r&#257; ba tah&#803;l&#299;l
m&#299;barad</i>) and induces weakness. It is unsuited to most
temperaments, except to the phlegmatic and melancholy, which are safe
from its bad effects. For this reason animals of this constitution and
temperament, such as the elephant, the buffalo, and others, thrive in
its climate.</p>
<p class="par">Before the rule of the Lod&#299; Afghans, Agra was a
great and populous place, and had a castle described by
Mas&#703;&#363;d b. Sa&#703;d b. Salm&#257;n in the ode
(<i>qa&#7779;&#299;da</i>) which he wrote in praise of
Mah&#803;m&#363;d, son of Sultan Ibr&#257;h&#299;m, son of
Mas&#703;&#363;d, son of Sultan Mah&#803;m&#363;d of G&#863;hazn&#299;,
on the capture of the castle&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The fort of Agra appeared in the midst of the

<p class="par first">When Sikandar Lod&#299; designed to take Gwalior
he came to Agra from Delhi, which was the capital of the Sultans of
India, and settled down there. From that date the population and
prosperity of Agra increased, and it became the capital of the Sultans
of Delhi. When God Almighty bestowed the rule of India on this
illustrious family, the late king, B&#257;bar, after the defeat of
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m, the son of Sikandar Lod&#299;, and his being killed,
and after his victory over R&#257;n&#257; S&#257;ng&#257;, who was the
chief of the Rajas of Hindustan, established on the east side of the
Jumna, on improved land, a garden (<i>ch&#257;rb&#257;g&#863;h</i>)
which few places equal in beauty. He gave it the name of
Gul-afs&#863;h&#257;n <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb5" href=
"#v1pb5" name="v1pb5">5</a>]</span>(Flower-scatterer), and erected in
it a small building of cut red stone, and having completed a mosque on
one side of it he intended to make a lofty building, but time failed
him and his design was never carried into execution.</p>
<p class="par">In these Memoirs, whenever <i>&#7778;&#257;h&#803;ib
qir&#257;n&#299;</i> is written it refers to Am&#299;r T&#299;m&#363;r
G&#363;rg&#257;n; and whenever <i>Fird&#363;s-mak&#257;n&#299;</i> is
mentioned, to B&#257;bar P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h; when
<i>Jannat-&#257;s&#863;hy&#257;n&#299;</i> is used, to
Hum&#257;y&#363;n P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h; and when
<i>&#703;Ars&#863;h-&#257;s&#863;hy&#257;n&#299;</i> is employed, to my
revered father, Jal&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n Muh&#803;ammad Akbar
P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;.</p>
<p class="par">Melons, mangoes, and other fruits grow well in Agra and
its neighbourhood. Of all fruits I am very fond of mangoes. In the
reign of my father
(<i>&#703;Ars&#863;h-&#257;s&#863;hy&#257;n&#299;</i>) many fruits of
other countries, which till then were not to be had in India, were
obtained there. Several sorts of grapes, such as the
<i>&#7779;&#257;h&#803;ib&#299;</i> and the
<i>h&#803;abs&#863;h&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e602src" href=
"#xd24e602" name="xd24e602src">4</a> and the
<i>kis&#863;hmis&#863;h&#299;</i>, became common in several towns; for
instance, in the bazars of Lahore every kind and variety that may be
desired can be had in the grape season. Among fruits, one which they
call <i>anan&#257;s</i> (pineapple), which is grown in the Frank
ports,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e624src" href="#xd24e624" name=
"xd24e624src">5</a> is of excessive fragrance and fine flavour. Many
thousands are produced every year now in the Gul-afs&#863;h&#257;n
garden at Agra.</p>
<p class="par">From the excellencies of its sweet-scented flowers one
may prefer the fragrances of India to those of the flowers of the whole
world. It has many such that nothing in the whole world can be compared
to them. The first is the <i>champa</i> (<i>Michelia champaca</i>),
which is a flower of exceedingly sweet fragrance; it has the shape of
the saffron-flower, but is yellow inclining to white. The tree is very
symmetrical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb6" href="#v1pb6" name=
"v1pb6">6</a>]</span>and large, full of branches and leaves, and is
shady. When in flower one tree will perfume a garden. Surpassing this
is the <i>keo&#7771;&#257;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e642src" href=
"#xd24e642" name="xd24e642src">6</a> flower (<i>Pandanus
odoratissimus</i>). Its shape and appearance are singular, and its
scent is so strong and penetrating that it does not yield to the odour
of musk. Another is the <i>r&#257;e bel</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e652src" href="#xd24e652" name="xd24e652src">7</a> which in scent
resembles white jessamine. Its flowers are double and treble (?).
Another is the <i>m&#363;lsar&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e672src" href="#xd24e672" name="xd24e672src">8</a> (<i>Mimusops
Elengi</i>). This tree, too, is very graceful and symmetrical, and is
shady. The scent of its flowers is very pleasant. Another is the
<i>ketak&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e695src" href="#xd24e695"
name="xd24e695src">9</a> (<i>Pandanus</i> ?), which is of the nature of
the <i>keo&#7771;&#257;</i>, but the latter is thorny, whereas the
<i>ketk&#299;</i> has no thorns. Moreover, the <i>ketk&#299;</i> is
yellowish, whereas the <i>keo&#7771;&#257;</i> is white. From these two
flowers and also from the <i>chambel&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e758src" href="#xd24e758" name="xd24e758src">10</a> (<i>Jasminum
grandiflorum</i>), which is the white jessamine of <i>wil&#257;yat</i>
(Persia or Afghanistan), they extract sweet-scented oils. There are
other flowers too numerous to mention. Of trees there are the cypress
(<i>sarw</i>), the pine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb7" href=
"#v1pb7" name="v1pb7">7</a>]</span>(<i>san&#363;bar</i>), the
<i>chanar</i> (<i>Platanus orientalis</i>), the white poplar
(<i>saf&#299;d&#257;r</i>, <i>Populus alba</i>), and the <i>b&#299;d
m&#363;ll&#257;</i> (willow), which they had formerly never thought of
in Hindustan, but are now plentiful. The sandal-tree, which once was
peculiar to the islands (i.e., Java, Sumatra, etc.), also flourishes in
the gardens.</p>
<p class="par">The inhabitants of Agra exert themselves greatly in the
acquirement of crafts and the search after learning. Various professors
of every religion and creed have taken up their abode in the city.</p>
<p class="par">After my accession, the first order that I gave was for
the fastening up of the Chain of Justice, so that if those engaged in
the administration of justice should delay or practise hypocrisy in the
matter of those seeking justice, the oppressed might come to this chain
and shake it so that its noise might attract attention. Its fashion was
this: I ordered them to make a chain of pure gold,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e795src" href="#xd24e795" name="xd24e795src">11</a> 30
<i>gaz</i> in length and containing 60 bells. Its weight was 4 Indian
maunds, equal to 42 &#703;Ir&#257;q&#299; maunds. One end of it they
made fast to the battlements of the Sh&#257;h Burj of the fort at Agra
and the other to a stone post fixed on the bank of the river. I also
gave twelve orders to be observed as rules of conduct
(<i>dast&#363;ru-l-&#703;amal</i>) in all my dominions&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">(1) Forbidding the levy of cesses under the names of
<i>tamgh&#257;</i> and <i>m&#299;r bah&#803;r&#299;</i> (river tolls),
and other burdens which the <i>j&#257;g&#299;rd&#257;rs</i> of every
province and district had imposed for their own profit.</p>
<p class="par">(2) On roads where thefts and robberies took place,
which roads might be at a little distance from habitations, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb8" href="#v1pb8" name=
"v1pb8">8</a>]</span><i>j&#257;g&#299;rd&#257;rs</i> of the
neighbourhood should build <i>sar&#257;&#702;&#299;s</i> (public
rest-houses), mosques, and dig wells, which might stimulate population,
and people might settle down in those <i>sar&#257;&#702;&#299;s</i>. If
these should be near a <i>k&#863;h&#257;li&#7779;a</i> estate (under
direct State management), the administrator
(<i>muta&#7779;add&#299;</i>) of that place should execute the
work.</p>
<p class="par"><a class="noteref" id="xd24e834src" href="#xd24e834"
name="xd24e834src">12</a>(3) The bales of merchants should not be
opened on the roads without informing them and obtaining their
leave.</p>
<p class="par">(4) In my dominions if anyone, whether unbeliever or
Musalman, should die, his property and effects should be left for his
heirs, and no one should interfere with them. If he should have no
heir, they should appoint inspectors and separate guardians to guard
the property, so that its value might be expended in lawful
expenditure, such as the building of mosques and
<i>sar&#257;&#702;&#299;s</i>, the repair of broken bridges, and the
digging of tanks and wells.</p>
<p class="par">(5) They should not make wine or rice-spirit
(<i>darbahra</i>)<a class="noteref" id="xd24e847src" href="#xd24e847"
name="xd24e847src">13</a> or any kind of intoxicating drug, or sell
them; although I myself drink wine, and from the age of 18 years up
till now, when I am 38, have persisted in it. When I first took a
liking to drinking I sometimes took as much as twenty cups of
double-distilled spirit; when by degrees it acquired a great influence
over me I endeavoured to lessen the quantity, and in the period of
seven years I have brought myself from fifteen cups to five or six. My
times for drinking were varied; sometimes when three or four sidereal
hours of the day remained I would begin to drink, and sometimes at
night and partly by day. This went on till I was 30 years old. After
that I took to drinking always at night. Now I drink only to digest my
food.</p>
<p class="par"><a class="noteref" id="xd24e854src" href="#xd24e854"
name="xd24e854src">14</a>(6) They should not take possession of any
person&rsquo;s house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb9" href=
"#v1pb9" name="v1pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">(7) I forbade the cutting off the nose or ears of any
person, and I myself made a vow by the throne of God that I would not
blemish anyone by this punishment.</p>
<p class="par">(8) I gave an order that the officials of the Crown
lands and the <i>j&#257;g&#299;rd&#257;rs</i> should not forcibly take
the ryots&rsquo; lands and cultivate them on their own account.</p>
<p class="par">(9) A government collector or a
<i>j&#257;g&#299;rd&#257;r</i> should not without permission intermarry
with the people of the <i>pargana</i> in which he might be.</p>
<p class="par">(10) They should found hospitals in the great cities,
and appoint physicians for the healing of the sick; whatever the
expenditure might be, should be given from the
<i>k&#863;h&#257;li&#7779;a</i> establishment.</p>
<p class="par">(11) In accordance with the regulations of my revered
father, I ordered that each year from the 18th<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e881src" href="#xd24e881" name="xd24e881src">15</a> of
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal, which is my birthday, for a number of days
corresponding to the years of my life, they should not slaughter
animals (for food). Two days in each week were also forbidden, one of
them Thursday, the day of my accession, and the other Sunday, the day
of my father&rsquo;s birth. He held this day in great esteem on this
account, and because it was dedicated to the Sun, and also because it
was the day on which the Creation began. Therefore it was one of the
days on which there was no killing in his dominions.<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e896src" href="#xd24e896" name="xd24e896src">16</a></p>
<p class="par">(12) I gave a general order that the offices and
<i>j&#257;g&#299;rs</i> of my father&rsquo;s servants should remain as
they were. Later, the <i><span class="corr" id="xd24e905" title=
"Source: man&#7779;abs">mansabs</span></i> (ranks or offices) were
increased according to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb10" href=
"#v1pb10" name="v1pb10">10</a>]</span>each one&rsquo;s circumstances by
not less than 20 per cent. to 300 or 400 per cent. The subsistence
money of the <i>ah&#803;ad&#299;s</i> was increased by 50 per cent.,
and I raised the pay of all domestics by 20 per cent. I increased the
allowances of all the veiled ladies of my father&rsquo;s harem from 20
per cent. to 100 per cent., according to their condition and
relationship. By one stroke of the pen I confirmed the subsistence
lands<a class="noteref" id="xd24e913src" href="#xd24e913" name=
"xd24e913src">17</a> of the holders of <i>aimas</i> (charity lands)
within the dominions, who form the army of prayer, according to the
deeds in their possession. I gave an order to M&#299;r&#257;n
&#7778;adr Jah&#257;n, who is one of the genuine Sayyids of India, and
who for a long time held the high office of <i>&#7779;adr</i>
(ecclesiastical officer) under my father, that he should every day
produce before me deserving people (worthy of charity). <a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e929src" href="#xd24e929" name="xd24e929src">18</a>I

when I left Allahabad to wait upon my honoured father I presented him
with a drum and the <i>t&#363;m&#257;n-tog&#863;h</i> (standard of
<i>y&#257;k</i> tails). I had also promoted him to the rank of 2,500
and given him the government of the province of Bihar. I gave him
complete control over the province, and sent him off there. On the 4th
of Rajab, being fifteen days after my accession, he waited upon me. I
was exceedingly pleased at his coming, for his connection with me is
such that I look upon him as a brother, a son, a friend, and a
companion. As I had perfect confidence in his friendship, intelligence,
learning, and acquaintance with affairs, having made him Grand Vizier,
I promoted him to the rank of 5,000 with 5,000 horse and the lofty
title of <i>Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257;</i>, to which no title of my
servants is superior. Though his position might have warranted a higher
rank, he himself represented to me that until some notable service on
his part had become perceptible to me he would not accept a higher
grade than that mentioned (5,000).</p>
<p class="par">As the reality of the loyalty of my father&rsquo;s
servants had not yet become apparent, and certain faults and errors and
unbecoming intentions which were not approved at the throne of the
Creator or pleasing to His creatures had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

they of themselves became ashamed. Though on the day of my accession I
had forgiven all offences and determined with myself that I would exact
no retribution for past deeds, yet on account of the suspicion that had
been aroused in my mind about them I considered the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; my guardian and protector; although God
Almighty is the guardian of all His servants, and is especially so of
kings, because their existence is the cause of the contentment of the
world. His father, &#703;Abdu-&#7779;-&#7778;amad, who in the art of
painting had no equal in the age, had obtained from the late king
(<i>Jannat-&#257;s&#863;hy&#257;n&#299;</i>) Hum&#257;y&#363;n the
title of <i>S&#863;h&#299;r&#299;n-qalam</i> (Sweet pen), and in his
council had attained a great dignity and was on intimate terms with him
(the king). He was one of the chief men of S&#863;h&#299;r&#257;z. My
honoured father, on account of his former services, paid him great
honour and reverence. I made Raja M&#257;n Singh&mdash;who was one of
the greatest and most trusted noblemen of my father, and had obtained
alliances with this illustrious family, inasmuch as his aunt had been
in my father&rsquo;s house (i.e. was his wife),<a class="noteref" id=

Sult&#804;&#257;nu-n-nis&#257; Begam, the latter of whom is my eldest
child, were born of her&mdash;as before, ruler of the province of
Bengal. Though as in consequence of certain of his acts he had no
expectation of this favour towards himself, I dignified him with a
<i>ch&#257;rqab</i> (vest without sleeves) as a robe of honour, a
jewelled sword, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb16" href=
"#v1pb16" name="v1pb16">16</a>]</span>one of my own horses, and sent
him off to his province, which is a place of (or can keep up) 50,000
horse. His father was Raja Bhagw&#257;n D&#257;s. His grandfather, Raja
Bih&#257;r&#299; Mal, was the first of the Kachw&#257;ha
R&#257;jp&#363;ts to have the honour of entering my father&rsquo;s
service, and he excelled his tribe in truth and sincerity of
friendship, and in the quality of valour. After my accession, when all
the nobles with their retinues presented themselves at my palace, it
came into my mind that I should send this body of retainers under my
son, Sultan Parw&#299;z, to make a holy war against the R&#257;n&#257;,
who was one of evil deeds, and a foul infidel of the country of
Hindustan, and in my father&rsquo;s time had had troops sent constantly
against him, but had not been driven off. In a fortunate hour I
invested my said son with gorgeous robes of honour, a jewelled
waist-sword, a jewelled waist-dagger, and a rosary of pearls intermixed
with rubies of great price of the value of 72,000 rupees,
&#703;Ir&#257;q and Turkm&#257;n horses and famous elephants, and
dismissed him. About 20,000 horsemen with nobles and chief leaders were
appointed to this service. The first was &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n, who in my father&rsquo;s time was one of his
confidential servants, and for a long time had been confirmed in the
post of bakhshi and afterwards became <i>d&#299;w&#257;n ba
istiql&#257;l</i> (Chancellor with full powers); him I advanced from
the rank of an Am&#299;r to that of Vizier, and promoting him from the
command of 2,500 horse to that of 5,000 made him guardian to
Parw&#299;z. Having honoured him with a robe of honour, jewelled
waist-sword, a horse and an elephant, I ordered that all the
<i>man&#7779;abd&#257;rs</i> (commanders), small and great, should not
depart from such orders as he thought proper to give them. I made
&#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299; his bakhshi and
Muk&#863;ht&#257;r Beg, &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s
paternal uncle, diwan to Parw&#299;z. I also presented to Raja

5,000, a robe of honour and a jewelled waist-sword.</p>

leave to join the expedition. He is of the tribe of the

father bestowed many favours. He had learned the Persian language, and,

attributed to any one of his tribe, he is not without intelligence. He
makes Persian verses, and the following is one of his

province of Mairtha and is greater in loyalty than his contemporaries,
I promoted to the rank of 1,500. I directed the <i>&#703;ulam&#257;</i>

appellations of God which were easy to remember, in order that I might

&#7778;adr Jah&#257;n has acted towards me with single-minded loyalty,
and I regard him as my preceptor in religions matters
(<i>k&#863;hal&#299;fa</i>). Whilst I was prince and before my revered
father&rsquo;s illness, and during that time, when the ministers
(pillars of the State) and the high nobles had become agitated, and
each had conceived some idea of gain for himself and wished to become
the originator of some act which could only bring ruin on the State, he
had not failed in the activity of his service and devotedness. Having
made &#703;In&#257;yat Beg,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1411src" href=
"#xd24e1411" name="xd24e1411src">52</a> who for a long period in the
reign of my father had been Master of Works
(<i>D&#299;w&#257;n-i-buy&#363;t&#257;t</i>) and held the rank of 700,
half-vizier of my dominions in the place of Waz&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n,
I gave him the high title of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula with the rank
of 1,500, and I appointed Waz&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n to the
<i>D&#299;w&#257;n&#299;</i> of the province of Bengal, and assigned to
him the settlement of the revenues thereof. To Patr D&#257;s, who in
the time of my father had the title of R&#257;y R&#257;y&#257;n, I gave
the title of Raja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t. The latter was one of the great
Rajas of India, and it was in his reign that astronomical observatories
were established in India. I made Patr D&#257;s Master of Ordnance, and
ordered that he should always have light artillery<a class="noteref"

<i>khatr&#299;</i> by caste, and rose in my father&rsquo;s service from
being accountant of the elephants&rsquo; stables to be diwan and an
amir. He is not wanting in military qualities and in administrative
skill. I made K&#863;hurram, the son of K&#863;h&#257;n
A&#703;z&#804;am (&#703;Az&#299;z Koka), who had had the rank of 2,000,
an officer of 2,500.</p>
<p class="par">As it was my desire that many of the Akbar&#299; and
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; officers should obtain the fruition of their
wishes, I informed the bakhshis that whoever wished to have his
birthplace made into his jagir should make a representation to that
effect, so that in accordance with the Ching&#299;z canon
(<i>t&#363;ra</i>) the estate might be conveyed to him by <i>&#257;l

adorned the farmans for these with the <i>&#257;l tamg&#863;h&#257;</i>

I count him as a son, and have promoted him to the rank of 1,000. I
also promoted Bh&#257;o Singh, son of Raja M&#257;n Singh and the most
capable of his sons, from his original rank to that of 1,500. I raised

has served me personally from his childhood, and who, when I was
prince, rose from the grade of an ahadi to that of 500, giving him the
title of Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n and the rank of 1,500. He was
confirmed as bakhshi of my private establishment
(<i>s&#863;h&#257;gird-p&#299;s&#863;ha</i>).</p>
<p class="par">I promoted Raja B&#299;r Singh Deo, a Bandela Rajput,
who had obtained my favour, and who excels his equals and relatives in
valour, personal goodness, and simple-heartedness, to the rank of
3,000. The reason for his advancement and for the regard shown to him
was that near the end of my revered father&rsquo;s time,
S&#863;haik&#863;h Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l, who excelled the
S&#863;haik&#863;hz&#257;das of Hindustan in wisdom and learning, had
adorned himself outwardly with the jewel of sincerity, and sold it to
my father at a heavy price. He had been summoned from the Deccan, and,
since his feelings towards me were not honest, he both publicly and
privately spoke against me. At this period when, through
strife-exciting intriguers, the august feelings of my royal father were
entirely embittered against me, it was certain that if he obtained the
honour of waiting on him (Akbar) it would be the cause of more
confusion, and would preclude me <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb25"
href="#v1pb25" name="v1pb25">25</a>]</span>from the favour of union
with him (my father). It became necessary to prevent him from coming to
Court. As B&#299;r Singh Deo&rsquo;s country was exactly on his route
and he was then a rebel, I sent him a message that if he would stop
that sedition-monger and kill him he would receive every kindness from
me. By God&rsquo;s grace, when S&#863;haik&#863;h Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l
was passing through B&#299;r Singh Deo&rsquo;s country, the Raja
blocked his road, and after a little contest scattered his men and
killed him. He sent his head to me in Allahabad. Although this event
was a cause of anger in the mind of the late king (Akbar), in the end
it enabled me to proceed without disturbance of mind to kiss the
threshold of my father&rsquo;s palace, and by degrees the resentment of
the king was cleared away.</p>
<p class="par">I made M&#299;r Z&#803;iy&#257;&#702;u-d-d&#299;n of
Qazw&#299;n, who had done me service in the days of my princehood and
had shown loyalty, commander of 1,000 and accountant of the stables. An
order was given that every day thirty horses should be produced before
me for the purpose of making presents. I honoured M&#299;rz&#257;
&#703;Al&#299; Akbars&#863;h&#257;h&#299;, who is one of the
distinguished braves of this family,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1529src" href="#xd24e1529" name="xd24e1529src">59</a> with the
rank of 4,000, and gave him the sarkar of Sambhal as his jagir.</p>
<p class="par">One day the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; (S&#863;har&#299;f
K&#863;h&#257;n) greatly pleased me by an incidental remark. It was
this: &ldquo;Honesty and dishonesty are not confined to matters of cash
and goods; to represent qualities as existing in acquaintances which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb26" href="#v1pb26" name=
"v1pb26">26</a>]</span>do not exist, and to conceal the meritorious
qualities of strangers, is dishonesty. In truth, honesty of speech
consists in making no distinction between intimates and strangers and
in describing each man as he really is.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When I sent off Parw&#299;z I had said to him, &ldquo;If
the R&#257;n&#257; himself, and his eldest son who is called Karan,
should come to wait upon you and proffer service and obedience, you
should not do any injury to his territory.&rdquo; My intention in this
recommendation was of two kinds; one, that inasmuch as the conquest of
Transoxiana was always in the pure mind of my revered father, though
every time he determined on it things occurred to prevent it, if this
business could be settled, and this danger dismissed from my mind, I
would leave Parw&#299;z in Hindustan, and in reliance on Allah, myself
start for my hereditary territories, especially as at this time there
was no permanent ruler in that region. B&#257;q&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n,
who, after &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n and
&#703;Abdu-l-Mu&#702;m&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n, his son, had acquired
complete independence, had died, and the affairs of Wal&#299;
Muh&#803;ammad K&#863;h&#257;n, his brother, who is now the ruler of
that region, had not as yet been brought into proper order. Secondly,
to bring about the termination of the war in the Deccan, of which a
part in the time of my revered father had been acquired, so that it
might come into possession, and be incorporated with the Imperial
dominions. My hope is that through the favour of Allah both these
undertakings will be accomplished.</p>

also with this distinction. Notwithstanding the mischievous

<p class="par">On Sha&#703;b&#257;n 27th (28th December, 1605) a
strange thing was done by the sons of Akhayr&#257;j, son of
Bhagw&#257;n D&#257;s, the paternal uncle<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1624src" href="#xd24e1624" name="xd24e1624src">66</a> of Raja
M&#257;n Singh. These unlucky ones, who bore the names of Abhay
R&#257;m, Bijay R&#257;m, and Shy&#257;m R&#257;m, were exceedingly
immoderate. Notwithstanding that the aforesaid Abhay R&#257;m had done
improper (disproportioned) acts, I had winked at his faults. When at
this date it was represented to me that this wretch was desirous of
despatching his wives and children without leave to his own country and
afterwards of himself running away to the R&#257;n&#257;, who is not
loyal to this family, I referred to R&#257;m D&#257;s and other Rajput
nobles, and said to them that if any one of them would become security
for them, I would confirm the rank and jagir of those wretches, and
passing over their offences would forgive them. In consequence of their
excessive turbulence and bad disposition no one became security. I told
the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; that as no one would be bound for them,
they must be handed over to the charge of one of the servants of the
Court until security was forthcoming. The Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; gave
them over to Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n K&#257;kar, who was

them to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb30" href="#v1pb30" name=

himself to driving them off, and I sent S&#863;haik&#863;h Far&#299;d
also after him. One Rajput armed with a sword, and another with a
dagger stood up to the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257;. One of his attendants
named Qut&#804;b engaged the man with the dagger and was killed. The
Rajput also was cut to pieces. One of the Afghan attendants of the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; attacked the one who had the sword and killed
him. Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n drew his dagger and turned towards
Abhay R&#257;m, who with two others was holding his ground, and after
wounding one of these fell down after receiving wounds from the three.
Some of the ahadis and the men of the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; opposed
and slew these doomed men. A Rajput drew his sword and turned to
S&#863;haik&#863;h Far&#299;d; he was met by a H&#803;abs&#863;h&#299;

childhood, and may be a year younger than I. He is a brave and
well-dispositioned youth, and is distinguished in every way above his
family. Till now he has never drunk intoxicating drinks, and his
sincerity towards me is such that I have honoured him with the title of
son.</p>
<p class="par">I have bestowed on &#703;Al&#299; A&#7779;g&#863;har

father&rsquo;s old nobles, the title of Saif K&#863;h&#257;n, and thus
distinguished him amongst his equals and connections. He is evidently a
brave youth. He was always one of the confidential men who went with me
to hunt and to other places. He has never in his life drunk anything
intoxicating, and as he has abstained in his youth he probably will
attain high dignities. I granted him the rank of 3,000.</p>
<p class="par">I promoted Far&#299;d&#363;n, son of Muh&#803;ammad
Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n Barl&#257;s, who held the rank of 1,000, to
that of 2,000. Far&#299;d&#363;n is one of the tribe of
Chag&#863;hat&#257;y, and is not devoid of manliness and courage.</p>
<p class="par">I promoted S&#863;haik&#863;h B&#257;yaz&#299;d,
grandson of S&#863;haik&#863;h Sal&#299;m, who held the rank of 2,000,

the wise men of the Hindus, &ldquo;If the doctrines of your religion
are based on the incarnation of the Holy Person of God Almighty in ten
different forms by the process of metempsychosis, they are virtually
rejected by the intelligent. This pernicious idea requires that the
Sublime Cause, who is void of all limitations, should be possessed of
length, breadth, and thickness. If the purpose is the manifestation of
the Light of God in these bodies, that of itself is existent equally in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb33" href="#v1pb33" name=

ten forms. If the idea is to establish some one of God&rsquo;s
attributes, even then there is no right notion, for in every faith and
code there are masters of wonders and miracles distinguished beyond the
other men of their age for wisdom and eloquence.&rdquo;<a class=

therefore made these ten forms the means of conceiving of and knowing
Him.&rdquo; Then said I, &ldquo;How can these forms be a means of your
approaching the Deity?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">My father always associated with the learned of every
creed and religion, especially with Pandits and the learned of India,
and although he was illiterate, so much became clear to him through
constant intercourse with the learned and wise, in his conversations
with them, that no one knew him to be illiterate, and he was so
acquainted with the niceties of verse and prose compositions that his
deficiency was not thought of.</p>
<p class="par">In his august personal appearance he was of middle
height, but inclining to be tall; he was of the hue of wheat; his eyes
and eyebrows were black, and his complexion rather dark than fair; he
was lion-bodied,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1695src" href="#xd24e1695"

in appearance, of the size <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb34" href=

the science of physiognomy considered this mole a sign of great
prosperity and exceeding good fortune. His august voice was very loud,

God manifested itself in him.</p>

<p class="par first">Three months after my birth my sister,
S&#863;h&#257;hz&#257;da K&#863;h&#257;nam, was born to one of the
royal concubines; they gave her over to his (Akbar&rsquo;s) mother,
Maryam Mak&#257;n&#299;. After her a son was born to one of the
concubines, and received the name of S&#863;h&#257;h Mur&#257;d. As his
birth occurred in the hill country of Fath&#803;p&#363;r, he was
nicknamed <i>Pah&#257;r&#299;</i>. When my revered father sent him to
conquer the Deccan, he had taken to excessive drinking through
associating with unworthy persons, so that he died in his 30th year, in
the neighbourhood of J&#257;ln&#257;p&#363;r, in the province of Berar.
His personal appearance was fresh-coloured; he was thin in body and
tall of stature. Dignity and authority were evident in his movements,
and manliness and bravery manifested themselves in his ways. On the
night of Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal 10th, <span class="sc">A.H.</span>
979 (September, 1572), another son was born to one of the concubines.
As his birth took place at Ajm&#299;r in the house of one of the
attendants of the blessed shrine of the reverend K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n Chis&#863;ht&#299;, whose name was
S&#863;haik&#863;h D&#257;niy&#257;l, this child was called
D&#257;niy&#257;l.</p>
<p class="par">After the death of my brother S&#863;h&#257;h
Mur&#257;d, he (Akbar), towards the end of his reign, sent
D&#257;niy&#257;l to conquer the Deccan and followed him himself. When
my revered father was besieging &#256;s&#299;r (&#256;s&#299;rgarh) he,
with a large body of nobles such as the
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n and his sons and M&#299;rz&#257;
Y&#363;suf K&#863;h&#257;n, invested the fort of Ahmadnagar, and it
came <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb35" href="#v1pb35" name=
"v1pb35">35</a>]</span>into the possession of the victorious officers
about the time that &#256;s&#299;r was taken. After my father
&#703;Ars&#863;h-&#257;s&#863;hy&#257;n&#299; had returned in
prosperity and victory from Burhanpur towards his capital, he gave the
province to D&#257;niy&#257;l and left him in possession of that
territory. D&#257;niy&#257;l took to improper ways, like his brother
S&#863;h&#257;h Mur&#257;d, and soon died from excessive drinking, in
the 33rd year of his age. His death occurred in a peculiar way. He was
very fond of guns and of hunting with the gun. He named one of his guns
<i>yaka u jan&#257;za</i>, &lsquo;the same as the bier,&rsquo; and
himself composed this couplet and had it engraved on the
gun:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;From the joy of the chase with thee, life is

<p class="par first">When his drinking of wine was carried to excess,
and the circumstance was reported to my father, farmans of reproach
were sent to the K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n. Of course he
forbade it, and placed cautious people to look after him properly. When
the road to bring wine was completely closed, he began to weep and to
importune some of his servants, and said: &ldquo;Let them bring me wine
in any possible way.&rdquo; He said to Murs&#863;hid Qul&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n, a musketeer who was in his immediate service:
&ldquo;Pour some wine into this <i>yaka u jan&#257;za</i>, and bring it
to me.&rdquo; That wretch, in hope of favour, undertook to do this, and
poured double-distilled spirit into the gun, which had long been
nourished on gunpowder and the scent thereof, and brought it. The rust
of the iron was dissolved by the strength of the spirit and mingled
with it, and the prince no sooner drank of it than he fell down.</p>

<p class="par">D&#257;niy&#257;l was of pleasing figure, of exceedingly
agreeable manners and appearance; he was very fond of elephants and
horses. It was impossible for him to hear of anyone as having a good
horse or elephant and not take it from him. He was fond of Hindi songs,
and would occasionally compose verses with correct idiom in the
language of the people of India, which were not bad.</p>
<p class="par">After the birth of D&#257;niy&#257;l a daughter was born
to B&#299;b&#299; Daulat-S&#863;h&#257;d whom they named
S&#863;hakaru-n-nis&#257; Begam.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1770src"

the skirt of my revered father&rsquo;s care, she turned out very well.
She is of good disposition and naturally compassionate towards all
people. From infancy and childhood she has been extremely fond of me,
and there can be few such relationships between brother and sister. The
first time when, according to the custom of pressing the breast of a
child and a drop of milk is perceptible, they pressed my sister&rsquo;s
breast and milk appeared, my revered father said to me:
&ldquo;B&#257;b&#257;! drink this milk, that in truth this sister may
be to thee as a mother.&rdquo; God, the knower of secrets, knows that
from that day forward, after I drank that drop of milk, I have felt
love for my sister such as children have for their mothers.</p>
<p class="par">After some time another girl was born to this same
B&#299;b&#299; Daulat-S&#863;h&#257;d, and he (Akbar) called her
&#256;r&#257;m B&#257;n&#363; Begam.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1775src" href="#xd24e1775" name="xd24e1775src">84</a> Her
disposition was on the whole inclined to excitement and heat. My father
was very fond of her, so much so that he described her impolitenesses
as politenesses, and in his august sight they, from his great love, did
not appear bad. Repeatedly he honoured me by addressing me, and said:
&ldquo;B&#257;b&#257;! for my sake be as kind as I am, after me, to
this sister, who in Hindi phrase is my darling <span class=

her and pass over her little impolitenesses and impudences.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The good qualities of my revered father are beyond the
limit of approval and the bounds of praise. If books were composed with
regard to his commendable dispositions, without suspicion of
extravagance, and he be not looked at as a father would be by his son,
even then but a little out of much could be said.</p>
<p class="par">Notwithstanding his kingship and his treasures and his
buried wealth, which were beyond the scope of counting and imagination,
his fighting elephants and Arab horses, he never by a hair&rsquo;s
breadth placed his foot beyond the base of humility before the throne
of God, but considered himself the lowest of created beings, and never
for one moment forgot God.</p>

<p class="par first">The professors of various faiths had room in the
broad expanse of his incomparable sway. This was different from the
practice in other realms, for in Persia<a class="noteref" id=

room for Shias only, and in Turkey, India, and T&#363;r&#257;n there is
room for Sunnis only.</p>
<p class="par">As in the wide expanse of the Divine compassion there is
room for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so, on the
principle that the Shadow<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1797src" href=
"#xd24e1797" name="xd24e1797src">86</a> must have the same properties
as the Light, in his dominions, which on all sides were limited only by
the salt sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions,
and for beliefs good and bad, and the road to altercation was closed.
Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque, and Franks and Jews in one church,
and observed their own forms of worship. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par">He associated with the good of every race and creed and
persuasion, and was gracious to all in accordance with their condition
and understanding. He passed his nights in wakefulness, and slept
little in the day; the length of his sleep during a whole night and day
(<i>nycthemeron</i>) was not more than a watch and a half. He counted
his wakefulness at night as so much added to his life. His courage and
boldness were such that he could mount raging, rutting elephants, and
subdue to obedience murderous elephants which would not allow their own
females near them&mdash;although even when an elephant is bad-tempered
he does no harm to the female or his driver&mdash;and which were in a
state in which they might have killed their drivers or the females, or
not have allowed their approach. He would place himself on a wall or
tree near which an elephant was passing that had killed its mahout and
broken loose from restraint, and, putting his trust in God&rsquo;s
favour, would throw himself on its back and thus by merely mounting,
would bring it under control and tame it. This was repeatedly seen.</p>
<p class="par">He ascended the throne in his 14th year. Hem&#363;, the
infidel whom the Afghan ruler had raised to high station, collected a
wonderful force after King Hum&#257;y&#363;n&rsquo;s death with a stud
of elephants such as no ruler of Hindustan had at that time, and he
went towards Delhi. Hum&#257;y&#363;n had appointed Akbar to drive off
some of the Afghans from the foot-hills of the Panjab, but just then he
exemplified the hemistich which is a description of the accident and
the chronogram of his death&mdash;</p>

<p class="par">When Hem&#363; reached the neighbourhood of Delhi,

<p class="par">A second time, through the pride engendered in the mind
of this accursed infidel by his victory, he came out of Delhi with his
force and elephants and advanced, while the glorious standards of His
Majesty (Akbar) proceeded from Kal&#257;n&#363;r for the purpose of
driving him away. The armies of darkness and light met in the
neighbourhood of Panipat, and on Thursday, Muh&#803;arram 2nd, A.H. 964
(November 5th, 1556), a fight took place. In the army of Hem&#363; were
30,000 brave fighting horsemen, while the <i>g&#863;h&#257;z&#299;s</i>
of the victorious army were not more than 4,000 or 5,000. On that day
Hem&#363; was riding an elephant named Haw&#257;&#702;&#299;. Suddenly
an arrow struck the eye of that infidel and came out at the back of his
head. His army, on seeing this, took to flight. By chance
S&#863;h&#257;h Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n Mah&#803;ram with a few brave
men came up to the elephant on which was the wounded Hem&#363;, and
would have shot an arrow at the driver, but he cried &ldquo;Do not kill
me; Hem&#363; is on this elephant.&rdquo; A number of men immediately
conveyed Hem&#363; as he was to the king (Akbar). Bair&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n represented <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb40" href=
"#v1pb40" name="v1pb40">40</a>]</span>that it would be proper if the
king with his own hand should strike the infidel with a sword, so that
obtaining the reward of a g&#863;h&#257;z&#299; (warrior of the Faith)
he might use this title on the imperial farmans. The king answered,
&ldquo;I have cut him in pieces before this,&rdquo; and explained:
&ldquo;One day, in Kabul, I was copying a picture in presence of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja&#703;Abdu-&#7779;-&#7778;amad S&#863;h&#299;r&#299;n
Qalam, when a form appeared from my brush, the parts of which were
separate and divided from each other. One of those near asked,
&lsquo;Whose picture is this?&rsquo; It came to my tongue to say that
it was the likeness of Hem&#363;.&rdquo; Not defiling his hand with his
(Hem&#363;&rsquo;s) blood, he told one of his servants to cut off his
head. Those killed in the defeated army numbered 5,000 in addition to
those who fell in various places round about.</p>
<p class="par">Another of the well-known deeds of Akbar was the
victorious expedition against Gujarat, and his rapid march there, at
the time when M&#299;rz&#257; Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain,
Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain M&#299;rz&#257;, and S&#863;h&#257;h
M&#299;rz&#257; revolted from this State and went towards Gujarat, and
all the nobles of that province, combining with the turbulent of those
parts, besieged the fort of Ahmadabad in which was M&#299;rz&#257;
&#703;Az&#299;z Koka with the royal army. His Majesty, in consequence
of the distracted state of J&#299;j&#299; Ang&#257;, the mother of the
last-named M&#299;rz&#257;, started for Gujarat with a body of royal
troops without delay from the capital of Fath&#803;p&#363;r. Having
covered in the space of nine days the long road which it should take
two months to accomplish, sometimes on horseback, sometimes on a camel
or in a bullock-cart, he arrived at Sarn&#257;l.</p>
<p class="par">When, on 5th Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal, 980 (September
15th, 1572), he reached the neighbourhood of the enemy&rsquo;s camp, he
consulted with those who were loyal to him. Some said he should make a
night attack on the camp. His Majesty, however, said that a night
attack was the resort of the faint-hearted and the way of the
deceitful, and immediately gave orders to beat the drums and set the
horsemen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb41" href="#v1pb41" name=

(S&#257;barmat&#299;) was reached, he ordered his men to cross it in
order. Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain M&#299;rz&#257; was agitated by the
noise of the army of victory, and himself came forward to reconnoitre.
Subh&#803;&#257;n Qul&#299; Turk, also with a troop of brave men, went
to the river&rsquo;s bank to enquire into the enemy&rsquo;s position.
The M&#299;rz&#257; asked what troops these were. Subh&#803;&#257;n
Qul&#299; replied that they were of the army of King
Jal&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n Akbar. That ill-fated one would not believe
this, and said his spies had seen the king fourteen days before in
Fath&#803;p&#363;r, and that it was clear Subh&#803;&#257;n Qul&#299;
was lying. To this Subh&#803;&#257;n Qul&#299; rejoined, &ldquo;Nine
days ago the king with this expedition started from
Fath&#803;p&#363;r.&rdquo; &ldquo;How could elephants have
come?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1845src" href="#xd24e1845"

was there of elephants?&rdquo; answered Subh&#803;&#257;n Qul&#299;.
&ldquo;Young men and heroes who cleave rocks, and are better than
famous and raging elephants, have come; the difference between loyalty
and sedition will now become known.&rdquo; The M&#299;rz&#257;, after
this conversation, turned aside and began to marshal his troops. The
king waited until his advanced guard sent word that the enemy had put
on their armour. He then moved forward, and although he sent several
times to order the K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am to advance, the
latter stood still. It was said to Akbar that, as the enemy was in
force, it would be well to remain on his side of the river until the
army of Gujarat arrived from within the fort. His Majesty answered:
&ldquo;Always, and especially in this affair, I have put my trust in
God. If I had considered routine, I should not have come in this rapid
manner. Now that our foe is ready for the fight, we ought not to
delay.&rdquo; With these words, and with his innate reliance on God as
his shield, he put his horse into the river with a few chosen men whom
he had appointed to ride with him. Though it was not supposed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb42" href="#v1pb42" name=

had called for his helmet, but in the agitation of bringing it his
armour-bearer dropped the face-guard (<i>buffe</i>). His comrades did
not regard this as a good omen, but he said at once, &ldquo;It is an
excellent omen, for it has revealed my face.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"

arraying the army of Gujarat, he prepared to march. Meanwhile

issued from the fort the enemy had appeared from amongst the trees. The

off. Muh&#803;ammad Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n Turk and Tard&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n D&#299;w&#257;na came forward with a band of brave
followers, and after a little fighting turned rein. On this His Majesty
said to Bhagw&#257;n D&#257;s, &ldquo;The enemy are unnumbered and we
are few; we must attack with one face and one heart; for a clenched
fist is more useful than an open hand.&rdquo; With these words he drew
his sword, and with shout of <i>Allahu-akbar</i> and <i>Y&#257;
Mu&#703;&#299;n</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e1871src" href=

him.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The sense of the age evaporated with the
clamour,</p>
<p class="line">The ear of the heavens was split with the
shouts.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The royal right and left wings and a band of brave
men in the centre fought with valour. Stars
(<i>kaukab&#257;&#702;&#299;</i>), which are a kind of firework, were
lighted by the enemy; they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb43" href=
"#v1pb43" name="v1pb43">43</a>]</span>twisted about among the
thorn-bushes, and created such confusion that a noted elephant of the
enemy began to move and threw their troops into disarray. With this the
royal centre came up and dispersed Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain and his
force. M&#257;n Singh Darb&#257;r&#299; overcame his foe under the
king&rsquo;s eyes, and R&#257;gho D&#257;s Kachhw&#257;ha sacrificed
his life. Muh&#803;ammad Waf&#257;, who was of the house-born of the
State, behaving very bravely, fell wounded from his horse. By the
favour of the Creator who cherishes His servants, and simply through
the courage and good fortune of the exalted king, the enemy were
scattered and defeated. In gratitude for this great victory the king
turned his face in supplication to the throne of his merciful Maker,
and poured forth his thanks.</p>
<p class="par">One of the kal&#257;wants (musicians) represented to His
Majesty that Saif K&#863;h&#257;n Kokalt&#257;s&#863;h had offered the
coin of his life in loyalty to the State, and on enquiry it appeared
that when Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain M&#299;rz&#257; with some of his
riffraff was attacking the centre Saif K&#863;h&#257;n met him and
fighting valiantly became a martyr. The M&#299;rz&#257; himself was
wounded by the hands of the brave men of the main body. The
Kokalt&#257;s&#863;h mentioned is the elder brother of Zain
K&#863;h&#257;n Koka.</p>
<p class="par">A strange circumstance was this: on the day before the
battle, when the king was eating, he asked Haz&#257;ra, who was learned
in the science of looking at the shoulder-blades (a kind of
divination), to see on whose side the victory would be. Haz&#257;ra
said: &ldquo;The victory will be on your side, but one of the chiefs of
your army will become a martyr.&rdquo; Whereupon Saif K&#863;h&#257;n
Koka said &ldquo;Would that this blessing might fall to my
lot!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="par">In short, M&#299;rz&#257; Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain
turned his reins, but his horse&rsquo;s feet became entangled in the
thorn-brake and he fell. An ahadi of the king, Gad&#257; &#703;Al&#299;
by name, found him, and having mounted him before him on his horse took
him to the king. As two or three claimed a share in his capture, His
Majesty asked who had made him prisoner. &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s
salt,&rdquo; he answered. The king ordered his hands, that had been
fastened behind him, to be tied in front. Meanwhile he asked for water.
Farh&#803;at K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of the confidential slaves,
struck him on the head, but the king, disapproving of this, sent for
his private drinking water and satisfied his thirst. Up to this time
M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Az&#299;z Koka and the garrison of the fort had
not come out. After the capture of the M&#299;rz&#257;, His Majesty was
proceeding slowly towards Ahmadabad. He had delivered the
M&#299;rz&#257; to R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh R&#257;&#7789;hor, one of
the Rajput chiefs, to be put on an elephant and brought with him.
Meanwhile Ik&#863;htiy&#257;ru-l-mulk, who was one of the influential
Gujarati leaders, made his appearance with an army of nearly 5,000 men.
Complete confusion fell upon the royal troops. The king, as his natural
valour and lofty disposition required, ordered the drums to be beaten,
and Shaj&#257;&#702;at K&#863;h&#257;n, R&#257;ja Bhagw&#257;n
D&#257;s, and some others charged on in front to fight this force.
Fearing that the enemy might get possession of M&#299;rz&#257;
Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain, R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh&rsquo;s men, by
the advice and plan of the aforesaid Raja (Bhagw&#257;n D&#257;s), cut
off his head. My father did not want to kill him. The forces of
Ik&#863;htiy&#257;ru-l-mulk also were dispersed, and he was thrown from
his horse into the thorn thicket. Suhr&#257;b Beg Turkm&#257;n cut off
his head and brought it in. It was only by the grace and power of God
that such a victory was won by a small number of men.</p>
<p class="par">In the same way are beyond all reckoning the conquest of
the province of Bengal, the capture of well-known and celebrated forts
in Hindustan such as Chitor and Ran&#7789;ambhor, the subjection of the
province of Khandesh, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb45"
href="#v1pb45" name="v1pb45">45</a>]</span>taking of the fort of
&#256;s&#299;r and of other provinces which by the exertions of the
royal armies came into the possession of the servants of the State. If
these were related in detail it would be a long story.</p>
<p class="par">In the fight at Chitor, the king with his own hand
killed Jitmal, the leader of the men in the fort. He had no rival in
shooting with a gun, and with the one with which he killed Jitmal, and
which was called Sangr&#257;m, he killed some 3,000 or 4,000 birds and
beasts.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1911src" href="#xd24e1911" name=

sports I am most disposed to that with the gun, and in one day have
shot eighteen deer.</p>
<p class="par">Of the austerities practised by my revered father, one
was the not eating the flesh of animals. During three months of the
year he ate meat, and for the remaining nine contented himself with
&#7778;&#363;f&#299; food, and was no way pleased with the slaughter of
animals. On many days and in many months this was forbidden to the
people. The days and months on which he did not eat flesh are detailed
in the Akbarn&#257;ma.</p>
<p class="par">On the day I made I&#703;tim&#257;du-l-mulk diwan, I put
Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk in charge of the
<i>d&#299;w&#257;n&#299;-i-buy&#363;t&#257;t</i> (care of buildings).

<p class="par">On one of my accession days, a hundred of the
Akbar&#299; and Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; servants were promoted to
higher rank and jagirs. At the commencement of the Ramaz&#803;&#257;n
&#703;&#298;d, as it was the first after my accession, I came down to
the &#703;&#298;dg&#257;h from my auspicious throne. There was a great
crowd, and having performed the dues of thanksgiving and praise
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb46" href="#v1pb46" name=
"v1pb46">46</a>]</span>I returned to the palace, where according to the
verse &ldquo;From the table of kings favours come to beggars,&rdquo; I
commanded a sum of money to be spent in alms and charity. Some lakhs of
d&#257;ms of this were entrusted to D&#363;st Muh&#803;ammad
(afterwards K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n), who divided them amongst
faqirs and those who were in want, and a lakh of d&#257;ms each was
given to Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain Anj&#363; (the
lexicographer), M&#299;rz&#257; &#7778;adr Jah&#257;n, and M&#299;r
Muh&#803;ammad Riz&#803;&#257; Sabzaw&#257;r&#299; to dispose of in
charity in different quarters of the city. I sent 5,000 rupees to the
dervishes of S&#863;haik&#863;h Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain
J&#257;m&#299;, and gave directions that each day one of the officers
of the watch<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1937src" href="#xd24e1937"
name="xd24e1937src">95</a> should give 50,000 d&#257;ms to faqirs. I
sent a jewelled sword to the K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, and
promoted Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n Anj&#363; to the rank of 3,000. The
office of <i>&#7778;adr</i> was entrusted to M&#299;r&#257;n &#7778;adr
Jah&#257;n, and I ordered H&#803;&#257;j&#299; Koka, who was one of my
father&rsquo;s foster-sisters,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1946src"
href="#xd24e1946" name="xd24e1946src">96</a> to bring before me in the
palace such women as were worthy to be presented with land and money. I
promoted Z&#257;hid K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Muh&#803;ammad
&#7778;&#257;diq K&#863;h&#257;n, from the rank of 1,500 to that of
2,000.</p>
<p class="par">It had been the custom<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1951src" href="#xd24e1951" name="xd24e1951src">97</a> that when
the gift of an elephant or horse was made to anyone, the naqibs and the
Masters of the Horse (<i>M&#299;r &#256;k&#863;h&#363;r&#257;n</i>)
took from him a sum of money as <i>jilaw&#257;na</i> (bridle-money). I
gave orders that this money should be paid by the government, so that
people might be freed from the importunities and demands of that set of
men.</p>
<p class="par">At this time S&#257;lb&#257;han arrived from Burhanpur
and produced before me the horses and elephants of my deceased brother
D&#257;niy&#257;l. Of the elephants, one male named Mast <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb47" href="#v1pb47" name=
"v1pb47">47</a>]</span>Alast appeared to me the best, and I gave him
the name of N&#363;r Gaj. A wonderful thing showed itself in this
elephant; on the sides of his ears small lumps had grown about the size
of melons, and from them came fluid such as drops from an elephant in
the rutting season; moreover, the top of his forehead was more
prominent than in other elephants. It was a splendid and imposing
animal.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1964src" href="#xd24e1964" name=

<p class="par">I gave to my son K&#863;hurram
(S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n) a rosary of jewels, with the hope that he
might obtain fulfilment of all his desires, both in visible and in
spiritual things.</p>
<p class="par">As I had remitted in my dominions customs duties
amounting to krors, I abolished also all the transit dues
(<i>s&#257;&#702;ir-jih&#257;t</i>) in Kabul, which is one of the noted
towns on the road to Hindustan. These brought in 1 kror and 23 lakhs of
dams. From the provinces of Kabul and Qandahar large sums used to be
derived every year from customs (<i>zak&#257;&#702;t</i>), which were
in fact the chief revenue of those places. I remitted these ancient
dues, a proceeding that greatly benefited the people of Iran and
Turan.</p>
<p class="par">&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s jagir in the
subah of Bih&#257;r had been given to B&#257;z Bah&#257;dur; I
therefore ordered that a jagir in the Panjab should be given to him. As
it was represented to me that a large sum was in arrears in his jagir,
and now that the order for exchange had been given its collection would
be difficult, I directed that a lakh of rupees should be given to him
from the Treasury and the arrears recovered from B&#257;z Bah&#257;dur
for the royal revenues.</p>
<p class="par">I promoted S&#863;har&#299;f &#256;mul&#299; to the rank
of 2,500, original and increase. He is a pure-hearted, lively-spirited
man. Though he has no tincture of current sciences, lofty words and
exalted knowledge often manifest themselves in him. In the dress of a
faqir he made many journeys, and he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb48" href="#v1pb48" name="v1pb48">48</a>]</span>has friendship with
many saints and recites the maxims of those who profess mysticism. This
is his conversation, not his practice (<i>q&#257;li-&#363; ast na
h&#803;&#257;l&#299;</i>). In the time of my revered father he
relinquished the garments of poverty and asceticism, and attained to
amirship and chiefship. His utterance is exceedingly powerful, and his
conversation is remarkably eloquent and pure, although he is without
Arabic. His compositions also are not devoid of verve.<a class=

(March 11th or 12th, 1606), in the morning, which is the time of the
blessing of light, his Eminence the Great Luminary passed from the
constellation of the Fish to the House of Honour in the constellation
of the Ram. As this was the first New Year&rsquo;s Day after my
auspicious accession I ordered them to decorate the porticoes of the
private and public halls of the palace, as in the time of my revered
father, with delicate stuffs, and to adorn them handsomely. From the
first day of the Naur&#363;z to the 19th degree of the Ram (Aries),
which is the day of culmination, the people gave themselves over to
enjoyment and happiness. Players and singers of all bands and castes
were gathered together. Dancing lulis and charmers of India whose
caresses would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb49" href="#v1pb49"
name="v1pb49">49</a>]</span>captivate the hearts of angels kept up the
excitement of the assemblies. I gave orders that whoever might wish for
intoxicating drinks and exhilarating drugs should not be debarred from
using them.</p>

<p class="par first">In my father&rsquo;s time it had become
established that one of the great nobles should prepare an
entertainment on each of the 17 or 18 days of the festival, and should
present His Majesty the king with choice gifts of all kinds of jewels
and jewelled things, precious stuffs, and elephants and horses, and
should invite him to take the trouble to come to his assembly. By way
of exalting his servants, he would deign to be present, and having
looked at the presents would take what he approved of and bestow the
remainder on the giver of the entertainment. As my mind was inclined to
the comfort and ease of the army and subjects, I this year let them off
their gifts with the exception of a few from my immediate retainers,
which I accepted in order to gratify them. In those same days many
servants of the State obtained higher rank. Amongst them I raised
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n Afg&#863;h&#257;n to 1,500, and I raised
R&#257;ja B&#257;so, who was a landholder of the hill country of the
Panjab, and who from the time I was prince till now has kept the way of
service and sincerity towards me and held the rank of 1,500, to 3,500.
S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of Qandahar, I
promoted to 5,000, and R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh, a R&#257;jp&#363;t
noble, obtained the same rank. I gave 12,000 rupees for expenses to
R&#257;n&#257; S&#863;hankar.</p>
<p class="par">At the beginning of my reign, a son of that
Muz&#804;affar Gujar&#257;t&#299; who claimed to be descended from the
rulers of that country lifted up the head of disturbance and attacked
and plundered the environs of the city of Ahmadabad. <span class=

Bah&#257;dur &#362;zbeg and R&#257;y &#703;Al&#299; Bhat&#299;, who
were amongst the distinguished and brave men there, became martyrs in
that outbreak. At length R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t and many
mansabdars were provided by me with 6,000 or 7,000 horse, and appointed
to assist the army of Gujarat. It was decided that when things had
quieted down, by the driving off of those seditious people, R&#257;ja
Bikram&#257;j&#299;t should be Subahdar of Gujarat. Qil&#299;j
K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been previously nominated to this office,
should come to Court. After the arrival of the royal troops the thread
of the rebels&rsquo; union was severed; they took refuge in different
jungles, and the country was reduced to order. The news of this victory
reached the ear of my state and dignity in the most acceptable of hours
(New Year time).</p>
<p class="par">About this time there came a representation from my son
Parw&#299;z that the R&#257;n&#257; had left <i>th&#257;na</i> Mandal,

run away, and that a force had been appointed to pursue him; and that
it was to be hoped the good fortune of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r would cause
him to become non-existent.</p>
<p class="par">On the last day of the feast of the New Year, many
servants of the State were honoured with favours and increase of rank.
P&#299;s&#863;hrau K&#863;h&#257;n was an old retainer and had come
from Persia (<i>wil&#257;yat</i>) with Hum&#257;y&#363;n; indeed, he
was one of the men whom S&#863;h&#257;h Tahm&#257;sp had sent with

K&#863;husrau in consequence of his youth and the pride youths have,
and the lack of experience and the lack of foresight of worthless
companions, especially at the time of my revered father&rsquo;s
illness. Some of these short-sighted ones, through the multitude of
their crimes and offences, had become hopeless of pardon and
indulgence, and imagined that by making K&#863;husrau a tool they might
conduct the affairs of State through him. They overlooked the truth
that acts of sovereignty and world rule are not things to be arranged
by the worthless endeavours of defective intellects. The just Creator
bestows them on him whom he considers fit for this glorious and exalted

the throne of Allah. I invariably found K&#863;husrau preoccupied and
distracted. However much, in favour and affection for him, I wished to
drive from his mind some of his fears and alarms, nothing was gained
until, at last, by the advice of those whose fortune was reversed, on
the night of Sunday, Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja 8th, of the year
mentioned (April 6th, 1605), when two gharis had passed, he made a
pretence<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2080src" href="#xd24e2080" name=

(Akbar), and went off with 350 horsemen, who were his adherents, from
within the fort of Agra. Shortly after, one of the lamp attendants who
was acquainted with the Waz&#299;ru-l-mulk gave him the news of
K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s flight. The Vizier took him to the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257;, who, as the news seemed true, came in a
distracted state of mind to the door of the private apartments and said
to one of the eunuchs, &ldquo;Take in my request and say that I have a
necessary representation to make, and let the king honour me by coming
out.&rdquo; As such an affair had not entered my thoughts I supposed
that news had come from the Deccan or Gujarat. When I came out and
heard what the news was, I asked, &ldquo;What must be done? Shall I

Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; submitted that he would go if I ordered it.
&ldquo;Let it be so,&rdquo; I said. Afterwards he said, &ldquo;If he
will not turn back on my advice, and takes up arms, what must be
done?&rdquo; Then I said, &ldquo;If he will go in no way on the right
road, do not consider a crime anything that results from your action.
Kingship regards neither son nor son-in-law. No one is a relation to a
king.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When I had said these words and other things, and had
dismissed him, it occurred to me that K&#863;husrau was very much
annoyed with him, and that in consequence of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb53" href="#v1pb53" name=
"v1pb53">53</a>]</span>dignity and nearness (to me) which he (the
Am&#299;r) enjoyed, he was an object of envy to his equals and
contemporaries.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2087src" href="#xd24e2087"
name="xd24e2087src">107</a> Perhaps they might devise treachery and
destroy him. I therefore ordered Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk to recall him, and
selecting in his place S&#863;haik&#863;h Far&#299;d
Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;-beg&#299; commanded him to start off at once,
and to take with him the mansabdars and ahadis who were on guard.
Ihtim&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n the <i>kotw&#257;l</i> was made scout and
intelligence officer. I determined, God willing, to start off myself
when it was day. Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk brought back the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257;.</p>
<p class="par">About this time, Ah&#803;mad Beg K&#863;h&#257;n and
D&#363;st Muh&#803;ammad K&#863;h&#257;n had been sent off to
Kabul,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2095src" href="#xd24e2095" name=
"xd24e2095src">108</a> and had got as far as Sikandra, which was on
K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s route. On his arrival they came out of their
tents with some of their people, and returned and waited on me with the
news that K&#863;husrau had taken the Panjab road and was hastening on.
It occurred to me that he might change his route and go somewhere else.
As his maternal uncle, M&#257;n Singh, was in Bengal, it occurred to
many of the servants of the State that he might go in that direction. I
sent out on every side, and ascertained that he was making for the
Panjab. Meantime day dawned, and in reliance on the grace and favour of
God Almighty, and with clear resolve, I mounted, withheld by nothing
and no one.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;In truth, he who is pursued by sorrow.</p>

<p class="par">When I reached the venerable mausoleum of my revered
father, which is three kos from the city, I begged for aid to my
courage from the spirit of that honoured one. About this time they
captured and brought in<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2119src" href=
"#xd24e2119" name="xd24e2119src">109</a> M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;asan,
son of M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, who had proposed to
accompany K&#863;husrau. He could not deny it when I questioned him,
and I ordered them to tie his hands and mount him on an
elephant.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2122src" href="#xd24e2122" name=
"xd24e2122src">110</a> This was the first good omen manifested through
the kindness and blessing of that venerable one. At midday, as it had
become exceedingly hot, having rested awhile under the shade of a tree,
I said to the K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am that we, with all our
composure, were in such a state that we had not taken till now our
regular allowance of opium, which it was the practice to take the first
thing in the morning, and no one had reminded us of the omission. We
might imagine from this what was now the condition of that graceless
one (K&#863;husrau).<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2125src" href=
"#xd24e2125" name="xd24e2125src">111</a></p>
<p class="par">My trouble was this, that my son without any cause or
reason should become an opponent and an enemy. If I should make no
endeavour to capture him, the fractious or rebellious would have an
instrument, or else he would take his own way and go for an asylum to
the &#362;zbegs or the Persians, and contempt would fall upon my
government. On this account, having made a special point of capturing
him, I went on after a short rest two or three kos beyond pargana
Mathura, which is 20 kos from Agra, and I alighted at one of the
villages of that pargana where there is a tank.</p>
<p class="par">When K&#863;husrau arrived at Mathura, he met
H&#803;usain Beg Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;, who was of those who had
received favours from my revered father and was coming from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb55" href="#v1pb55" name=
"v1pb55">55</a>]</span>Kabul to wait on me. As it is the temperament of
the Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;s to be seditious and turbulent,
K&#863;husrau regarded<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2134src" href=
"#xd24e2134" name="xd24e2134src">112</a> this meeting as a godsend, and
made H&#803;usain Beg the captain and guide of 200 or 300 Badakhshan
Aim&#257;qs, who were with him.</p>
<p class="par">Anyone whom they met, they plundered of horses and
goods. Merchants and conveyers of goods were plundered by these
rascals, and wheresoever they went men&rsquo;s wives and children were
not safe from the calamity of these wretches. With his own eyes
K&#863;husrau was witnessing the oppression practised in the hereditary
dominions of his ancestors, and after being a witness of the improper
deeds of these rascals he a thousand times every moment wished death
for himself. Finally, he had no remedy but to temporize with and
support those dogs. If good luck and fortune had assisted him in his
affairs, he would have made repentance and regret his voucher, and come
without any deceit to wait on me. God, who knows the world of secrets,
knows that I should have passed over his offences entirely and shown
him such favour and affection that to the extent of a hair&rsquo;s
point no estrangement or fear would have remained upon his mind.
Inasmuch as during the lifetime of the late king (Akbar) an intention
of joining in the sedition of some of the rebels had manifested itself
in his mind, and he knew that this had come to my knowledge, he placed
no reliance on my kindness and affection. His mother, while I was
prince, in grief at his ways and behaviour and the misconduct of her
brother M&#257;dho Singh,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2140src" href=
"#xd24e2140" name="xd24e2140src">113</a> killed herself by swallowing
opium (<i>tiry&#257;q</i>).<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2146src" href=
"#xd24e2146" name="xd24e2146src">114</a> What shall I write of her
excellences and goodness? She had perfect intelligence, and her
devotion to me was such that she would have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb56" href="#v1pb56" name=
"v1pb56">56</a>]</span>sacrificed a thousand sons and brothers for one
hair of mine. She constantly wrote to K&#863;husrau and urged him to be
sincere and affectionate to me. When she saw that it was of no use and
that it was unknown how far he would be led away, she from the
indignation and high spirit which are inherent in the Rajput character
determined upon death. Her mind was several times disturbed, for such
feelings were hereditary, and her ancestors and her brothers had
occasionally showed signs of madness, but after a time had recovered.
At a time when I had gone hunting, on Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja 26th,
1013<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2154src" href="#xd24e2154" name=
"xd24e2154src">115</a> (May 6th, 1605), she in her agitation swallowed
a quantity of opium, and quickly passed away. It was as if she had
foreseen this behaviour of her unworthy son.</p>
<p class="par">My first marriage and that at the commencement of my
adolescence was with her. After K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s birth I gave her
the title of S&#863;h&#257;h Begam. When she could not endure the bad
conduct of her son and brother towards me she became disgusted with
life and died, thereby escaping the present grief and sorrow. In
consequence of her death, from the attachment I had for her, I passed
some days without any kind of pleasure in life or existence, and for
four days, which amount to 32 watches, I took nothing in the shape of
food or drink. When this tale was told to my revered father, a letter
of condolence of excessive kindness and affection reached this devoted
disciple, and he sent me a robe of honour and the auspicious turban
tied just as he had taken it off his head. This favour threw water on
the flame of my grief and afforded complete quiet and repose to my
unquietude and disturbance. My intention in relating these
circumstances is to point out that no evil fortune is greater than when
a son, through the impropriety <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb57"
href="#v1pb57" name="v1pb57">57</a>]</span>of his conduct and his
unapproved methods of behaviour, causes the death of his mother and
becomes contumacious and rebellious to his father, without cause or
reason, but simply through his own imaginations and futile ideas, and
chooses to avoid the blessing of waiting upon him. Inasmuch as the
Almighty Avenger lays a proper punishment on each action, of necessity
his condition finally came to this, that he was caught under the worst
circumstances, and falling from a position of trust became captive to
perpetual incarceration.</p>

<p class="par first">To sum up, on Tuesday, Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja

S&#863;haik&#863;h Far&#299;d Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; and a band of
valiant men were chosen to pursue K&#863;husrau and became the vanguard
of the victorious army. I sent back D&#363;st Muh&#803;ammad, who was
in attendance on me, on account of his previous service and his white
beard, to take charge of the fort of Agra and of the zan&#257;na and
the treasuries. When leaving Agra, I had placed the city in the charge
of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula and Waz&#299;ru-l-mulk. I now said to
D&#363;st Muh&#803;ammad, &ldquo;As we are going to the Panjab, and
that province is in the diwani of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula, you will

<p class="par">On Wednesday I alighted at Palwal, and on Thursday at
Far&#299;d&#257;b&#257;d; on Friday, the 13th, I reached Delhi.

hastened to the venerated tomb of Hum&#257;y&#363;n, and there besought
help in my purpose, and with my own hand distributed money to poor
persons and dervishes. Thence turning to the shrine of the venerable
saint S&#863;haik&#863;h Niz&#804;&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n Auliy&#257;, I
performed the dues of pilgrimage. After this I gave a portion<a class=

Anj&#363; and another portion to H&#803;ak&#299;m Muz&#804;affar that
they might divide it amongst the poor and dervishes. On Saturday the
14th I stayed in Sar&#257;y Narela.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2183src"
href="#xd24e2183" name="xd24e2183src">119</a> This rest-house
(<i>sar&#257;y</i>) K&#863;husrau had burned as he went.</p>
<p class="par">The rank of &#256;q&#257; Mull&#257;, brother of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been exalted by becoming my
servant, was fixed in original and increase at 1,000 with 300 horse. He
was in close attendance during this journey. Considering that some of
the Aim&#257;qs attached to the royal army were in league with
K&#863;husrau, and fearing that consequently some fraud or sedition
might enter their minds, 2,000 rupees were given to their leaders to
distribute amongst their men and make them hopeful of the
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; favour. I gave money to S&#863;haik&#863;h
Faz&#803;lu-llah and R&#257;ja Dh&#299;rdhar to distribute to faqirs
and brahmans on the road. I gave orders that to R&#257;n&#257;
S&#863;hankar in Ajmir should be given 30,000 rupees by way of
assistance for his expenditure.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 16th, I reached the pargana of

"#xd24e2193" name="xd24e2193src">120</a> This station and place used to
be very propitious to my gracious father and honoured ancestors, and
two great victories had been gained in it. One was the defeat of
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m Lod&#299;, which was won by the might of the
victorious hosts of His Majesty Fird&#363;s-mak&#257;n&#299;. The story
of this has been written in the histories of the time. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb59" href="#v1pb59" name=
"v1pb59">59</a>]</span>The second victory was over the wicked
Hem&#363;, and was manifested from the world of fortune in the
beginning of the reign of my revered father, as has been described by
me in detail.</p>
<p class="par">At the time that K&#863;husrau had left Delhi and was
proceeding to Panipat, it happened that Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n
had arrived there. When shortly before K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s arrival he
heard of this affair, he sent his children across the Jumna and bravely
determined to hasten on and throw himself into the fort of Lahore
before K&#863;husrau should arrive. About this time
&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m also reached Panipat from Lahore, and
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n suggested to him that he too should send
his children across the river, and should stand aside and await the
victorious standards of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r. As he was lethargic and
timid, he could not make up his mind to do this, and delayed so much
that K&#863;husrau arrived. He went out and waited on him, and either
voluntarily or in a state of agitation agreed to accompany him. He
obtained the title of Malik Anwar and the position of vizier.
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n, like a brave man, turned towards Lahore,
and on his road informed everyone and everybody of the servants of the
court and the <i>karoriy&#257;n</i>, and the merchants whom he came
across, of the exodus of K&#863;husrau. Some he took with him, and
others he told to stand aside out of the way. After that, the servants
of God were relieved of the plundering by robbers and oppressors. Most
probably, if Sayyid Kam&#257;l in Delhi, and Dil&#257;war
K&#863;h&#257;n at Panipat, had shown courage and determination, and
had blocked K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s path, his disorderly force would not
have been able to resist and would have scattered, and he himself would
have been captured. The fact is that their talents (<i>himmat</i>) were
not equal to this, but afterwards each made amends for his fault, viz.,
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n, by his rapid march, entered the fort of
Lahore before K&#863;husrau reached it, and by this notable service
made amends for his earlier shortcoming, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb60" href="#v1pb60" name="v1pb60">60</a>]</span>and Sayyid
Kam&#257;l manfully exerted himself in the engagement with
K&#863;husrau, as will be described in its own place.</p>
<p class="par">On Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja 17th the royal standards
were set up in the pargana of Karn&#257;l. Here I raised
&#703;&#256;bid&#299;n K&#863;hw&#257;ja, son of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Kal&#257;n J&#363;yb&#257;r&#299; and <i>p&#299;rz&#257;da</i>
(spiritual adviser), son of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n &#362;zbeg,
who had come in the time of my revered father, to the rank of 1,000.
S&#863;haik&#863;h Niz&#804;&#257;m Thaneswar&#299;, who was one of the
notorious impostors (<i>s&#863;hayy&#257;d&#257;n</i>) of the age,
waited on K&#863;husrau, and having gratified him with pleasant news,
again<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2216src" href="#xd24e2216" name=
"xd24e2216src">121</a> led him out of the (right) path, and then came
to wait on me. As I had heard of these transactions, I gave him his
road expenses and told him to depart for the auspicious place of
pilgrimage (Mecca). On the 19th the halt was in pargana
S&#863;h&#257;h&#257;b&#257;d. Here there was very little water, but it
happened that heavy rain fell, so that all were rejoiced.</p>
<p class="par">I promoted S&#863;haik&#863;h Ah&#803;mad

given to the disciple: he must not confuse or darken his years with
sectarian quarrels, but must follow the rule of universal peace with
regard to religions; he must not kill any living creature with his own

to be thrown under the feet of elephants, and three who denied were

N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299; the <i>kotw&#257;l</i> entered Lahore,

K&#863;h&#257;n arrived (there) with news that K&#863;husrau was moving
on Lahore and that they should be on their guard. On the same day the
city gates were guarded and strengthened, and two days later
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n entered the fort with a few men and began
to strengthen the towers and walls. Wherever these were broken and
thrown down he repaired them, and, placing cannon and swivel guns on
the citadel, he prepared for battle. Assembling the small number of the
royal servants who were in the fort, they were assigned their several
duties, and the people of the city also with loyalty gave their
assistance. Two days later, and when all was ready, K&#863;husrau
arrived, and, having fixed a place for his camp, gave orders to
invest<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2301src" href="#xd24e2301" name=
"xd24e2301src">128</a> the city and to prepare for battle, and to burn
one of the gates on any side where one could be got at. &ldquo;After
taking the fort,&rdquo; he said to his wicked crew, &ldquo;I will give
orders to plunder the city for seven days and to make captive the women
and children.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This doomed lot set fire to a gate, and Dil&#257;war Beg

those appointed to Kashmir and was now encamped on the Chen&#257;b,
having heard the news, started rapidly for Lahore. When he reached the
Ravi he sent word to the garrison of the fort that he came with a loyal
intention and that they should admit him. They sent someone at night
and conducted him and some of his men inside. When the siege had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb63" href="#v1pb63" name=

royal army came repeatedly to K&#863;husrau and his adherents. They
became helpless (<i>b&#299; p&#257;</i>), and made up their minds that
they must face the victorious army.</p>
<p class="par">As Lahore is one of the greatest places in Hindustan, a
great number of people gathered in six or seven days. It was reported
on good authority that 10,000 or 12,000 horse were collected, and had
left the city with the view of making a night attack on the royal
vanguard. This news was brought to me at the <i>sar&#257;y</i> of
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; &#703;Al&#299; on the night of Thursday the 16th.
Although it rained heavily in the night I beat the drum of march and
mounted. Arriving in Sult&#804;&#257;np&#363;r at dawn I remained there
till noon. By chance, at this place and hour the victorious army
encountered that ill-fated band. Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk had brought a dish
of roast meat,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2324src" href="#xd24e2324"
name="xd24e2324src">129</a> and I was turning towards it with zest when
the news of the battle was brought to me. Though I had a longing to eat
the roast meat, I immediately took a mouthful by way of augury and
mounted, and without waiting for the coming up of men and without
regard to the smallness of my force I went off in all haste. However
much I demanded my <i>chiltah</i> (wadded coat), they did not produce
it. My only arms were a spear and sword, but I committed myself to the
favour of God and started off without hesitation. At first my escort
did not number more than fifty horsemen; no one had expected a fight
that day. In fine, when I reached the head of the bridge of
Gobindw&#257;l,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2332src" href="#xd24e2332"
name="xd24e2332src">130</a> 400 or 500 horse, good and bad, had come
together. When I had crossed the bridge the news of a victory was
brought to me. The bearer of the good news was S&#863;hams&#299;,
<i>t&#363;s&#863;hakch&#299;</i> (wardrobe man), and for his good news
he obtained the title of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb64" href=
"#v1pb64" name=
"v1pb64">64</a>]</span>K&#863;h&#363;s&#863;h-k&#863;habar
K&#863;h&#257;n. M&#299;r Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain, whom I
had sent previously to advise K&#863;husrau, came up at the same time
and said such things about the number and bravery of
K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s men as frightened his hearers. Though news of the
victory came continuously, this simple-minded Sayyid would not believe
it, and expressed incredulity that such an army as he had seen could be
defeated by S&#863;haik&#863;h Far&#299;d&rsquo;s force, which was
small and not properly equipped. When they brought
K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s litter<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2341src" href=
"#xd24e2341" name="xd24e2341src">131</a> with two of his eunuchs, the
M&#299;r admitted what had happened. Then, alighting from his horse, he
placed his head at my feet and professed every kind of humility and
submission, and said that there could be no higher or more lofty
fortune than this.</p>
<p class="par">In this command S&#863;haik&#863;h Far&#299;d behaved
with sincerity and devotion. The Sayyids of B&#257;rha, who are of the
brave ones of the age, and who have held this place in every fight in
which they have been, formed the van. Saif K&#863;h&#257;n, son of
Sayyid Mah&#803;m&#363;d K&#863;h&#257;n B&#257;rha, the head of the
tribe, had shown great bravery and had received seventeen wounds.
Sayyid Jal&#257;l, also of the brethren of this band, received an arrow
in his temple and died a few days later. At the time when the Sayyids
of B&#257;rha, who were not more than fifty or sixty in number, having
received wounds from 1,500 Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; horsemen, had
been cut to pieces, Sayyid Kam&#257;l, who, with his brothers, had been
appointed to support the van, came up on the flank and fought with
wondrous bravery and manliness. After that the men of the right wing
raised the cry of <i>P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h sal&#257;mat</i>
(&ldquo;Long live the King&rdquo;) and charged, and the rebels hearing
the words, gave up and scattered abroad to various hiding-places. About
400 Aim&#257;qs became crushed on the plain of anger and overcome by
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb65" href="#v1pb65" name=
"v1pb65">65</a>]</span>victorious army. K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s box of
jewels and precious things which he had always with him, fell into our
hands.</p>

<p class="par first">Short-sighted men in Allahabad had urged me also
to rebel against my father. Their words were extremely unacceptable and
disapproved by me. I know what sort of endurance a kingdom would have,
the foundations of which were laid on hostility to a father, and was
not moved by the evil counsels of such worthless men, but acting
according to the dictates of reason and knowledge I waited on my
father, my guide, my <i>qibla</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2393src"
href="#xd24e2393" name="xd24e2393src">133</a> and my visible God, and
as a result of this good purpose it went well with me.</p>
<p class="par">In the evening of the day of K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s
flight I gave R&#257;ja B&#257;so, who is a trusty zamindar of the
hill-country of Lahore, leave to go to that frontier, and, wherever he
heard news or trace of K&#863;husrau, to make every effort to capture
him. I also appointed Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n and M&#299;rz&#257;
&#703;Al&#299; Akbars&#863;h&#257;h&#299; to a large force, which was
to pursue K&#863;husrau in whatever direction he might go. I resolved
with myself that if K&#863;husrau went to Kabul, I would follow him and
not turn back till he was captured. If not delaying in Kabul he should
go on to Badakhshan and those regions, I would leave Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n in Kabul and return myself (to India). My reason for
not going to Badakhshan was that that wretch would (in that case)
certainly ally himself with the &#362;zbegs, and the disgrace would
attach to this State. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb66" href=
"#v1pb66" name="v1pb66">66</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">On the day on which the royal troops were ordered to
pursue K&#863;husrau, 15,000 rupees were given to Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n and 20,000 to the ahadis, and 10,000 more were sent
with the army to be given to whom it might be necessary to give it on
the way.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 28th, the victorious camp was pitched
at Jaip&#257;l,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2404src" href="#xd24e2404"
name="xd24e2404src">134</a> which lies seven kos from Lahore. On the
same day K&#863;husrau arrived with a few men on the bank of the
Chen&#257;b. The brief account of what had happened is that after his
defeat those who had escaped with him from the battle became divided in
opinion. The Afghans and Indians, who were mostly his old retainers,
wished to double back like foxes into Hindustan, and to become a source
of rebellion and trouble there. H&#803;usain Beg, whose people and
family and treasure were in the direction of Kabul, suggested going to
Kabul. In the end, as action was taken according to the wish of
H&#803;usain Beg, the Hindustanis and the Afghans decided to separate
themselves from him. On arriving at the Chen&#257;b, he proposed to
cross at the ferry of S&#863;h&#257;hp&#363;r, which is one of the
recognized crossings, but as he could find no boats there he made for
the ferry of Sodharah, where his people got one boat without boatmen
and another full of firewood and grass.</p>
<p class="par">The ferries over the rivers had been stopped because
before K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s defeat orders had been given to all the
jagirdars and the superintendents of roads and crossings in the subah
of the Panjab that as this kind of dispute had arisen they must all be
on the alert. H&#803;usain Beg wished to transfer the men from the boat
with firewood and grass to the other, so that they might convey
K&#863;husrau across. At this juncture arrived K&#299;lan,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e2409src" href="#xd24e2409" name=
"xd24e2409src">135</a> son-in-law of Kam&#257;l <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb67" href="#v1pb67" name=
"v1pb67">67</a>]</span>Chaudhar&#299; of Sodharah, and saw a body of
men about to cross in the night. He cried out to the boatmen that there
was an order from the king Jah&#257;ng&#299;r forbidding unknown men
from crossing in the night, and that they must be careful. Owing to the
noise and uproar, the people of the neighbourhood gathered together,
and Kam&#257;l&rsquo;s son-in-law took from the boatmen the pole with
which they propel the boat, and which in Hindustani is called
<i>ball&#299;</i>, and thus made the boat unmanageable. Although money
was offered to the boatmen, not one would ferry them over. News went to
Ab&#363;-l-Q&#257;sim Namak&#299;n, who was at Gujarat, near the
Chen&#257;b, that a body of men were wanting to cross the river by
night, and he at once came to the ferry in the night with his sons and
some horsemen. Things went to such a length that H&#803;usain Beg shot
arrows at the boatmen,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2417src" href=
"#xd24e2417" name="xd24e2417src">136</a> and Kam&#257;l&rsquo;s
son-in-law also took to shooting arrows from the river-bank. For four
kos the boat took its own way down the river, until at the end of the
night it grounded, and try as they would they could not get it off.
Meantime it became day. Ab&#363;-l-Q&#257;sim and K&#863;hw&#257;ja
K&#863;hiz&#803;r K&#863;h&#257;n, who by the efforts of Hil&#257;l
K&#863;h&#257;n had assembled on this (? the west) side of the river,
fortified its west bank, and the zamindars fortified it on the
east.</p>
<p class="par">Before this affair of K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s, I had sent
Hil&#257;l K&#863;h&#257;n as <i>saz&#257;wal</i> to the army appointed
for Kashm&#299;r under Sa&#703;&#299;d K&#863;h&#257;n, and by chance
he arrived in the neighbourhood (of the ferry) that same night; he came
in the nick of time, and his efforts had great effect in bringing
together Ab&#363;-l-Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n Namak&#299;n, and
K&#863;hw&#257;ja K&#863;hiz&#803;r K&#863;h&#257;n in the capture of
K&#863;husrau.</p>
<p class="par">On the morning of Sunday, the 24th of the aforesaid
month, people on elephants and in boats captured K&#863;husrau, and on
Monday, the last day of the month, news of this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb68" href="#v1pb68" name=
"v1pb68">68</a>]</span>reached me in the garden of M&#299;rz&#257;
K&#257;mr&#257;n. I immediately ordered the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; to
go to Gujarat and to bring K&#863;husrau to wait on me.</p>
<p class="par">In counsels on State affairs and government it often
happens that I act according to my own judgment and prefer my own
counsel to that of others. In the first instance I had elected to wait
on my revered father from Allahabad in opposition to the advice of my
faithful servants, and I obtained the blessing of serving him, and this
was for my spiritual and temporal good. By the same course of conduct I
had become king. The second instance was the pursuit of K&#863;husrau,
from which I was not held back by taking time to ascertain the
(auspicious) hour, etc., and from which I took no rest until I captured
him. It is a strange thing that after I had started I asked
H&#803;ak&#299;m &#703;Al&#299;, who is learned in mathematics, how the
hour of my departure had been (i.e. whether propitious or not), and he
replied that in order to obtain my object if I had wished to select an
hour, there could not have been for years one selected better than that
in which I mounted.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, Muh&#803;arram 3rd, 1015, in
M&#299;rz&#257; K&#257;mr&#257;n&rsquo;s garden, they brought
K&#863;husrau before me with his hands tied and chains on his legs from
the left side<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2436src" href="#xd24e2436"
name="xd24e2436src">137</a> after the manner and custom of Ching&#299;z
K&#863;h&#257;n. They made H&#803;usain Beg stand on his right hand and
&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m on his left. K&#863;husrau stood weeping
and trembling between them. H&#803;usain Beg, with the idea that it
might profit him, began to speak wildly. When his purport became
apparent to me I did not allow him to continue talking, but handed over
K&#863;husrau in chains, and ordered these two villains to be put in
the skins of an ox and an ass, and that they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb69" href="#v1pb69" name=
"v1pb69">69</a>]</span>should be mounted on asses with their faces to
the tail<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2441src" href="#xd24e2441" name=
"xd24e2441src">138</a> and thus taken round the city. As the ox-hide
dried more quickly than that of the ass, H&#803;usain Beg remained
alive for four watches and died from suffocation.
&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m, who was in the ass&rsquo;s skin and to
whom they gave some refreshment from outside, remained alive.</p>
<p class="par">From Monday, the last day of
Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja, until the 9th of Muh&#803;arram of the
aforesaid year, I remained in M&#299;rz&#257; K&#257;mr&#257;n&rsquo;s
garden because the time was unpropitious.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2446src" href="#xd24e2446" name="xd24e2446src">139</a> I bestowed
Bhairawal,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2449src" href="#xd24e2449" name=
"xd24e2449src">140</a> where the battle had taken place, on
S&#863;haik&#863;h Far&#299;d, and rewarded him with the high title of
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n. For the sake of good government I
ordered posts to be set up on both sides of the road from the garden to
the city, and ordered them to hang up and impale the seditious
Aim&#257;qs and others who had taken part in the rebellion. Thus each
one of them received an extraordinary punishment. I gave headship to
those landholders who had shown loyalty, and to every one of the
Chaudhar&#299;s between the Jhelam and the Chen&#257;b I gave lands for
their support.</p>
<p class="par">Of H&#803;usain Beg&rsquo;s property there were obtained
from the house of M&#299;r Muh&#803;ammad B&#257;q&#299; nearly seven
lakhs of rupees. This was exclusive of what he had made over to other
places and of what he had with him. After this, whenever his name is
mentioned, the words<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2454src" href=
"#xd24e2454" name="xd24e2454src">141</a> <i>g&#257;w&#257;n u
k&#863;har&#257;n</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb70" href=
"#v1pb70" name="v1pb70">70</a>]</span>(bullocks and asses) will be
used. When he came to this Court in company with M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h he had one horse. By degrees his affairs
flourished so that he became possessed of treasure both visible and
buried, and projects of this kind entered his mind.</p>
<p class="par">While K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s affair was still in the will
of God, as there was no actual governor between Afghanistan and Agra,
which is a source of sedition and mischief, and, fearing that
K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s affair might be prolonged, I ordered my son
Parw&#299;z to leave some of the sardars to look after the
R&#257;n&#257; and to come to Agra with &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n
and a body of those nearly connected with him in the service. He was to
consider the protection and management of that region his special
charge. But by the blessed favour of Allah, K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s
affair was settled before Parw&#299;z arrived in Agra; I accordingly
ordered my aforesaid son to come and wait on me.</p>
<p class="par">On Wednesday, Muh&#803;arram 8th, I auspiciously entered
the fort of Lahore. A number of loyalists represented to me that my
return to Agra would be for the good of the State at this time when
much was going amiss in Gujarat, in the Deccan, and in Bengal. This
counsel did not meet with my approval, for the reports of
S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of Qandahar, showed
that the officers of the Persian border were meditating an attack on
that fortress. They had been moved thereto by the machinations of the
residuum of the Mirzas of Qandahar&rsquo;s army, which was always
shaking the chain of contention. The Persian officers had written
letters to these malcontents, and there was likelihood of a
disturbance. It occurred to me that the death of His Majesty Akbar and
the unreasonable outbreak of K&#863;husrau might put an edge on their
design, and that they might attack Qandahar. What had occurred to my
mind became a realized fact. The governor of Far&#257;h<span class=
"corr" id="xd24e2473" title="Source: .">,</span> the Malik of
S&#299;stan, and the jagirdars of that neighbourhood, with the
assistance of H&#803;usain K&#863;h&#257;n, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb71" href="#v1pb71" name=
"v1pb71">71</a>]</span>governor of Herat, invaded Qandahar. Praise is
due to the manliness and courage of S&#863;h&#257;h Beg
K&#863;h&#257;n, who planted his foot firmly like a man, and
strengthened the fort, and seated himself on the top of the third(?)
citadel of the aforesaid fort in such a manner that outsiders could see
his entertainments. During the siege he girded not his loins, but with
bare head and feet arranged parties of pleasure; yet no day passed that
he did not send a force from the fort to meet the foe and did not make
manly efforts. This went on as long as he was in the fort. The
Qizilb&#257;s&#863;h army had invested on three sides. When news of
this reached Lahore it was clearly advisable to remain in that
neighbourhood. A large force was immediately appointed under the
leadership of M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;, who was
accompanied by a number of men of rank and servants of the Court, such
as Qar&#257; Beg and Tuk&#863;hta Beg, who had been promoted with the
titles of Qar&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n and Sard&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n. I
appointed M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; to a mansab of 5,000
personal, and horsemen, and bestowed drums on him. M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;zi was the son of M&#299;rz&#257; J&#257;n&#299;
Tark&#863;h&#257;n, king of Thathah (Sind), and by the efforts of
&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n
that country had been conquered in the reign of the late king. The
country of Thathah was included in his jagir, and he held the rank with
personality and horsemen of 5,000. After his death his son
M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;zi was raised to his rank and service.
Their ancestors were among the amirs of Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain
<span class="corr" id="xd24e2478" title=
"Source: Mirza">M&#299;rz&#257;</span> B&#257;y-qar&#257;, the ruler of
Khurasan, and they were originally descended from the amirs of
T&#299;m&#363;r (<i>&#7778;&#257;h&#803;ib-qir&#257;n&#299;</i>).
K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;&#256;qil was appointed bakhshi of this army;
43,000 rupees were given to Qar&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n for road
expenses, and 15,000 to Naqd&#299; Beg and Qil&#299;j Beg, who were to
accompany M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;. I determined to stay
at Lahore in order to settle this matter and with the intention of a
tour to Kabul. About this time the rank of H&#803;ak&#299;m
Fath&#803;u-llah was fixed, original and increased, at 1,000
personality and 300 horse. As S&#863;haik&#863;h H&#803;usain
J&#257;m&#299; had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb72" href="#v1pb72"
name="v1pb72">72</a>]</span>had dreams about me which had come true, I
gave him twenty lakhs of dams, equivalent to 30,000 or 40,000 rupees,
for the expenses of himself and his monastery and the dervishes who
were with him. On the 22nd I promoted &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
to the rank of 2,500 personal and 500 horse, original and increased. I
ordered to be given to the ahadis two lakhs of rupees to be paid in
advance and deducted by degrees from their monthly pay. I bestowed
6,000 rupees on Q&#257;sim Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, the son-in-law of
S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, and 3,000 rupees on Sayyid
Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">In Gobindw&#257;l, which is on the river B&#299;y&#257;h
(Beas), there was a Hindu named Arjun,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2488src" href="#xd24e2488" name="xd24e2488src">142</a> in the
garments of sainthood and sanctity, so much so that he had captured
many of the simple-hearted of the Hindus, and even of the ignorant and
foolish followers of Islam, by his ways and manners, and they had
loudly sounded the drum of his holiness. They called him
<i>G&#363;r&#363;</i>, and from all sides stupid people crowded to
worship and manifest complete faith in him. For three or four
generations (of spiritual successors) they had kept this shop warm.
Many times it occurred to me to put a stop to this vain affair or to
bring him into the assembly of the people of Islam.</p>
<p class="par">At last when K&#863;husrau passed along this road this
insignificant fellow proposed to wait upon him. K&#863;husrau happened
to halt at the place where he was, and he came out and did homage to
him. He behaved to K&#863;husrau in certain special ways, and made on
his forehead a finger-mark in saffron, which the Indians
(Hinduw&#257;n) call <i>qas&#863;hqa</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2499src" href="#xd24e2499" name="xd24e2499src">143</a> and is
considered propitious. When this came to my ears and I clearly
understood his folly, I ordered them <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb73" href="#v1pb73" name="v1pb73">73</a>]</span>to produce him and
handed over his houses, dwelling-places, and children to
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, and having confiscated his property
commanded that he should be put to death.</p>
<p class="par">There were two men named R&#257;j&#363; and Amb&#257;,
who, under the shadow of the protection of the eunuch Daulat
K&#863;h&#257;n, made their livelihood by oppression and tyranny, and
had done many acts of oppression in the few days that K&#863;husrau was
before Lahore. I ordered R&#257;j&#363; to the gallows and a fine to be
taken from Amb&#257;, who was reputed to be wealthy. In short, 15,000
rupees were collected from him, which sum I ordered them to expend on
<i>bulg&#863;hur-k&#863;h&#257;nas</i> (refectories) and in
charity.</p>
<p class="par">Sa&#703;du-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Sa&#703;d
K&#863;h&#257;n, was promoted to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,000
horse.</p>
<p class="par">In his great desire to wait upon me, Parw&#299;z
traversed long distances in a short time, in the rainy season and
incessant rain, and on Thursday, the 29th, when two watches and three
<i>gha&#7771;&#299;</i> of day had passed, obtained the blessing of
seeing me. With exceeding kindness and affection, I took him into the
embrace of favour and kissed his forehead.</p>
<p class="par">When this disgraceful conduct showed itself in
K&#863;husrau, I had resolved not to delay in any place till I had
captured him. There was a probability that he might turn back towards
Hindustan, so it appeared impolitic to leave Agra empty, as it was the
centre of the State, the abode of the ladies of the holy harem, and the
depository of the world&rsquo;s treasures. On these accounts I had
written when leaving Agra to Parw&#299;z, saying that his loyalty had
had this result, that K&#863;husrau had fled and that Fortune had
turned her face toward himself; that I had started in pursuit of
K&#863;husrau, and that he should consequently dispose of the affairs
of the R&#257;n&#257; in some way according to the necessity of the
time, and for the benefit of the kingdom should himself come quickly to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb74" href="#v1pb74" name=

capital and treasury, which was equal to the wealth of
Q&#257;r&#363;n,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2526src" href="#xd24e2526"
name="xd24e2526src">144</a> and I had commended him to the God of
power. Before this letter reached Parw&#299;z, the R&#257;n&#257; had
been so humbled that he had sent to &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n to
say that as by his own acts he had come to shame and disgrace, he hoped
that he would intercede for him in such a way that the prince would be
content with his sending B&#257;gha,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2529src" href="#xd24e2529" name="xd24e2529src">145</a> who was
one of his sons. Parw&#299;z had not agreed to this, and said that
either the R&#257;n&#257; himself should come or that he should send
Karan. Meantime the news of K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s disturbance arrived,
and on its account &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n and other loyalists
agreed to the coming of B&#257;gha, who obtained the blessing of
waiting on the prince near Man&#7693;alga&#7771;h.</p>
<p class="par">Parw&#299;z, leaving R&#257;ja Jagann&#257;th and most
of the chiefs of his army, started for Agra with &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n and some of those near to him and his own attendants,
and with him brought B&#257;gha to the Court. When he came near Agra he
heard the news of the victory over K&#863;husrau and his capture, and
after resting two days an order reached him that as matters appeared
settled in all quarters he should betake himself to me, in order that
on the prescribed date he might obtain the good fortune of waiting on
me. I bestowed on him the parasol
(<i>&#257;ft&#257;b-g&#299;r</i>),<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2537src"
href="#xd24e2537" name="xd24e2537src">146</a> which is one of the signs
of royalty, and I gave him the rank of 10,000 and sent an order to the
officials to grant him a <i>tank&#863;hw&#257;h</i> jagir. At this time
I sent M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Al&#299; Beg to Kashmir; 10,000 rupees
were delivered to Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; &#703;Izzatu-llah to divide
amongst faqirs and the poor of Kabul. Ah&#803;mad Beg K&#863;h&#257;n
was promoted to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,250 horse, original
and extra. At the same time Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been sent
to Burhanpur to bring the children of D&#257;niy&#257;l, returned after
an absence of 6 months <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb75" href=

<p class="par">In the whole of the hereditary dominions, both the crown
lands and the jagirs, I ordered the preparation of
<i>bulg&#863;hur-k&#863;h&#257;nas</i> (free eating-houses), where

selected for the rank of 1,000 personal and 300 horse. On Monday,
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-&#257;k&#863;hir 9th, I gave Parw&#299;z a special

Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n Koka and the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257;. I saw D&#257;niy&#257;l&rsquo;s children, whom
Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n had brought; there were three sons and four

Such kindness and affection were shown by me to these children as no
one thought possible. I resolved that T&#804;ahm&#363;ras&#804;, who
was the eldest, should always be in waiting on me, and the others were
handed over to the charge of my own sisters.</p>
<p class="par">A special dress of honour was sent to R&#257;ja M&#257;n
Singh in Bengal. I ordered a reward of 30 lakhs of dams to
M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;zi. I bestowed on S&#863;haik&#863;h

dignified him with the title of Kis&#863;hwar K&#863;h&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">As when I started in pursuit of K&#863;husrau I had left
my son K&#863;hurram in charge of the palaces and treasury, I now, when
that affair had been settled, ordered the said son to attend upon
Haz&#803;rat Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299; and the other ladies, and to
escort them to me. When they reached the neighbourhood of Lahore, on
Friday the 12th of the month mentioned, I embarked in a boat and went
to a village named Dahr to meet my mother, and I had the good fortune
to be received by her. After the performance of obeisance and
prostration and greeting which is due from the young to the old
according to the custom of Ching&#299;z, the rules of T&#299;m&#363;r
and common usage, and after worship of the King of the World (God), and
after finishing this business, I obtained leave to return, and
re-entered the fort of Lahore.</p>
<p class="par">On the 17th, having appointed Mu&#703;izzu-l&#772;-mulk
bakhshi of the army against the R&#257;n&#257;, I dismissed him to it.
As news had come of the rebellion of R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh and his
son, Dul&#299;p, in the neighbourhood of N&#257;gor, I ordered
R&#257;ja Jagann&#257;th to proceed against them with others of the
servants of the State and Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk, and to put a stop to
this disturbance. I gave 50,000 rupees to Sard&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n,
who had been appointed to the place of S&#863;h&#257;h Beg
K&#863;h&#257;n as Governor of Qandahar, and I promoted him to the rank
of 3,000 personal and 2,500 horse. To K&#863;hiz&#803;r

2,500 personal and 1,500 horse. I gave him also one of my own horses. I
sent robes of honour to eight individuals amongst the nobles of the
army of the Deccan.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2589src" href=
"#xd24e2589" name="xd24e2589src">151</a> Five thousand rupees were

<i>wak&#299;l</i> of M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Al&#299; Beg, the governor
of that place, to send to Srinagar. I presented a jewelled dagger of
the value of 6,000 rupees to Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n
K&#863;h&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">News reached me that S&#863;haik&#863;h
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m B&#257;b&#257;, the Afghan, had opened a religious
establishment (lit. one of being a shaikh and having disciples) in one
of the parganas<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2600src" href="#xd24e2600"
name="xd24e2600src">152</a> of Lahore, and as his doings were
disreputable and foolish a considerable number of Afghans had collected
round him. I ordered him to be brought and handed over to Parw&#299;z
to be kept in the fort of Chunar; so this vain disturbance was put an
end to.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, 7th Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal, many of the
mansabdars and ahadis were promoted: Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n
obtained the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,300 horse, Dil&#257;war
K&#863;h&#257;n 2,000 personal and 1,400 horse, Waz&#299;ru-l-mulk
1,300 personal and 550 horse, Qayy&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n 1,000
personal and horse, S&#863;hy&#257;m Singh 1,500 personal and 1,200
horse; in the same way forty-two mansabdars were promoted. On most days
the same observances occur. I presented Parw&#299;z with a ruby of the
value of 25,000 rupees. On Wednesday the 9th of the aforesaid month,
the 21st of S&#863;hahr&#299;war,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2605src"
href="#xd24e2605" name="xd24e2605src">153</a> after three watches and
four gharis, the feast for my solar weighing, which is the commencement
of the 38th year of my age, took place. According to custom they got
ready <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb78" href="#v1pb78" name=
"v1pb78">78</a>]</span>the weighing apparatus and the scales in the
house of Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299; (his mother). At the moment appointed
blessings were invoked and I sate in the scales. Each suspending rope
was held by an elderly person who offered up prayers. The first time
the weight in gold came to three Hindustani maunds and ten seers. After
this I was weighed against several metals, perfumes, and essences, up
to twelve weighings, the details of which will be given hereafter.
Twice a year I weigh myself against gold and silver and other metals,
and against all sorts of silks and cloths, and various grains, etc.,
once at the beginning of the solar year and once at that of the lunar.
The weight of the money of the two weighings I hand over to the
different treasurers for faqirs and those in want. On the same
auspicious day I promoted Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n Koka,
who for many years had expected such a day,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2610src" href="#xd24e2610" name="xd24e2610src">154</a> with
various favours. First, I gave him the rank of 5,000 personal and
horse, and with this a special robe of honour, a jewelled sword, and
one of my own horses, with a jewelled saddle, and I gave him leave to
go to the subahdarship of the province of Bengal and Orissa, which is a
place for 50,000 horse. As a mark of honour he set off accompanied by a
large force, and two lakhs of rupees were given him as a sumptuary
allowance. My connection with his mother is such that as in my
childhood I was under her guardianship and care, I have not so much
affection for my own mother as for her. She is to me my gracious
mother, and I do not hold him less dear than my own brothers and
children. Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n is the foster-brother who is most fit
for fosterage. I gave 300,000 rupees to his auxiliaries. On this day I
sent 130,000 as a marriage present (<i>s&#257;chiq</i>) for the
daughter of Pah&#257;r&#299; (his brother Mur&#257;d), who had been
betrothed to Parw&#299;z. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb79" href=

<p class="par">On the 22nd, B&#257;z Bah&#257;dur Qalm&#257;q, who had
long been guilty of evil practices in Bengal, by the guidance of
fortune obtained the honour of kissing my threshold. I gave him a
jewelled dagger, 8,000 rupees, and promoted him to the rank of 1,000
personal and horse. One lakh of rupees and cash and jewels were
bestowed on Parw&#299;z. Kesho D&#257;s M&#257;r&#363; was promoted to
the grade of 1,500 personal and horse. Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan, who had
been the diwan and factotum of my brother D&#257;niy&#257;l, together
with his children,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2619src" href=

government of Delhi. On the 21st of the same month I presented
Parw&#299;z with a necklace composed of four rubies and one hundred
pearls. The rank of H&#803;ak&#299;m Muz&#804;affar was fixed at 3,000
personal and 1,000 horse, original and extra. I gave 5,000 rupees to
Nathu M&#257;l (?), R&#257;ja of Manjholi.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">A remarkable occurrence was the discovery of a letter
from M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Az&#299;z Koka to &#703;Al&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n, the ruler of K&#863;handesh. I had had an impression
that he had a particular enmity to me on K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s account,
who was his son-in-law. From the discovery of this writing it became
clear that he had never given up his innate treachery, and had adopted
this unbecoming attitude towards my revered father also. In short, this
letter which he had written at some time to R&#257;ja &#703;Al&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb80" href="#v1pb80"
name="v1pb80">80</a>]</span>was from beginning to end full of abuse and
disapprobation, and said things which no enemy even could have written
and such as could not be attributed to anyone, and far less to one like
His Majesty, <i>&#703;Ars&#863;h-&#257;s&#863;hy&#257;n&#299;</i>, a
king and an appreciative sovereign, who from childhood had educated him
and brought him up because of what was due for services rendered by his
mother, and raised the standard of reliance on him to such a high
degree as no other person possessed. This letter fell into the hands of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan in Burhanpur amongst the
property of R&#257;ja &#703;Al&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n. He brought and
laid it before me. In reading and seeing it the hair on my limbs stood
on end. But for the consideration and due recognition of the fact that
his mother had given her milk to my father I could have killed him with
my own hand. Having procured his attendance I gave the letter into his
hand and told him to read it with a loud voice to those present. When
he saw the letter I thought his body would have parted from his soul,
but with shamelessness and impudence he read it as though he had not
written it and was reading it by order. Those present in that
paradise-like assembly of the servants of Akbar and Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
and heard the letter read, loosened the tongue of reproach and of
curses and abuse. I put the question to him, &ldquo;Leaving aside the
treacheries which in reliance on your worthless self you contrived
against <i>my</i> fortune, what was done to you by my father, who
raised you and your family from the dust of the road to such wealth and
dignity as to make you the envy of your contemporaries, that you should
write these things to the enemies of his Empire? Why did you enrol
yourself amongst the wicked and disloyal? Truly, what can one make of
an original nature and innate disposition? Since your temperament has
been nourished by the water of treachery, what else can spring up but
such actions? Passing over what you did to myself, I gave you the rank
you had held before, thinking that your treachery <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb81" href="#v1pb81" name=
"v1pb81">81</a>]</span>was directed against me only. Since it has
become known that you behaved in a similar way to your benefactor and
visible Deity, I leave you to the thoughts and actions which you
formerly had and still have.&rdquo; After these remarks his lips
closed, and he was unable to make any reply. What could he have said in
the presence of such disgrace? I gave an order to deprive him of his
jagir. Although what this ingrate had done was unpardonable, yet in the
end, from certain considerations, I passed it over.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday the 26th of the above-mentioned month was held
the marriage feast of Parw&#299;z and the daughter of Prince
Mur&#257;d. The ceremony was performed in the house of Her Highness
Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;. The entertainment was arranged in the house of
Parw&#299;z, and all who were present were exalted with all kinds of
honour and civilities. Nine thousand rupees were handed over to
S&#863;harif &#256;mul&#299; and other nobles, to be given in alms to
faqirs and other poor people.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday the 10th Rajab I left the city to hunt in
Girjhak and Nandana,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2647src" href=
"#xd24e2647" name="xd24e2647src">159</a> and took up my quarters in the
garden of R&#257;m D&#257;s, where I remained four days.</p>
<p class="par">On Wednesday the 13th the solar weighing of Parw&#299;z
took place. They weighed him twelve times against various metals and
other things, and each weighing came to two maunds and eighteen seers.
I ordered the whole to be distributed amongst faqirs. At this time the
rank of S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n was fixed at 1,500
personal and 700 horse, original and extra.</p>
<p class="par">After the march of M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;
and his force it occurred to me to send a second contingent after him.
Having bestowed on Bah&#257;dur<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2654src"

Q&#363;rbeg&#299; the rank of 1,500 personal and 800 horse, original

leadership of S&#863;h&#257;h Beg and Muh&#803;ammad Am&#299;n. For the
expenses of this force 200,000 rupees were given and 1,000 musketeers
were also appointed.</p>
<p class="par">I left &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n to guard
K&#863;husrau and defend Lahore. The Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; was
deprived of the honour of waiting on me, as he had a severe illness and
remained in the city. &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299;,
who had been summoned from the R&#257;n&#257;&rsquo;s country, was
promoted to be bakhshi at headquarters, and it was ordered that in
company with &#703;Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan he should perform this
service permanently. Following my father&rsquo;s rule, I appoint two
men in association in the discharge of the chief offices, not from want
of confidence in them, but because, as they are mortal and no man is
safe from accidents or illness, if any confusion or obstacle should
present itself to one the other is there so that the affairs of the
servants of God may not come to ruin.</p>
<p class="par">At this time also news came that at the Dasahr&#257;,
which is one of the fixed feast days of the Hindus, &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n had made an incursion from K&#257;lp&#299;, which is
his jagir, into the province of Band&#299;lah, and displaying great
valour made prisoner R&#257;m Chand, son of Madh&#363;kar, who for a
long time had made a centre of disturbance in that difficult country
and taken him to K&#257;lp&#299;. For this service he was presented
with a standard and raised to 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse.</p>
<p class="par">Petitions from the subah of Bihar represented that
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n had had a battle with
Sangr&#257;m, one of the chief zamindars of Bihar, who had about 4,000
horse and innumerable foot, on account of certain opposition and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb83" href="#v1pb83" name=
"v1pb83">83</a>]</span>disloyalty on rough land, and that on the field
the aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n had exerted himself manfully. In the end
Sangr&#257;m died of a gunshot wound; many of his men fell in the
battle, and those saved from the sword took to flight. Since this
distinguished affair had been brought about by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, I promoted him to the rank of 4,500 personal
and 3,500 horse.</p>
<p class="par">Three months and six days passed by in hunting; 581
animals were captured with the gun, hunting leopards and nets, and a
<i>qamarg&#257;h</i>; of these 158 were killed by my own gun. The
qamargah was held twice; on one occasion in Girjh&#257;k, when the
ladies were present, 155 animals were killed; and the second time, in
Nand&#299;na, 110.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2682src" href=
"#xd24e2682" name="xd24e2682src">162</a> The details of the animals
killed are as follows: mountain sheep, 180; mountain goats, 29; wild
asses, 10; Nilgai, 9; antelope, etc., 348.</p>
<p class="par">On Wednesday the 16th Shaww&#257;l I returned safe from
my hunting, and when one watch and six gharis of day had passed I
entered Lahore on the day named. During this hunting a strange affair
was witnessed. At Chandw&#257;lah, where a minaret had been erected, I
had wounded in the belly a black antelope. When wounded, a sound
proceeded from him such as I have never heard from any antelope, except
in the rutting season. Old hunters and those with me were astonished,
and said they never remembered nor had they heard from their fathers
that such a voice issued from an antelope except at rutting time. This
has been written down because it is not void of strangeness. I found
the flesh of the mountain goat more delicious than that of all wild
animals, although its skin is exceedingly ill-odoured, so much so that
even when tanned the scent is not destroyed. I ordered one of the
largest of the he-goats to be weighed; it was 2 maunds and 24 seers,
equal to 21 foreign maunds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb84" href=
"#v1pb84" name="v1pb84">84</a>]</span>(Persian). I ordered a large ram
to be weighed, and it came to 2 maunds and 3 seers <i>Akbar&#299;</i>,
equal to 17 Persian (<i>wil&#257;yat&#299;</i>) maunds. The largest and
strongest of the wild asses weighed 9 maunds and 16 seers, equal to 76
Persian (wil&#257;yat&#299;) maunds. I have frequently heard from
hunters and those fond of the chase that at a certain regular time a
worm develops in the horns of the mountain ram, and that this worm
causes an irritation which induces the ram to fight with his hind, and
that if he finds no rival he strikes his head against a tree or a rock
to allay the irritation. After enquiry it seems that the same worm
appears in the horn of the female sheep, and since the female does not
fight the statement is clearly untrue. Though the flesh of the wild ass
is lawful food and most men like to eat it, it was in no way suited to
my taste.</p>

of Dul&#299;p in the neighbourhood of N&#257;gor, which is in the subah

no way of escape, of necessity he planted a firm foot and came to blows
with the royal army. After a short encounter he was badly beaten and
gave over many to slaughter, and himself, taking with him his own
effects, fled into the vale of ruin.</p>

its flowers being double and treble is obscure. Erskine renders the

curious that Jah&#257;ng&#299;r should give the 18th
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal as his birthday, while the authorities give it

Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s writing Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal instead of
S&#863;hahr&#299;war. His birthday was Ras&#863;hn the 18th day of
S&#863;hahr&#299;war (see Akbarn&#257;ma, ii, 344), but it was the 17th
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal. See Muh&#803;ammad H&#257;d&#299;&rsquo;s
preface, p. 2, and Beale, and Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s own statement
a few lines above. Possibly Jah&#257;ng&#299;r wished to make out that
he was born on the 18th Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal and a Thursday,
because he regarded Thursday as a blessed day (<i>mub&#257;rak

not so in the MSS. If it were, we should have thirteen instead of

regulation about releasing the prisoners, Sir Henry Elliot is somewhat
unjust to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r in his commentary at p. 515. It was only
those who had been <i>long</i> imprisoned whom Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
released, and his proceedings at Ranthambhor in the 13th year
(T&#363;zuk, p. 256) show that he exercised discrimination in releasing
prisoners. The account in Price, p. 10, may also be consulted. There
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r says he released 7,000 men from Gwalior alone. It
may be remembered that most of these were political offenders. Private
criminals were for the most part put to death, or mutilated, or fined.

&ldquo;To have always in readiness in the arsenal arms, and

a musket, and in Hindustani we are familiar with the word

<i>&#299;lch&#299;</i>, which commonly means an ambassador&mdash;an

Akbar read (see Akbarn&#257;ma, ii, 19). &#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f

means that it was Naq&#299;b&rsquo;s father who taught Akbar, or he has

Something seems to have fallen out of the text and MSS., for this
passage is obscure and not connected with the context. It is clearer in
Price&rsquo;s version, where it is brought in as part of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s statements about promotions, and where (p.
40) we read as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I shall now return to the more
grateful subject of recording rewards and advancements.... On
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Zakariyy&#257;, the son of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Muh&#803;ammad Yah&#803;y&#257;, although in disgrace, I conferred the
rank of 500. This I was induced to do on the recommendation of the
venerated S&#863;haik&#863;h H&#803;usain J&#257;m&#299;. Six months
previous to my accession,&rdquo; etc. Evidently the statement about
Zakariyy&#257;&rsquo;s promotion has been omitted accidentally from the
T&#363;zuk. There is a reference to the S&#863;haik&#863;h&rsquo;s
dream in Muh&#803;ammad H&#257;d&#299;&rsquo;s preface to the
T&#363;zuk (p. 15). He says there that it was the saint
Bah&#257;&#702;u-l-h&#803;aqq who appeared in a dream to H&#803;usain
J&#257;m&#299; and told him that Sult&#804;&#257;n Sal&#299;m would

somewhat by the MS. used by Price (trans., pp. 82, 83), where more

<p class="par first">On Wednesday the 22nd Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da,
1015 (10th March, 1607), when 3&frac12; gharis of the day had passed,
the sun rose to his House of Honour. They decorated the palace after
the usual fashion: a great entertainment was prepared, and having
seated myself at an auspicious hour on the throne of accession I
exalted the nobles and courtiers with kindness and favour. On this same
auspicious day it was learned from the reports sent from Qandahar that
the army sent under M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;, son of
M&#299;rz&#257; J&#257;n&#299;, to succour (which had been appointed to
assist) S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, had entered the city of
Qandahar on the 12th of Shaww&#257;l. When the Persians heard of the
arrival of the victorious army at the last stage before the aforesaid
city,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2725src" href="#xd24e2725" name=

and did not draw rein until they had reached the Helmand, fifty or
sixty kos distant.</p>
<p class="par">In the second place it became known that the governor of
Far&#257;h and a number of the officers of that neighbourhood had taken
it into their heads, after the death of the late king, that in this
confusion Qandahar might easily fall into their hands, and without
waiting for an order from S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s had
collected together and won over the Chief of Sewist&#257;n
(S&#299;st&#257;n). Sending someone to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of Herat they asked for support from him.
He also sent a force. After that they turned to attack Qandahar.
S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of that place, seeing
that battle has two heads, and that if (which God forbid!) he should be
defeated he would lose possession of Qandahar, thought that to confine
himself in a fort would be better than to fight. He therefore
determined to hold the fort, and sent quick messengers to the Court. It
happened that at this time the royal standards had started from Agra in
pursuit of K&#863;husrau, and had arrived at Lahore. Immediately on
hearing this news (from S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n), a large
force was sent off of amirs and mansabdars under M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;. Before the M&#299;rz&#257; reached Qandahar the
news had been carried to the S&#863;h&#257;h (of Persia) that the
governor of Far&#257;h, with some of the jagirdars of that
neighbourhood, had proceeded towards the province of Qandahar.
Considering this an improper proceeding, he sent H&#803;usain Beg, a
well-known man and one of his own intimates to make enquiries. He also
sent a farman in their names that they should move away from the
vicinity of Qandahar and go to their own places and abodes, because the
friendship and amity of his ancestors with the dignified family of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h were of old standing. That
body, before the arrival of H&#803;usain Beg and the King&rsquo;s
order, not being able to oppose the royal army, considered the
opportunity of returning a favourable one. The said H&#803;usain Beg
censured the men and started off to wait on me, which he had the honour
to do at Lahore. He explained that the ill-fated army which had
attacked Qandahar had acted without the order of S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;Abb&#257;s. God forbid (he said) that in consequence of this any
unpleasantness should remain in my mind. In short, after the victorious
troops reached Qandahar, they, according to orders, delivered the fort
over to Sard&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, and S&#863;h&#257;h Beg
K&#863;h&#257;n returned to Court with the relieving force.

him over to R&#257;ja B&#257;so that he might take security and release

with the rank of 3,000 personal and 1,500 horse, and presented him with
a standard and drums, I promoted him to the distinction of sonship
(<i>farzand&#299;</i>) beyond his fellows and equals. The ancestors and

Daulat K&#863;h&#257;n, uncle of &#7778;al&#257;bat

his younger son, Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n, to wait upon H.M.
B&#257;bar in Kabul, and suggested to him the acquisition of Hindustan.
As B&#257;bar also had this enterprise in mind, he at once proceeded in
that direction, and did not turn his rein till he reached the
neighbourhood of Lahore. Daulat K&#863;h&#257;n with his followers
obtained the good fortune to wait upon him, and performed loyal
service. As he was an old man, adorned with inward and outward
excellencies, he did much good service. He (B&#257;bar) generally

Kabul. When he (B&#257;bar) came a second time into the Panjab with
intent to invade Hindustan, Daulat K&#863;h&#257;n waited on him, and
about the same time died. Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n was honoured
with the title of K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n and was with
B&#257;bar in the battle he had with Ibr&#257;h&#299;m. In the same way
he was permanently in waiting on the late king Hum&#257;y&#363;n. In
the <i>th&#257;n&#257;</i> of Mungir, at the time of his

against S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n Afg&#863;h&#257;n, and was made
prisoner on the field of battle. Although S&#863;h&#299;r
K&#863;h&#257;n urged him to take service with him, he refused and
said, &ldquo;Thy ancestors were always the servants of mine: how, then,
could I do this?&rdquo; S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n was enraged,

to Gujarat, where &#703;Umar K&#863;h&#257;n died. Daulat

Khandesh and the fort of &#256;s&#299;r, returned to Agra, he left
D&#257;niy&#257;l in charge of that province and of all the provinces
acquired from the rulers of the Deccan. At this time D&#257;niy&#257;l
had separated Daulat K&#863;h&#257;n from the

in him a good disposition and natural abilities, I raised the pedestal
of regard for him to the point that has been described. To-day there is
not in my government any person of greater influence than he, so much
so that on his representation I pass over faults which are not pardoned
at the intercession of any of the other servants of the Court. In

<p class="par">As I had made up my exalted mind to the conquest of
M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr (Transoxiana), which was the hereditary
kingdom of my ancestors, I desired to free the face of Hindustan from
the rubbish of the factious and rebellious, and leaving one of my sons
in that country, to go myself with a valiant army in due array, with
elephants of mountainous dignity and of lightning speed, and taking
ample treasure with me, to undertake the conquest of my ancestral
dominions. In accordance with this idea, I despatched Parw&#299;z to
drive back the R&#257;n&#257;, and intended to go myself to the Deccan,
when just at that moment the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb90"
href="#v1pb90" name="v1pb90">90</a>]</span>improper action of
K&#863;husrau took place, and it became necessary to pursue him and put
an end to that disturbance. For the same reason, the undertaking of
Parw&#299;z did not assume a promising appearance, and regarding the
exigency of the time he gave a respite to the R&#257;n&#257;. Bringing
with him one of the R&#257;n&#257;&rsquo;s sons, he came to wait on me,
and had the bliss of attending me in Lahore. When I was at ease about
K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s disturbance, and the repulse of the
Qizilb&#257;shes, who had invested Qandahar, had been brought about in
a facile way, it came into my mind to make a hunting tour to Kabul,
which is like my native land. After that I would return to Hindustan,
when the purposes of my mind would pass from design to action. In
pursuance of these steps, on the 7th Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja, at an
auspicious hour, I left the fort of Lahore and took up my quarters in
the Dil-&#257;m&#299;z Garden, which is on the other side of the Ravi,
and stayed there four days. Sunday, the 19th Farward&#299;n, which is
the culmination of His Majesty the Sun, I passed in the garden, and
some of the servants of the Court were favourably and kindly honoured
with increased rank. Ten thousand rupees were bestowed on Hasan Beg,
the envoy of the ruler of Persia (S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s).
Leaving Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, M&#299;r&#257;n &#7778;adr
Jah&#257;n, and M&#299;r S&#863;har&#299;f &#256;mul&#299; in Lahore, I
ordered them to settle in consultation any matters that might present
themselves. On Monday I marched from the garden mentioned, and encamped
at the village of Harhar, 3&frac12; kos distant from the city. On
Tuesday the royal standards alighted at Jah&#257;ng&#299;rp&#363;r,
which is one of my fixed hunting-places. In this neighbourhood had been
erected by my order a <i>man&#257;r</i> at the head of the grave of an
antelope called Mansar&#257;j,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2780src"
href="#xd24e2780" name="xd24e2780src">7</a> which was without equal in
fights with tame <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb91" href="#v1pb91"
name="v1pb91">91</a>]</span>antelopes and in hunting wild ones. On a
stone of that manar was carved this prose composition, written by
Mull&#257; Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain of Kashmir, who was the chief of
the elegant writers of the day: &ldquo;In this enchanting place an
antelope came into the world-holding (<i>jah&#257;n-g&#299;r&#299;</i>)
net of the God-knowing ruler N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h. In the space of one month, having overcome his
desert fierceness, he became the head of the special antelopes.&rdquo;
On account of the rare quality of this antelope, I commanded that no
person should hunt the deer of this plain, and that their flesh should
be to Hindus and Muhammadans as is the flesh of cows and pigs. They
made the gravestone in the shape of an antelope. I ordered Sikandar
Mu&#703;&#299;n, the jagirdar of the aforesaid pargana, to build a
strong fort in the village of Jahangirpur.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 14th, I encamped in the pargana of
Chand&#257;la.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2793src" href="#xd24e2793"
name="xd24e2793src">8</a> Thence on Saturday, the 16th, making one
stage in the middle, I came to

the station which had been erected by the exertions of the
<i>karor&#299;</i> of that place, M&#299;r Qiy&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n.
Having reached the Chen&#257;b in two marches on Thursday, the 21st
Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja, I crossed the river by a bridge which had
been built there and my camp was pitched in the neighbourhood of the
pargana of Gujrat. At the time when His Majesty Akbar went to Kashmir,
a fort had been built on that bank of the river. Having brought to this
fort a body of Gujars who had passed their time in the neighbourhood in
thieving and highway robbery, he established them here. As it had
become the abode of Gujars, he made it a separate pargana, and gave it
the name of Gujrat. They call Gujars a caste which does little manual
work and subsists on milk and curds. On Friday I pitched at
K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779;p&#363;r, five kos from Gujrat, founded
by K&#863;haw&#257;ss <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb92" href=
"#v1pb92" name="v1pb92">92</a>]</span>K&#863;h&#257;n, a slave of
S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n Afg&#863;h&#257;n. Thence, with two
halts in the middle, I pitched on the bank of the Biha&#7789; (Jhelam).
On that night a great wind blew and a black cloud hid the face of the
sky. The rain was of such violence that old men remembered none such.
It turned to hail, and every hailstone was the size of a hen&rsquo;s
egg. From the flooding of the river and the force of the wind and rain,
the bridge broke. I, with the inmates of the harem, crossed in a boat.
As there were few boats, I ordered the men not<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2804src" href="#xd24e2804" name="xd24e2804src">10</a> to cross in
these, but to rebuild the bridge. It was finished in a week, and the
whole army crossed with ease. The source of the Biha&#7789; is a spring
in Kashmir called the V&#299;r-n&#257;g; in the language of India a
snake is <i>v&#299;r-n&#257;g</i>. Clearly there had been a large snake
at that place. I went twice to the spring in my father&rsquo;s
lifetime; it is 20 kos from the city of Kashmir. It is an octagonal
reservoir about 20 yards by 20. Near it are the remains of a place of
worship for recluses; cells cut out of the rock and numerous caves. The
water is exceedingly pure. Although I could not guess its depth, a
grain of poppy-seed is visible until it touches the bottom. There were
many fish to be seen in it. As I had heard that it was unfathomable, I
ordered them to throw in a cord with a stone attached, and when this
cord was measured in <i>gaz</i> it became evident that the depth was
not more than once and a half the height of a man. After my accession I
ordered them to build the sides of the spring round with stone, and
they made a garden round it with a canal; and built halls and houses
about it, and made a place such that travellers over the world can
point out few like it. When the river reaches the village of
P&#257;mp&#363;r, at a distance of ten kos from the city, it increases,
and all the saffron of Kashmir is obtained in this village. I do not
know if there is so much saffron in any other place in the world.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb93" href="#v1pb93" name=
"v1pb93">93</a>]</span>The annual crop is 500 maunds by Hindustan
weight, equal to 5,000 <i>wil&#257;yat</i> (Persian) maunds. In
attendance on my revered father, I went to this place at the season
when the saffron was in flower. On other plants of the world, first the
branches (stems) shoot out and then the leaves and flowers. On the
contrary, when the saffron stem is four fingers breadth from the dry
ground, its flowers shoot out, of the colour of the iris,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e2819src" href="#xd24e2819" name=
"xd24e2819src">11</a> with four petals, and in the middle are four
threads (<i>r&#299;s&#863;ha</i>) of an orange colour like that of the
flower, and of the length of a finger-joint. This is the saffron. The
land is not ploughed<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2829src" href=
"#xd24e2829" name="xd24e2829src">12</a> or irrigated, the plant springs
up amongst the clods. In some places its cultivation extends for a kos,
and in others for half a kos. It looks better from a distance. At the
time of plucking, all my attendants got headache from its sharp scent.
Though I drank wine and took a cup, I too got headache. I asked the
animal-like Kashmiris, who were employed in picking the flowers how
they felt. I ascertained that they had never experienced headache in
their lives.</p>
<p class="par">The waters from the spring V&#299;r-n&#257;g and of
other streams and nullahs that join from right and left form the river
Bihat, which passes through the heart of the city. Its breadth in most
places is not more than a bowshot.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2840src"
href="#xd24e2840" name="xd24e2840src">13</a> No one drinks its water,
because of its heaviness and indigestibility. All the people of Kashmir
drink the water of a lake that is near the city, and is called Dall.
The river Bihat enters this lake and flows through to the Panjab by the
B&#257;r&#257;m&#363;la Pass, Pakl&#299;, and Dant&#363;r. <span class=

<p class="par">In Kashmir there is plenty of water from streams and
springs. By far the best is that of the L&#257;r valley, which joins
the Bihat in the village of S&#863;hih&#257;bu-d-d&#299;n-p&#363;r.
This village is one of the celebrated places of Kashmir, and is on the
Bihat. About a hundred plane-trees (<i>chan&#257;r</i>) of graceful
form clustered<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2851src" href="#xd24e2851"
name="xd24e2851src">14</a> together on one plot of ground, pleasant and
green, join each other so as to shade the whole plot, and the whole
surface of the ground is grass and trefoil<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2854src" href="#xd24e2854" name="xd24e2854src">15</a>; so much so
that to lay a carpet on it would be superfluous and in bad taste. The
village was founded by Sult&#804;&#257;n
Zainu-l-&#703;&#257;bid&#299;n, who for 52 years ruled Kashmir with
absolute sway. They speak of him as the great P&#257;dsh&#257;h. They
tell many strange customs of his. There are many remains and traces of
buildings of his in Kashmir. One of these is in the midst of a lake
called Wul&#363;r, and of which the length and breadth are more than
three or four kos. It is called Zain-lank&#257;, and in making it they
have exerted themselves greatly. The springs of this lake are very
deep. The first time they brought a large quantity of stone in boats
and poured it on the place where now the building stands it had no
result. At last they sank some thousands of boats with stones, and with
great labour recovered a piece of ground 100 gaz by 100 gaz out of the
water, and made a terrace, and on one side thereof the Sultan erected a
temple for the worship of his supreme God. Than this there is no finer
place.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2868src" href="#xd24e2868" name=
"xd24e2868src">16</a> He often came to the spot by boat and engaged in
worship of the King of Wisdom. They say he spent many &ldquo;forty
days&rdquo; in that place. One day a wicked son of his came to that
place to kill him, and finding him alone, drew a sword and went in.
When his eye fell on the Sultan, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb95"
href="#v1pb95" name="v1pb95">95</a>]</span>however, on account of his
venerable dignity and the might of his virtues, he became confused and
bewildered and turned away. The Sultan shortly after came out and
seated himself in the boat with this same son, and started for the
city. On the way he said to his son, &ldquo;I have forgotten my rosary;
get into a canoe and fetch it for me.&rdquo; The son having gone into
the temple sees his father in the same place, and the graceless man
with complete shame of face falls at his father&rsquo;s feet and asks
pardon for his fault. They have told many tales of such miracles as
this of him, and they say also that he had well practised the science
of <i>k&#863;hala&#703;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2883src" href=
"#xd24e2883" name="xd24e2883src">17</a> When, from the ways and methods
of his sons, he perceived in them signs of haste in seeking for rule
and government, he would say to them, &ldquo;To me it is very easy to
abandon rule, and even to pass away from life, but when I am gone you
will do nothing and the time of your prosperity will not endure long,
but in a short time you will obtain the recompense of your evil deeds
and your own dispositions.&rdquo; Having spoken thus, he gave up eating
and drinking, and passed forty days in this manner. He made not his eye
acquainted with sleep, and employed himself after the manner of men of
piety and austerity in the worship of God Almighty. On the fortieth day
he gave up the deposit of his existence, and entered into the mercy of
God. He left three sons&mdash;&#256;dam K&#863;h&#257;n,
H&#803;&#257;j&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, and Bahr&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n.
They quarrelled with each other, and all three were ruined. The
government of Kashmir was transferred to the tribe of the Chaks, who
belonged to the class of the common soldiers of the country. During
their dynasty three of the rulers constructed buildings on three sides
of the terrace formed by Zainu-l-&#703;&#257;bid&#299;n in the Wulur
Lake, but none of these is as strong as his. <span class=

<p class="par">Autumn and Spring in Kashmir are things worthy to be
seen. I witnessed the Autumn season, and it appeared to me to be better
than what I had heard of it. I have never seen Spring in that province,
but hope to do so some day. On Saturday the 1st of Muh&#803;arram (18th
April, 1607) I left the bank of the Bihat, and with one day between
reached the fort of Roht&#257;s, which was built by S&#863;h&#299;r
K&#863;h&#257;n Afg&#863;h&#257;n. This fort was founded in a cleft of
the ground, and the strength of it cannot be imagined. As the place is
near the Ghakhar territory, and they are a proud and rebellious people,
he had looked to this fort specially as a means of punishing and
defeating them. When a little of the building had been done
S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n died and his son, Sal&#299;m

the fort; 16 krors, 10 lakhs of dams, and more were expended, equal in
Hindustan reckoning to 4,025,000 rupees, and according to the currency

<p class="par">On Tuesday the 4th of the month, having travelled four
kos and three-quarters, I encamped at T&#299;la.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2909src" href="#xd24e2909" name="xd24e2909src">20</a> Thence I
came down to the village of Bhakra. In the Ghakhar <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb97" href="#v1pb97" name=

"xd24e2916src" href="#xd24e2916" name="xd24e2916src">21</a> is a
jungle. The jungle was composed of clusters of flowers, white and
scentless. I came the whole way from T&#299;la to Bhakra in the middle
of the river-bed,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2925src" href="#xd24e2925"
name="xd24e2925src">22</a> which had running water in it, with oleander
flowers of the colour of peach-blossom. In Hindustan this plant is
always in full bloom (<i>purb&#257;r</i>). There was much of it on the
banks of this river. The horsemen and men on foot who were with me were
told to put bunches of the flower on their heads, and whoever did not
do so had his turban taken off; a wonderful flower-bed was
produced.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday the 6th of the month the halting-place was
at Haty&#257;. On this road many pal&#257;s-trees (<i>Butea
frondosa</i>) were in blossom. This flower, too, is peculiar to the
jungles of Hindustan; it has no scent, but its colour is flaming
orange. The base of the flower is black; the flower itself is as big as
a red rose. It is so beautiful that one cannot take one&rsquo;s eyes
off it. As the air was very sweet and clouds had hidden the sun, and
rain was gently sprinkled about, I felt an inclination to drink wine.
In short this road was traversed with great enjoyment and pleasure.
They call the place Haty&#257; because it was founded by a Ghakkar
named H&#257;thi (elephant). From M&#257;rgala to Haty&#257; the
country is called Poth&#363;w&#257;r.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2944src" href="#xd24e2944" name="xd24e2944src">23</a> In these
regions there are few crows. From Roht&#257;s to Haty&#257; is the
place and abode of the Bh&#363;gy&#257;ls,<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">Marching on Friday the 7th, I travelled 4&frac12; kos
and alighted at the station of Pakka.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2952src" href="#xd24e2952" name="xd24e2952src">25</a> This place
is called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb98" href="#v1pb98" name=
"v1pb98">98</a>]</span>Pakka because the <i>sar&#257;y</i> is of burnt
brick, and in the Hindi language what is ripe (that is, not raw
material) is called <i>pakka</i>. The station was strangely full of
dust and earth. The carts reached it with great difficulty owing to the
badness of the road. They had brought from Kabul to this place
<i>r&#299;w&#257;j</i> (rhubarb), which was mostly spoiled.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday the 8th we marched 4&frac12; kos and
encamped at the village of Khar.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2968src"
href="#xd24e2968" name="xd24e2968src">26</a> <i>Khar</i> in the Ghakkar
language is a rent and breakage. There are few trees in this country.
On Sunday the 9th I halted beyond R&#257;walpind&#299;. This place was
founded by a Hindu named R&#257;wal, and <i>pind&#299;</i> in the
Ghakkar tongue means a village. In the valley near this station there
was a stream flowing, the waters of which were collected in a pool. As
this halting-place was not devoid of freshness I alighted there for a
time, and I asked the Ghakkars the depth of the pool. They gave me no
precise answer, but said they had heard from their fathers that there
were alligators in the pool which wounded animals that came there, and
on that account no one had the boldness to go in. I ordered them to
throw in a sheep. It swam across the pool and came out. I then ordered
a <i>farr&#257;s&#863;h</i> to go in, and he also came out safe. It
thus became clear that there was no foundation for what the Ghakkars
had said. The pool was an arrow&rsquo;s flight in width.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday the 10th the village of
K&#863;harb&#363;za<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2982src" href=
"#xd24e2982" name="xd24e2982src">27</a> was our stage. The Ghakkars in
earlier times had built a dome here and taken tolls from travellers. As
the dome was shaped like a melon it became known by that name. On
Tuesday the 11th I halted at K&#257;la-p&#257;n&#299;, which in Hindi
means black water. There is a mountain pass (<i>kotal</i>) at this
place called M&#257;rgalla; in Hindi <i>m&#257;r</i> means <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb99" href="#v1pb99" name="v1pb99">99</a>]</span>to
beat and <i>galla</i> is a caravan, the name therefore means the place
of the plundering of the caravan. The boundary of the Ghakkar country
is here. This tribe are wonderfully like animals; they are always
squabbling and fighting with one another. Although I wished to put an
end to this fighting, I was unable to do so.</p>

<p class="par first">On Wednesday the 12th the camp was at
B&#257;b&#257; H&#803;asan Abd&#257;l. One kos to the east of this
station there is a waterfall over which the stream rushes with great
force. There is no fall like it on the way to Kabul. On the road to
Kashmir there are two or three like it.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">In the middle of the basin, in which is the source of
the stream, R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh has erected a small building.
There are many fish in the basin of the length of half a gaz and a
quarter gaz. I halted three days at this enchanting place, drinking
wine with those who were intimate with me and employing myself in
catching fish. Until now I had never thrown a <i>sufra</i> net, which
is a famous kind of net, and which in Hindi they call
<i>bhanwar</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e3014src" href="#xd24e3014"
name="xd24e3014src">30</a> <i>j&#257;l</i>. It is not easy to throw. I
threw it with my own hand and caught twelve fish, and putting pearls
into their noses,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3022src" href="#xd24e3022"
name="xd24e3022src">31</a> let them loose in the water. I enquired
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb100" href="#v1pb100" name=
"v1pb100">100</a>]</span>into the story of B&#257;b&#257; H&#803;asan
from the story-tellers and from the inhabitants of the place, but no
one could tell me any particulars. The celebrated place at that station
is a spring which flows from the foot of a little hill, exceedingly
clear, sweet, and nice, as witness this couplet of Am&#299;r
K&#863;husrau:&mdash;</p>

Muh&#803;ammad K&#863;hw&#257;f&#299;, who was for long employed as
Vizier by my revered father, had made a platform and a reservoir there,
into which is led the water from the spring, and thence is used in
cultivation and in gardens. On the edge of this terrace he had built a
dome for his own burial. By chance his destiny was not there, and (the
bodies of) H&#803;ak&#299;m Ab&#363;-l-fath&#803; G&#299;l&#257;n&#299;
and his brother H&#803;ak&#299;m Hum&#257;m, who were close to the
person and had the complete confidence of my revered father, were
placed in that dome in accordance with his order.</p>
<p class="par">On the 15th the halt was at Amroh&#299;.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3038src" href="#xd24e3038" name=
"xd24e3038src">32</a> It is a wonderfully green place, in which no ups
and downs were visible. In this village and its neighbourhood there are
7,000 or 8,000 households of Khaturs and Dal&#257;z&#257;ks. All kinds
of mischief and oppression and highway robbery take place through this
tribe. I ordered the government of this region and Attock to be given
to Z&#804;afar K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Zain K&#863;h&#257;n Koka, and
that by the time of the return of the royal standards from Kabul they
should march all the Dal&#257;z&#257;ks to Lahore and capture the head
men of the Khaturs and keep them in prison. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb101" href="#v1pb101" name=
"v1pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 17th, a march was made, and, with one
stage in between, the royal standards alighted near the fort of Attock
on the bank of the river N&#299;l&#257;b (Indus). At this stage
Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n was promoted to the rank of 2,500. This
fort was built by the late king Akbar, and was completed by the labours
of K&#863;hw&#257;ja S&#863;hamsu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;hw&#257;f&#299;. It
is a strong fort. At this time the water of the N&#299;l&#257;b was
low,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3045src" href="#xd24e3045" name=
"xd24e3045src">33</a> and accordingly a bridge had been made with
eighteen boats, and the people crossed over easily. I left the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; at Attock on account of weakness of body and
illness. An order was given to the bakhshis that, as the province of
Kabul could not support a large army, they should only allow the
immediate attendants of the Court to cross the river, and until the
return of the royal standards the royal camp should remain at Attock.
On Wednesday, the 19th, with the princes and some of the private
servants, having mounted on to a raft (with inflated skins underneath),
and having crossed the river N&#299;l&#257;b safely, I alighted on the
bank of the river K&#257;ma. The K&#257;ma is a river that flows by the
<i>qa&#7779;ba</i> (fortified town) of Jal&#257;l&#257;b&#257;d. The
<i>j&#257;la</i> is a structure they make of bamboos and grass and
place underneath it skins full of air. In this province they call them
<i>s&#863;h&#257;l</i> (or <i>s&#257;l</i>). In rivers and streams in
which there are rocks they are safer than boats. 12,000 rupees were
given to M&#299;r S&#863;har&#299;f &#256;mul&#299; and to a number of
men, who had been appointed to perform services at Lahore, to divide
amongst the faqirs. An order was given to &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q
Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3063src" href=
"#xd24e3063" name="xd24e3063src">34</a> and to Bih&#257;r&#299;
D&#257;s, bakhshi of the Ahadis, to complete the force that had been
appointed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb102" href="#v1pb102" name=
"v1pb102">102</a>]</span>to accompany Z&#804;afar K&#863;h&#257;n and
send them away. With one stage in between, the camp halted at the saray
of B&#257;ra. On the other side of the river K&#257;ma there is a fort
which Zain K&#863;h&#257;n Koka built at the time when he was appointed
to subjugate the Y&#363;sufza&#702;e Afghans, and called Naus&#863;hahr
(Newcastle). About 50,000 rupees were spent upon it. They say that
Hum&#257;y&#363;n used to hunt rhinoceros in this region. I also heard
from my father that he had twice or thrice witnessed such a hunt in the
company of his father. On Thursday, the 25th, I alighted at the saray
of Daulat&#257;b&#257;d. Ah&#803;mad Beg of Kabul, jagirdar of
Peshawar, with the Maliks of the Y&#363;sufza&#702;es and the
G&#863;horiya-khel, came and waited on me. As the service of
Ah&#803;mad Beg was not approved, I transferred him from that territory
(wil&#257;yat) and conferred it on S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n, the
Afghan. On Wednesday, the 26th, I encamped in the garden of Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, which he had made in the neighbourhood of Peshawar. I
walked round Ghorkhatr&#299;, which is the worshipping-place of the
jog&#299;s in this neighbourhood, with the idea that I might see some
faqirs from association with whom I might obtain grace. But that was
like looking for the ph&oelig;nix or the philosopher&rsquo;s stone. A
herd without any religious knowledge came to my view, from seeing whom
I derived nothing but obscurity of mind. On Thursday, the 27th, I
arrived at the halting-place of Jamr&#363;d, and on Friday, 28th, at
the K&#863;haibar Kotal (Khyber Pass) and encamped at &#703;Al&#299;
Masjid, and on Saturday I traversed the tortuous
(<i>m&#257;rp&#299;ch</i>, i.e. snake-twisting) Pass, and alighted at
G&#863;har&#299;b-k&#863;h&#257;na. At this stage Ab&#363;-l-q&#257;sim
Namak&#299;n, Jagirdar of Jal&#257;l&#257;b&#257;d, brought an apricot,
which was not inferior in beauty to good Kashmir apricots. At the stage
of Daka they brought from Kabul <i>g&#299;l&#257;s</i> (cherries),
which my revered father had entitled
<i>S&#863;h&#257;h-&#257;l&#363;</i>. As I was much inclined to eat
them, inasmuch as I had not (hitherto?) obtained them, I ate them with
great zest as a relish to wine. On Tuesday, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb103" href="#v1pb103" name=
"v1pb103">103</a>]</span>2nd &#7778;afar, I encamped at Bas&#257;wal,
which is on the bank of the river. On the other side of the river there
is a mountain which has no trees or grass on it, and on that account
they call this mountain the hill of B&#299;daulat (unfortunate). I
heard from my father that in mountains like this there are mines of
gold. On the mountain of &#256;la B&#363;gh&#257;n, at the time when my
revered father went to Kabul, I had had a <i>qamarg&#257;h</i> hunt,
and killed several<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3083src" href=
"#xd24e3083" name="xd24e3083src">35</a> red deer. As I had handed over
the administration of all civil affairs to the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257;,
and his illness increased greatly, and forgetfulness came over his
faculties to such an extent that what was settled in one hour he forgot
in the next, and his forgetfulness was increasing day by day, on
Wednesday, the 3rd &#7778;afar, I entrusted the duties of the
viziership to &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, presenting him with a
special robe of honour, and inkstand and a jewelled pen. It was a
remarkable coincidence that twenty-eight years previously to this, at
the same halting-place, my revered father had promoted him<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3092src" href="#xd24e3092" name=
"xd24e3092src">36</a> to the rank of M&#299;r Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;
(chief paymaster). A ruby which his brother<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3095src" href="#xd24e3095" name="xd24e3095src">37</a>
Ab&#363;-l-q&#257;sim had bought for 40,000 rupees and sent him, he
presented as an offering on obtaining the viziership. He petitioned
that K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan, who held the offices of
bakhshi and the <i>Q&#363;r</i>, etc., might go with him.
Jal&#257;l&#257;b&#257;d was transferred from Ab&#363;-l-q&#257;sim
Namak&#299;n to Arab K&#863;h&#257;n. A white rock was present in the
river-bed; I ordered them to carve it in the form of an elephant
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb104" href="#v1pb104" name=
"v1pb104">104</a>]</span>and cut upon its breast this hemistich, which
agrees with the date of the Hijra year: &ldquo;The white stone elephant
of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h,&rdquo; that is,
1016.</p>
<p class="par">On the same day Kaly&#257;n, son of R&#257;ja
Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, came from Gujarat. Certain extraordinary
proceedings on the part of this rebellious rascal had been reported to
me. Amongst these was this. He had kept a <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e3111" title="Source: Musulm&#257;n">Musulman</span>
<i>l&#363;l&#299;</i> woman in his house, and for fear this affair
should become known had killed her father and mother and buried them in
his house. I ordered that he should be imprisoned until I could enquire
into his proceedings, and after ascertaining the truth I ordered first
that they should cut out his tongue and place him in perpetual
confinement, and that he should eat his food with dog-keepers and
outcasts. On Wednesday I encamped at Surk&#863;h&#257;b. Thence I
alighted at Jagdalak. At this stage I saw many
<i>ball&#363;t&#804;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e3119src" href=
"#xd24e3119" name="xd24e3119src">38</a>-trees (oak or chestnut), which
are the best wood for burning. Although this stage had neither passes
nor declivities there were plenty of rocks. On Friday, the 12th, I
encamped at &#256;b-i-b&#257;r&#299;k, and Saturday, the 13th, at
Y&#363;rt-i-p&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h. On Sunday, the 14th, I alighted at
K&#863;h&#363;rd K&#257;bul (little Kabul). At this stage I entrusted
the Chief Justiceship and Qaziship of the city of Kabul to
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; &#703;&#256;rif, son of Mull&#257; S&#257;diq
Halw&#257;&#702;&#299;. They brought some ripe
<i>s&#863;h&#257;h-&#257;l&#363;</i> (cherries) from the village of
Gulbah&#257;r to this place; of these I ate with much enjoyment nearly
a hundred. Daulat, the head of the village of Jigr&#299;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3131src" href="#xd24e3131" name=
"xd24e3131src">39</a>(?), brought some uncommon flowers, such as I had
never seen in my life. Thence I alighted at Bikr&#257;m&#299;. At this
place they brought to show me a piebald<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3138src" href="#xd24e3138" name="xd24e3138src">40</a> animal,
like the flying (i.e. jumping) mouse, which in the Hindi tongue they
call <i>galahr&#299;</i> (squirrel), and said that mice would not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb105" href="#v1pb105" name=
"v1pb105">105</a>]</span>frequent any house in which this animal was.
On this account they call this animal the master of mice. As I had
never seen one before, I ordered my painters to draw a likeness of it.
It is larger than a mongoose. On the whole it is very like a civet cat.
Having appointed Ah&#803;mad Beg K&#863;h&#257;n to punish the Afghans
of Bangas&#863;h, I ordered &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q
Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299;, who was in Attock, to take 2,000,000 rupees
under the charge of Mohan D&#257;s, son of R&#257;ja
Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, with him, and divide it among the auxiliaries of
the aforesaid army. One thousand musketeers were also ordered to
accompany this army.</p>
<p class="par">S&#863;haik&#863;h &#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;m&#257;n, son

of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, and obtained the title of

which was the encamping place for the royal standards, scattering
rupees, half-rupees, and quarter-rupees to faqirs and indigent persons
on both sides of the road, I entered the aforesaid garden. It appeared
to be very green and fresh. As it was a Thursday I gave a wine
entertainment to my intimates, and on account of hilarity and
excitement ordered those who were of equal age to myself and had been
my playfellows to jump over the stream that flowed through the middle
of the garden and was about four gaz in width. Most of them could not
jump it, and fell on the bank or into the stream. Although I jumped it,
yet now that I was 40 years of age I could not jump it with the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb106" href="#v1pb106" name=
"v1pb106">106</a>]</span>activity that I had shown in the presence of
my revered father when I was 30. On this day I perambulated seven of
the famous gardens of Kabul. I do not think that I ever walked so far
before.</p>
<p class="par">First of all I walked round the
S&#863;hahr-&#257;r&#257; (city-adorning), then the Maht&#257;b
(moonlight) garden, then the garden that B&#299;ka Begam, grandmother
of my father, had made, then passed through the
&#362;rta-b&#257;g&#863;h (middle garden), then a garden that
Maryam-mak&#257;n&#299;, my own grandmother, had prepared, then the
&#7778;&#363;rat-k&#863;h&#257;na garden, which has a large
<i>chan&#257;r</i>-tree, the like of which there is not in the other
gardens of Kabul. Then, having seen the Ch&#257;rb&#257;g&#863;h, which
is the largest of the city gardens, I returned to my own abode. There
were abundance of cherries on the trees, each of which looked as it
were a round ruby, hanging like globes on the branches. The
S&#863;hahr-&#257;r&#257; garden was made by

"#xd24e3163" name="xd24e3163src">43</a> Begam, daughter of
M&#299;rz&#257; Ab&#363; Sa&#703;&#299;d, who was own aunt to the late
king B&#257;bar. From time to time it has been added to, and there is
not a garden like it for sweetness in Kabul. It has all sorts of fruits
and grapes, and its softness is such that to put one&rsquo;s
sandalled<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3166src" href="#xd24e3166" name=
"xd24e3166src">44</a> feet on it would be far from propriety or good
manners. In the neighbourhood of this garden an excellent plot of land
came to view, which I ordered to be bought from the owners. I ordered a
stream that flows from the <i>guz&#817;arg&#257;h</i> (ferry, also
bleaching green) to be diverted into the middle of the ground so that a
garden might be made such that in beauty and sweetness there should not
be in the inhabited world another like it. I gave it the name of
Jah&#257;n-&#257;r&#257; (world-adorning). Whilst I was at Kabul I had
several entertainments in the S&#863;hahr-&#257;r&#257; garden,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb107" href="#v1pb107" name=
"v1pb107">107</a>]</span>sometimes with my intimates and courtiers and
sometimes with the ladies of the harem. At nights I ordered the learned
and the students of Kabul to hold the cooking entertainment,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3177src" href="#xd24e3177" name=
"xd24e3177src">45</a> <i>bug&#863;hra</i>, and the throwing of
bug&#863;hra, together with <i>arg&#863;hus&#863;htak</i> dances.</p>
<p class="par">To each of the band of
<i>Bug&#863;hr&#257;&#702;iy&#257;n</i> I gave a dress of honour, and
also gave 1,000 rupees to divide amongst themselves. To twelve of the
trustworthy courtiers I ordered 12,000 rupees to be given, to be
bestowed every Thursday, as long as I was in Kabul, on the poor and
needy. I gave an order that between two plane-trees that were on the
canal bank in the middle of the garden&mdash;to one of which I had
given the name of Far&#257;h&#803;-bak&#863;hs&#863;h (joy-giver) and
the other S&#257;ya-bak&#863;hs&#863;h (shade-giver)&mdash;they should
set up a piece of white stone (marble?) one gaz in length and
three-quarters of a gaz in breadth, and engrave my name thereon (and
those of my ancestors) up to T&#299;m&#363;r. It was set forth on the
other side that I had done away with the whole of the customs dues and
charges of Kabul, and whichever of my <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb108" href="#v1pb108" name="v1pb108">108</a>]</span>descendants and
successors should do anything contrary to this would be involved in the
wrath and displeasure of God. Up to the time of my accession these were
fixed and settled, and every year they took large sums on this account
from the servants of God (the Muhammadan people in general). The
abolition of this oppression was brought about during my reign. On this
journey to Kabul complete relief and contentment were brought about in
the circumstances of my subjects and the people of that place. The good
and leading men of G&#863;hazn&#299;n and that neighbourhood were
presented with robes of honour and dealt kindly with, and had their
desires excellently gratified.</p>
<p class="par">It is a strange coincidence that (the words)
<i>r&#363;z-i-panjs&#863;hanba
h&#299;z&#863;hdaham-i-&#7778;afar</i>,<a class="noteref" id=

18th &#7778;afar, which is the date of my entry into Kabul, give the
Hijra date thereof.</p>
<p class="par">I ordered them to inscribe this date on the stone. Near
a seat (<i>tak&#863;ht</i>) on the slope of a hill to the south of the
city of Kabul, and which is known as Tak&#863;ht-i-s&#863;h&#257;h,
they have made a stone terrace where Fird&#363;s-mak&#257;n&#299;
(B&#257;bar) used to sit and drink wine. In one corner of this rock
they have excavated a round basin which could contain about two
Hindustani maunds of wine. He caused his own blessed name with the date
to be carved on the wall of the terrace which is next to the hill. The
wording is, &ldquo;The seat of the king, the asylum of the world,
Z&#804;ah&#299;ru-d-d&#299;n Muh&#803;ammad B&#257;bar, son of
&#703;Umar S&#863;haik&#863;h G&#363;rg&#257;n, may God perpetuate his
kingdom, 914 (1508&ndash;9).&rdquo; I also ordered them to cut out of
stone another throne parallel <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb109"
href="#v1pb109" name="v1pb109">109</a>]</span>to this, and dig another
basin of the same fashion on its side, and engrave my name there,
together with that of &#7778;&#257;h&#803;ib-qir&#257;n&#299;
(T&#299;m&#363;r). Every day that I sat on that throne I ordered them
to fill both of the basins with wine and give it to the servants who
were present there. One of the poets of Ghaznin found the date of my
coming to Kabul in this chronogram&mdash;&ldquo;The king of the cities
of the seven climes&rdquo; (1016). I gave him a dress of honour and a
present, and ordered them to engrave this date on the wall near the
aforesaid seat. Fifty thousand rupees were given to Parw&#299;z;
Waz&#299;r-al-mulk was made Mir Bakhshi. A firman was sent to
Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n to despatch 170,000 rupees from the Lahore
treasury for expenses of the army at Qandahar. After visiting the
K&#863;hiy&#257;b&#257;n (avenue) of Kabul and the B&#299;b&#299;
M&#257;h-r&#363;, I ordered the governor of that city to plant other
trees in the place of those cut down by H&#803;usain Beg
R&#363;-siy&#257;h (the black-faced). I also visited the
&#362;lang-y&#363;rt of Ch&#257;l&#257;k and found it a very pleasant
place. The Ra&rsquo;is of Chikr&#299; (Jigr&#299;?) shot with an arrow
a <i>rang</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e3238src" href="#xd24e3238"
name="xd24e3238src">47</a> and brought it to me. Up to this time I had
never seen a rang. It is like a mountain goat, and there is a
difference only in its horns. The horns of the rang are bent, and those
of the goat are straight and convoluted.</p>
<p class="par">In connection with the account of Kabul the commentaries
of B&#257;bar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3243src" href="#xd24e3243"
name="xd24e3243src">48</a> passed in view before me. These were in his

"xd24e3248src">49</a>) that I wrote myself. At the end of the said
sections a sentence was written by me also in the Turk&#299; character,
so that it might be known that these four sections were written by me
in my own hand. Notwithstanding that I grew up in Hindustan, I am not
ignorant of Turk&#299; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb110" href=

"xd24e3256src">50</a> On the 25th &#7778;afar I with the people of the
harem visited the <i>julg&#257;h</i> (plain) of Saf&#299;d-sang, a very
bright and enjoyable place. On Friday, the 26th, I enjoyed the blessing
of a pilgrimage to (the tomb of) H.M. Fird&#363;s-mak&#257;n&#299;
(B&#257;bar). I ordered much money and food, bread, and sweetmeats for
the souls of the departed to be distributed to faqirs. Ruqayya
Sult&#804;&#257;n Begam, daughter of M&#299;rz&#257; Hind&#257;l, had
not performed a pilgrimage to her father&rsquo;s tomb, and on that day
had the honour to do so. On Thursday, 3rd Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal, I
ordered them to bring my racehorses (<i>&#257;sp&#257;n-i-dawanda</i>)
to the K&#863;hiy&#257;b&#257;n (avenue). The princes and the Amirs
raced them. A bay Arab horse, which &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n,
the ruler of the Deccan, had sent to me, ran better than all the other
horses. At this time the son of M&#299;rz&#257; Sanjar Haz&#257;ra and
the son of M&#299;rz&#257; M&#257;s&#863;h&#299;, who were the chief
leaders of the Haz&#257;ras, came to wait on me. The Haz&#257;ras of
the village of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb111" href="#v1pb111"
name="v1pb111">111</a>]</span>M&#299;rd&#257;d produced before me two
rangs<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3277src" href="#xd24e3277" name=
"xd24e3277src">51</a> that they had killed with arrows. I had never
seen a rang of this size; it was larger by 20 per cent. than a large
<i>m&#257;rk&#863;h&#363;r</i> (?).</p>
<p class="par">News came that S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, the
governor of Qandahar, had reached the parganah of S&#863;hor,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3285src" href="#xd24e3285" name=
"xd24e3285src">52</a> which is his jagir. I determined to give Kabul to
him and return to Hindustan. A petition came from R&#257;ja
B&#299;rsing-deo that he had made a prisoner of his nephew, who had
been creating a disturbance and had killed many of his men. I ordered
him to send him to the fort of Gwalior to be imprisoned there. The
parganah of Gujr&#257;t<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3288src" href=
"#xd24e3288" name="xd24e3288src">53</a> in the Panjab Sark&#257;r I
bestowed on S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n, the Afghan. I promoted
Ch&#299;n Qil&#299;j, son of Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, to the rank of
800 personal and 500 horse. On the 12th I sent for K&#863;husrau and
ordered them to take the chains off his legs that he might walk in the
S&#863;hahr-&#257;r&#257; garden. My fatherly affection would not
permit me to exclude him from walking in the aforesaid garden. I
transferred the fort of Attock and that neighbourhood from Ah&#803;mad
Beg to Z&#804;afar K&#863;h&#257;n. To Taj K&#863;h&#257;n, who was
nominated to beat back the Afghans of Bangas&#863;h, I gave 50,000
rupees. On the 14th I gave &#703;Al&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n
Ka&#7771;or&#299;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3294src" href=
"#xd24e3294" name="xd24e3294src">54</a> who was one of my revered
father&rsquo;s old servants and was the <i>d&#257;rog&#863;ha</i> of
the Naq&#257;rak&#863;h&#257;na (drum-house), the title of Naubat
K&#863;h&#257;n, and promoted him to the rank of 500 personal and 200
horse. I made R&#257;m D&#257;s <i>&#257;t&#257;l&#299;q</i> to
Mah&#257; Singh, grandson of R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh, who had also
been nominated to drive back the rebels of Bangas&#863;h. On Friday,
the 18th, the <i>wazn-i-qamar&#299;</i> (the weighing according to the
lunar year) for my 40th year took place. On that day the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb112" href="#v1pb112" name=
"v1pb112">112</a>]</span>assembly was held when two watches of the day
had passed. I gave 10,000 rupees of the money of the weighing to ten of
my confidential servants to divide amongst those who deserved it and
the needy. On this day a petition came from Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of Qandahar, by way of Haz&#257;ra and
G&#863;hazn&#299;n, in twelve days; its purport was that the ambassador
of S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s, who had started for the Court, had
entered the Haz&#257;ra<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3309src" href=
"#xd24e3309" name="xd24e3309src">55</a> (country). The Shah had written
to his own people: &ldquo;What seeker of occasion and raiser of strife
has come against Qandahar without my order? Perhaps he does not know
what is our connection with H.M. Sult&#804;&#257;n T&#299;m&#363;r, and
especially with Hum&#257;y&#363;n and his glorious descendants. If they
by chance should have taken the country into their possession they
should hand it to the friends and servants of my brother
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h and return to their own
abodes.&rdquo; I determined to tell S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n
to secure the Ghaznin road in such a way that travellers from Qandahar
might reach Kabul with ease. At the same time I appointed
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n to the &#7778;ad&#257;rat of
the province of Malwah and Ujjain. The son of M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;dm&#257;n Haz&#257;ra and grandson of Qar&#257;cha
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of the influential Amirs of
Hum&#257;y&#363;n, waited on me. Qar&#257;cha K&#863;h&#257;n had
married a woman from the Haz&#257;ra tribe, and this son<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3312src" href="#xd24e3312" name=

R&#257;n&#257; S&#863;hankar, son of R&#257;n&#257; &#362;day Singh,
was promoted to the rank of 2,500 personal and 1,000 horse. An order
was given for the rank of 1,000 personal and 600 horse for R&#257;y
Manohar. The S&#863;hinw&#257;r&#299; Afghans brought a mountain ram
the two horns of which had become one and had become like a
rang&rsquo;s horns. The same Afghans killed and brought <span class=

translates this &lsquo;a serpent-eating goat&rsquo;), the like of which
I had never seen or imagined. I ordered my artists to paint him. He
weighed four Hindustani maunds; the length of his horns was 1&frac12;
gaz.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3321src" href="#xd24e3321" name=
"xd24e3321src">57</a> On Sunday, the 27th, I gave the rank of 1,500
personal and 1,000 horse to S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n,
and the <i>h&#803;aw&#299;l&#299;</i> (district surrounding) of Gwalior
was placed in the jagir of I&#703;tib&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n. I
appointed Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; &#703;Izzatu-llah with his brothers to
the Bangas&#863;h duty. At the end of the same day a petition came to
me from Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n from Agra, together with a letter
which Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n had written to him
from Bihar. Its purport was that on the 3rd &#7778;afar (30th May,
1607), after the first watch, &#703;Al&#299; Qul&#299;
Ist&#257;jl&#363; had wounded Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n at
Bardwan, in the province of Bengal, and that he had died when two
watches of the same night had passed. The details of this matter are
that the aforesaid &#703;Al&#299; Qul&#299; was <i>sufrach&#299;</i>
(table servant) to S&#863;h&#257;h Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l (the 2nd),
ruler of Iran; after his death he took to flight through his natural
wickedness and habit of making mischief, and came to Qandahar, and
having met at Multan the K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, who had
been appointed to the charge of the province of Tulamba,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3333src" href="#xd24e3333" name=
"xd24e3333src">58</a> started with him for that province. The
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n in the field<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e3336src" href="#xd24e3336" name="xd24e3336src">59</a> placed
him among the servants of the late king (Akbar), and he having
performed services in that campaign was promoted to a rank in
accordance with his condition, and was a long time in the service of my
revered father. At the time when he (Akbar) went in prosperity to the
provinces of the Deccan, and I was ordered against the R&#257;n&#257;,
he came and became servant to me. I gave him the title of
S&#863;h&#299;r-afgan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb114" href=
"#v1pb114" name="v1pb114">114</a>]</span>(tiger-throwing). When I came
from Allahabad to wait on my revered father, on account of the
unfriendliness that was shown me, most of my attendants and people were
scattered abroad, and he also at that time chose to leave my service.
After my accession, out of generosity I overlooked his offences, and
gave an order for a jagir for him in the Subah of Bengal. Thence came
news that it was not right to leave such mischievous persons there, and
an order went to Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n to send him to
Court, and if he showed any futile, seditious ideas, to punish him. The
aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n had reason to know him (his character), and
with the men he had present, immediately the order arrived, went
hastily to Bardwan, which was his jagir. When he
(S&#863;h&#299;r-afgan) became aware of the arrival of
Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n, he went out to receive him
alone with two grooms. After he arrived and entered into the midst of
his army (his camp) the aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n surrounded him. When
from this proceeding on the part of Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n
K&#863;h&#257;n a doubt arose in his mind, he by way of deceiving him
said: &ldquo;What proceeding is this of thine?&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e3344src" href="#xd24e3344" name="xd24e3344src">60</a> The
aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n, keeping back his own men, joined him alone
in order to explain the purport of the order to him. Seeing his
opportunity he immediately drew his sword and inflicted two or three
severe wounds upon him. Amba K&#863;h&#257;n Kas&#863;hm&#299;r&#299;,
who was descended from the rulers of Kashmir and was connected (by
marriage?) with the aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n, and had a great regard
for him by way of loyalty and manliness, rushed forward and struck a
heavy blow on &#703;Al&#299; Qul&#299;&rsquo;s head, and that vicious
fellow inflicted a severe wound on Amba K&#863;h&#257;n with the point
of his sword.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3353src" href="#xd24e3353"
name="xd24e3353src">61</a> When they saw Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n

"#v1pb115" name="v1pb115">115</a>]</span>state, his men attacked him
(S&#863;h&#299;r-afgan), and cut him in pieces and sent him to hell. It
is to be hoped that the place of this black-faced scoundrel will always
be there. Amba K&#863;h&#257;n obtained martyrdom on the spot, and
Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n Koka after four watches attained
the mercy of God in his quarters. What can I write of this
unpleasantness? How grieved and troubled I became!
Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n Koka was to me in the place of a
dear son, a kind brother, and a congenial friend. What can one do with
the decrees of God? Bowing to destiny I adopted an attitude of
resignation. After the departure of the late King and the death of that
honoured one, no two misfortunes had happened to me like the death of
the mother of Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n Koka and his own
martyrdom.</p>
<p class="par">On Friday, the 6th Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-&#257;k&#863;hir,
I came to the quarters of K&#863;hurram (S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n),
which had been made in the &#362;rta Garden. In truth, the building is
a delightful and well-proportioned one. Whereas it was the rule of my
father to have himself weighed twice every year, (once) according to
the solar and (once according to the) lunar year, and to have the
princes weighed according to the solar year, and moreover in this year,
which was the commencement of my son K&#863;hurram&rsquo;s 16th lunar
year, the astrologers and astronomers<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3362src" href="#xd24e3362" name="xd24e3362src">62</a> represented
that a most important epoch according to his horoscope would occur, as
the prince&rsquo;s health<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3365src" href=
"#xd24e3365" name="xd24e3365src">63</a> had not been good, I gave an
order that they should weigh him according to the prescribed rule,
against gold, silver, and other metals, which should be divided among
faqirs and the needy. The whole of that day was passed in enjoyment and
pleasure in the house of B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram, and many of his
presents were approved. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb116" href=

<p class="par">As I had experienced the excellencies of Kabul, and had
eaten most of its fruits, in consequence of important considerations
and the distance from the capital, on Sunday, the 4th
Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal, I gave an order that they should send out the
advance camp in the direction of Hindustan. After some days I left the
city, and the royal standards proceeded to the meadow of
Saf&#299;d-sang. Although the grapes were not yet fully ripe, I had
often before this eaten Kabul grapes. There are many good sorts of
grapes, especially the &#7778;&#257;h&#803;ib&#299; and
Kis&#863;hmis&#863;h&#299;. The cherry also is a fruit of pleasant
flavour, and one can eat more of it than of other fruits; I have in a
day eaten up to 150 of them. The term
<i>s&#863;h&#257;h-&#257;l&#363;</i> means

<i>chalp&#257;sa</i> (lizard), my revered father called it
<i>s&#863;h&#257;h-&#257;l&#363;</i>. The <i>zard-&#257;l&#363;
paywand&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e3399src" href="#xd24e3399"
name="xd24e3399src">65</a> is good, and is abundant. There is
especially a tree in the S&#863;hahr-&#257;r&#257; garden, that
M&#299;rz&#257; Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;ak&#299;m, my uncle, planted, and
is known as the M&#299;rz&#257;&#702;&#299;. The apricots of this tree
are quite unlike the apricots of other trees. The peaches also are very
delicious and plentiful. They had brought some peaches from
Ist&#257;lif. I had them weighed in my presence, and they came exactly
in weight to 25 rupees, which is 68 current <i>mis&#804;q&#257;l</i>.
Notwithstanding the sweetness of the Kabul fruits, not one of them has,
to my taste, the flavour of the mango. The parganah of Mah&#257;ban was
given as jagir to Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n.
&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m, paymaster of the Ahadis, was promoted to
the rank of 700 personal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb117" href=

K&#863;h&#257;n Sarw&#257;n&#299; was appointed to the faujd&#257;rship
of the sarkar of H&#803;i&#7779;&#257;r. I ordered that M&#299;rz&#257;
Far&#299;d&#363;n Barl&#257;s should have a jagir in the Subah of
Allahabad. On the 14th of the aforesaid month I gave Ir&#257;dat
K&#863;h&#257;n, brother of &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, the rank
of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and presenting him with a special robe
of honour and a horse, bestowed on him the paymastership of the Subah
of Patna and H&#803;&#257;j&#299;p&#363;r. As he was my
<i>q&#363;rbeg&#299;</i>, I sent by his hand a jewelled sword for my
son (<i>farzand</i>) Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of the
aforesaid Subah. As we were going along I saw near &#703;Al&#299;
Masjid and G&#863;har&#299;b-k&#863;h&#257;na a large spider of the
size of a crab that had seized by the throat a snake of one and a half
gaz in length and half strangled it. I delayed a minute to look on at
this, and after a moment it died (the snake).</p>
<p class="par">I heard at Kabul that in the time of Mah&#803;m&#363;d
of Ghazni a person of the name of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
T&#257;b&#363;t<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3428src" href="#xd24e3428"
name="xd24e3428src">66</a> had died in the neighbourhood of
Z&#803;uh&#803;&#257;k and B&#257;miy&#257;n, and was buried in a cave,
whose limbs had not yet rotted asunder. This appeared very strange, and
I sent one of my confidential record writers with a surgeon to go to
the cave and, having seen the state of affairs as they were, to make a
special report. He represented that half of the body which was next the
ground had most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb118" href="#v1pb118"
name="v1pb118">118</a>]</span>of it come asunder, and the other half
which had not touched the ground remained in its own condition. The
nails of the hands and feet and the hair of the head had not been shed,
but the hair of the beard and moustache as far as one side of the nose
had been shed. From the date that had been engraved on the door of the
cave it appeared that his death had occurred before the time of
Sult&#804;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d. No one knows the exact state of
the case.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 15th Arsl&#257;n B&#299;, governor of
the fort of K&#257;hmard, who was one of the servants of middle rank
(?) of Wal&#299; Muh&#803;ammad K&#863;h&#257;n, ruler of
T&#363;r&#257;n, came and waited on me.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3435src" href="#xd24e3435" name="xd24e3435src">67</a> I had
always heard that M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;usain, son of
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h M&#299;rz&#257;, had been killed by the
&#362;zbegs. At this time a certain person came and presented a
petition in his name, and brought a ruby of the colour of an onion,
which was worth 100 rupees, as an offering. He prayed that an army
might be appointed to assist him, so that he might take Badakhshan out
of the &#362;zbegs&rsquo; hands. A jewelled dagger-belt was sent him,
and an order given that, as the royal standards had alighted in those
regions, if he really was M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;usain, son of
M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, he should first hasten into
my presence, so that having examined his petitions and claims I might
send him to Badakhshan. Two hundred thousand rupees were sent for the
army that had been sent with Mah&#257; Singh and R&#257;m D&#257;s
against the rebels of Bangash.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 22nd, having gone to the B&#257;l&#257;
H&#803;i&#7779;&#257;r, I inspected the buildings in that place. As the
place was not fit for me I ordered them to destroy these buildings and
to prepare a palace and a royal hall of audience. On the same day they
brought a peach from Ist&#257;lif, <i>bar&#257;bar sar-i-buh
bakal&#257;n&#299;</i>, &ldquo;as big as an owl&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb119" href="#v1pb119" name=

"xd24e3445src" href="#xd24e3445" name="xd24e3445src">68</a> I had not
seen a peach of such a size, and ordered it to be weighed, and it came
to 63 Akbar&#299; rupees, or 60 tolas. When I cut it in half its stone
also came into two pieces, and its substance was sweet. I had in Kabul
never eaten better fruit from any tree. On the 25th news came from
Malwa that M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h had bid farewell
to this transitory world, and God Almighty had submerged him in His
mercy. From the day on which he entered the service of my revered
father till the time of his departure, from no act of his could dust be
brought into the royal mind. He always did his duty with sincerity. The
aforesaid M&#299;rz&#257; apparently had four sons: H&#803;asan and
H&#803;usain were born of the same womb (i.e. they were twins).
H&#803;usain fled from Burhanpur and went by sea to Iraq, and thence to
Badakhshan, where they say he now is, as has been written about his
message and his sending some one to me. No one knows for certain
whether it is the same M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;usain, or the people of
Badakhshan have raised up this one like other false M&#299;rz&#257;s
and given him the name of M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;usain. From the time
when M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h came from Badakhshan and
had the good fortune to wait on my father until now, nearly 25 years
have passed. For some time the people of Badakhshan, on account of the
oppression and injury they have to undergo from the &#362;zbegs, have
given notoriety to a Badakhshan boy, who had on his face the marks of
nobility, as really the son of M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h and of the race of M&#299;rz&#257;
Sulaim&#257;n. A large number of the scattered &#362;ym&#257;qs, and
the hill-people of Badakhshan, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb120"
href="#v1pb120" name="v1pb120">120</a>]</span>whom they call
G&#863;harchal (Georgians?), collected round him, and showing enmity
and disputing with the &#362;zbegs, took some of the districts of
Badakhshan out of their possession. The &#362;zbegs attacked that false
M&#299;rz&#257; and captured him, and placing his head on a spear sent
it round to the whole country of Badakhshan. Again the seditious people
of Badakhshan quickly produced another M&#299;rz&#257;. Up to now
several M&#299;rz&#257;s have been killed. It appears to me that as
long as there is any trace of the people of Badakhshan they will keep
up this disturbance. The third son of the M&#299;rz&#257; is
M&#299;rz&#257; Sult&#804;&#257;n, who excels in appearance and
disposition all the other sons of the M&#299;rz&#257;. I begged him
from his revered father, and have kept him in my own service, and
having taken great pains with him reckon him as my own child. In
disposition and manners he has no likeness to his brothers. After my
accession I gave him the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, and
sent him to the Subah of Malwa, which was his father&rsquo;s place. The
fourth son is Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, whom he always had in
attendance on himself; he obtained the rank of 1,000 personal and 500
horse.</p>
<p class="par">While I was at Kabul, no <i>qamarg&#257;h</i> hunt had
taken place. As the time for returning to Hindustan had come near, and
I was very desirous of hunting red deer, I ordered them to go forward
as soon as possible and surround the hill Faraq,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3464src" href="#xd24e3464" name="xd24e3464src">69</a> which is
seven kos from Kabul. On Tuesday, the 4th Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal, I
went to hunt. Nearly 100 deer had come into the enclosure (qamargah).
About a half of these were taken, and a very hot hunt took place. I
gave 5,000 rupees in rewards to the ryots who were present at the hunt.
On the same day an increase of 500 horse was ordered to the rank of
S&#863;haik&#863;h <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb121" href=
"#v1pb121" name=
"v1pb121">121</a>]</span>&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;m&#257;n, son of
S&#863;haik&#863;h Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l, so as to bring it to 2,000
personal and (2,000) horse. On Thursday, the 6th, I went to the
throne-place of the late king B&#257;bar. As I was to leave Kabul on
the next day I looked on that day as a feast day, and ordered them to
arrange a wine-party on the spot, and fill with wine the little
reservoir they had cut in the rock. Cups were given to all the
courtiers and servants who were present, and few days have passed in
such enjoyment and pleasure. On Friday, the 7th, when a watch of day
had passed, leaving the city auspiciously and with pleasure, a halt was
made at the <i>julg&#257;h</i> (meadow) of the Saf&#299;d-sang. From
the S&#863;hahr-&#257;r&#257; as far as the julgah I scattered to
faqirs and poor people <i>darb</i> and <i>charan</i>, that is, half and
quarter rupees.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3479src" href="#xd24e3479"
name="xd24e3479src">70</a> On that day, when I mounted my elephant for
the purpose of leaving Kabul, the news arrived of the recovery of the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; and S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n. The
news of the good health of these two chief servants of mine I took as
an auspicious omen for myself. From the julgah of the Saf&#299;d-sang,
marching one kos on Tuesday, the 11th, I halted at Bikr&#257;m. I left
T&#257;s&#863;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n at Kabul to take proper care of
Kabul and neighbourhood until the coming of S&#863;h&#257;h Beg
K&#863;h&#257;n. On Tuesday, the 18th, I marched two and a half kos
from the halting-place of B&#363;tk&#863;h&#257;k by the road
D&#363;&#702;&#257;ba,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3482src" href=
"#xd24e3482" name="xd24e3482src">71</a> and encamped at a spring on the
bank of which there are four plane-trees. No one till now had looked to
the preparation of this halting-place, and they were ignorant of its
condition and suitability. It is in truth a most excellent spot, and
one fit to have a building erected in it. At this halting-place another
qamargah hunt took place, when about 112 deer, etc., were taken.
Twenty-four rang antelope and 50 red antelope and 16 mountain goats
were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb122" href="#v1pb122" name=
"v1pb122">122</a>]</span>taken. I had never till now seen a rang
antelope alive.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3487src" href="#xd24e3487"
name="xd24e3487src">72</a> It is in truth a wonderful animal of a
beautiful shape. Although the black buck of Hindustan looks very finely
made, the shape and fashion and appearance of this antelope is quite a
different thing. They weighed a ram and a rang; the ram came to a maund
and 33 seers and the rang to two maunds and 10 seers. The rang,
although of this size, ran so that ten or twelve swift dogs were worn
out and seized it with a hundred thousand difficulties. The flesh of
the sheep of the Barbary goat in flavour does not surpass that of the
rang. In the same village kulangs (demoiselle crane) were also
caught.</p>
<p class="par">Although K&#863;husrau had repeatedly done evil actions
and deserved a thousand kinds of punishment, my fatherly affection did
not permit me to take his life. Although in the laws of government and
the ways of empire one should take notice of such disapproved deeds, I
averted my eyes from his faults, and kept him in excessive comfort and
ease. It became known that he was in the habit of sending men to
scoundrels who did not consider consequences, and of inciting them to
give trouble and attempt my life, and making them hopeful with
promises. A band of these ill-fated ones of little foresight having
joined together, desired to attack me in the hunts that took place in
Kabul and those parts. As the grace and protection of God Almighty are
the guardians and keepers of this sublime dynasty, they did not attain
to their end. On the day when the halt was at the Surk&#863;h&#257;b,
one of that band went at the risk of his life to K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Wais&#299;, the D&#299;w&#257;n of my son K&#863;hurram, and revealed
that nearly 500 men at K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s instigation had conspired
with Fath&#803;u-llah, son of H&#803;ak&#299;m Ab&#363;-l-fath&#803;,
N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n, son of G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n
&#703;Al&#299; &#256;&#7779;af-k&#863;h&#257;n, and S&#863;har&#299;f,
son of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah (N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s
father), and were awaiting an opportunity <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb123" href="#v1pb123" name="v1pb123">123</a>]</span>to carry out
the designs of the enemies and evil-wishers of the king.
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Wais&#299; told this to K&#863;hurram, and he in
great perturbation immediately told me. I gave K&#863;hurram the
blessing of felicity, and prepared to get hold of the whole set of
those short-sighted ones and punish them with various kinds of
punishment. Again, it came to my mind, as I was on the march, and the
seizure of these people would create a disturbance and confusion in the
camp,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3497src" href="#xd24e3497" name=
"xd24e3497src">73</a> to order the leaders of the disturbance and
mischief to be apprehended. I handed over Fath&#803;u-llah in
confinement to certain trusty men, and ordered capital punishment for
the other two wretches, with three or four of the chief among the
black-faced (conspirators). I had dignified Q&#257;sim &#703;Al&#299;,
who was one of the servants of the late king Akbar, after my accession
with the title of Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n. He always accused
Fath&#803;u-llah of a want of loyalty, and said things about him. One
day he said to Fath&#803;u-llah: &ldquo;At the time when K&#863;husrau
fled and the king pursued him, you said to me: &lsquo;The Panjab should
be given to K&#863;husrau and this quarrel cut short.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Fath&#803;u-llah denied this, and both resorted to oaths and curses (on
themselves). Ten or fifteen days had not passed after this altercation
when that hypocritical wretch was arrested, and his false oath did its
business.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 22nd Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal, the news
came of the death of the H&#803;ak&#299;m Jal&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n
Muz&#804;affar Ardist&#257;n&#299;, who was of a family of skill and
medicine and claimed to be a descendant of Galen. At all events he was
an unequalled healer. His experience added to his knowledge.<a class=

frequented the assemblies of S&#863;h&#257;h T&#804;ahm&#257;sp, and
the king recited this hemistich about him:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;We have a pleasant physician: come, let as all
be ill.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">H&#803;ak&#299;m &#703;Al&#299;, who was his
contemporary, exceeded him in skill. In short, in medical skill and
auspiciousness and rectitude and purity of method and disposition he
was perfect. Other physicians of the age could not compare with him. In
addition to his medical skill he had many excellencies. He had perfect
loyalty towards me. He built at Lahore a house of great pleasantness
and purity, and repeatedly asked me to honour it (with my presence). As
I was very fond of pleasing him I consented. In short, the aforesaid
H&#803;ak&#299;m, from his connection with me and being my physician,
had great skill in the management of affairs and business of the world,
so that for some time at Allahabad I made him Diwan of my
establishment. On account of his great honesty he was very exacting in
important business, and people were vexed at this method of proceeding.
For about twenty years he had ulcerated lungs, and by his wisdom
preserved in some measure his health. When he was talking he mostly
coughed so much that his cheek and eyes became red, and by degrees his
colour became blue. I often said to him: &ldquo;Thou art a learned
physician; why dost thou not cure thy own wounds?&rdquo; He represented
that wounds in the lungs were not of such a nature that they could be
cured. During his illness one of his confidential servants put poison
into some medicine he was in the habit of taking every day and gave it
to him. When he perceived this he took remedies for it. He objected
very much to be bled, although this was necessary. It happened that he
was going to the privy when his cough overcame him and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb125" href="#v1pb125" name=
"v1pb125">125</a>]</span>opened the wounds in his lungs. So much blood
poured out of his mouth and brain that he became insensible and fell,
and made a fearful cry. An <i>&#257;ft&#257;bach&#299;</i>
(ewer-bearer) becoming aware of this, came into the assembly-room, and
seeing him smeared with blood cried out: &ldquo;They have killed the
h&#803;ak&#299;m.&rdquo; After examining him it was seen that there was
no sign of wounds on his body, and that it was the same wound in the
lungs that had begun to flow. They informed Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n,
who was the Governor of Lahore, and he, having ascertained the true
state of the affair, buried him. He left no capable son.</p>
<p class="par">On the 24th, between the garden of Waf&#257; and
N&#299;mlah, a hunt took place, and nearly forty red antelope were
killed. A female panther (<i>y&#363;z</i>) fell into our hands in this
hunt. The zamindars of that place, Lag&#863;hm&#257;n&#299;s,
S&#863;h&#257;l&#299;, and Afghans, came and said that they did not
remember nor had they heard from their fathers that a panther had been
seen in that region for 120 years. A halt was made on the 2nd
Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-&#257;k&#863;hir, at the Waf&#257; Garden, and the
assembly for the solar weighing was held. On the same day Arsl&#257;n
B&#299;, an &#362;zbeg who was one of the Sardars and nobles of
&#703;Abdu-l-M&#363;min K&#863;h&#257;n, and was at that time governor
of the fort of K&#257;hmard, having left his fort, had the blessing of
waiting on me. As he had come from friendship and sincerity, I exalted
him with a special robe of honour. He is a simple &#362;zbeg, and is
fit to be educated and honoured. On the 4th of the month an order was
given that &#703;Izzat K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e3531src" href="#xd24e3531" name="xd24e3531src">76</a> of
Jal&#257;l&#257;b&#257;d, should make the hunting-ground of the Arzina
plain into a qamargah (ring-hunting ground). Nearly 300 animals were
captured, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb126" href="#v1pb126" name=

sheep), 55 <i>t&#363;g&#863;hl&#299;</i> (yaks?), 95 antelope
(<i>saf&#299;da</i>).</p>
<p class="par">As it was the middle of the day when I arrived at the
hunting-place and the air was very hot, the (<i>t&#257;z&#299;</i>)
Arabian dogs had been exhausted.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3557src"

was one who had been brought up by my father, the late king Akbar. In
himself he is a very brave man and energetic, so much so that
constantly in the time of my father he fought several single combats,
and in my own reign defended the fort of Qandahar from the hosts of the
ruler of Iran. It was besieged for a year before the royal army arrived
to his assistance. His manners towards his soldiers are those of an
Am&#299;r (nobleman, <i>umar&#257;y&#257;na</i>), and not according to
discipline (<i>qudrat</i>), especially towards those who have helped
him in battles or are with him in campaigns. He jokes much with his

of the R&#257;n&#257; and join him. &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n,
the governor of that place, being informed of this event went after
him, and having made him prisoner on the way, slew several of the
wretches who had joined with him. An order was given that Ihtim&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n should start from Agra and bring the M&#299;rz&#257; to
the court. On the 25th of the aforesaid month news came that Im&#257;m
Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, nephew of Wal&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, ruler
of M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr, had killed him who was called
M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;usain, who had been reported to be the son of
M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h. In truth, the killing of the
sons of M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h is like the killing
of the demons, as they say that from every drop of their blood demons
are produced. In the station of Dhaka, S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n,
the Afghan, whom when I left I had placed at Peshawar to guard the
Khaibar Pass, came and waited on me. He had made no default in
preserving and guarding the road. Z&#804;afar K&#863;h&#257;n, son of
Zain K&#863;h&#257;n Koka, had been appointed to move on the
Dal&#257;z&#257;k Afghans and the tribe of Khatur, who had perpetrated
all kinds of misdeeds in the neighbourhood of Attock and the Beas and
that vicinity. After performing that service and the conquest of those
rebels, who numbered about 100,000 houses, and sending them off towards
Lahore, he came and waited upon me at the same halting-place, and it
was evident that he had performed that service as it ought to have been
done. As the month of Rajab, corresponding with the Il&#257;h&#299;
month of &#256;b&#257;n, had arrived,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3599src" href="#xd24e3599" name="xd24e3599src">80</a> and it was
known that this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb128" href="#v1pb128"
name="v1pb128">128</a>]</span>was one of the months fixed for the lunar
weighing (<i>wazn-i-qamar&#299;</i>) of my father, I determined that
the value of all the articles which he used to order for his own
weighing in the solar and lunar years should be estimated, and that
what this came to should be sent to the large cities for the repose of
the soul of that enlightened one, and be divided amongst the
necessitous and the faqirs. The total came to 100,000 rupees, equal to
300 Ir&#257;q tum&#257;ns, and 300,000 of the currency of the people of
M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr.</p>
<p class="par">Trustworthy men divided that sum among the twelve chief
cities, such as Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Gujarat (Ahmadabad), etc. On
Thursday, the 3rd Rajab, I favoured with the title of
K&#863;h&#257;n-jah&#257;n my son (<i>farzand</i>) &#7778;al&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n, who is not less to me than my own sons, and ordered
that they should in all firmans and orders write of him as
K&#863;h&#257;n-jah&#257;n. A special robe of honour and a jewelled
sword were also given him. Also, having entitled S&#863;h&#257;h Beg
K&#863;h&#257;n K&#863;h&#257;n-daur&#257;n, I presented him with a
jewelled waist-dagger, a male elephant, and a special horse. The whole
of the sarkars of T&#299;rah, Kabul, Bangash, and the province of
Saw&#257;d (Swat) Bajaur, with the (task of) beating back the Afghans
of those regions, and a jagir and the faujd&#257;rship were confirmed
to him. He took leave from B&#257;b&#257; H&#803;asan Abd&#257;l. I
also ordered R&#257;m D&#257;s Kachhw&#257;ha to receive a jagir in
this province and to be enrolled among the auxiliaries of this Subah. I
conferred on Kis&#863;han Chand, son of the Mota (fat) R&#257;ja, the
rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. A firman was written to
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n (Sayyid Far&#299;d), governor of
Gujarat, that as the good conduct and excellence and abstemiousness of
the son of Miy&#257;n Waj&#299;hu-d-d&#299;n<a class="noteref" id=

reported to me, he should hand over to him from me a sum of money, and
that he should write and send me some of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

God which had been tested. If the grace of God should be with me I
would continually repeat<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3618src" href=
"#xd24e3618" name="xd24e3618src">82</a> them. Before this I had given
leave to Zafar K&#863;h&#257;n to go to B&#257;b&#257; H&#803;asan
Abd&#257;l to collect together game for sport. He had made a
<i>s&#863;h&#257;k&#863;hband</i> (literally a tying together of horns
or branches). Twenty-seven red deer and 68 white ones came into the
<i>s&#863;h&#257;k&#863;hband</i>. I myself struck with arrows 29
antelope, and Parw&#299;z and K&#863;hurram also killed some others
with arrows. Afterwards orders were given to the servants and courtiers
to shoot. K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n was the best shot, and in every
case of his striking an antelope the arrow penetrated through and
through.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3631src" href="#xd24e3631" name=
"xd24e3631src">83</a> Again, on the 14th of the month of Rajab, Zafar
K&#863;h&#257;n had arranged a qamargah at R&#257;walpind&#299;. I
struck with an arrow a red deer at a long distance, and was highly
delighted at the arrow striking him and his falling down. Thirty-four
red deer and 35 <i>qar&#257;-q&#363;yr&#363;g&#863;h</i> (black-tailed)
antelope, which in the Hindi language they call <i>chik&#257;ra</i>,
and two pigs were also killed. On the 21st another qamargah had been
arranged within three kos of the fort of Rohtas by the efforts and
exertions of Hil&#257;l K&#863;h&#257;n. I had taken with me to this
hunt those who were screened by the curtains of honour (the members of
the zan&#257;nah). The hunt was a good one and came off with great
<i>&eacute;clat</i>. Two hundred red and white antelope were killed.
Passing on from Rohtas, the hills of which contain these antelope,
there are in no place in the whole of Hindustan, with the exception of
Girjh&#257;k and Nandanah, red deer of this description. I ordered them
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb130" href="#v1pb130" name=
"v1pb130">130</a>]</span>to catch and keep some of them alive, in order
that possibly some of them might reach Hindustan for breeding purposes.
On the 25th another hunt took place in the neighbourhood of Rohtas. In
this hunt also my sisters and the other ladies were with me, and nearly
100 red deer were killed. It was told me that S&#863;hams
K&#863;h&#257;n, uncle of Jal&#257;l K&#863;h&#257;n<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e3648src" href="#xd24e3648" name="xd24e3648src">84</a> Gakkhar
who was in that neighbourhood, notwithstanding his great age took much
delight in hunting, such that young men had not so much enjoyment in
it. When I heard that he was well-disposed towards faqirs and dervishes
I went to his house, and his disposition and manners pleased me. I
bestowed on him 2,000 rupees, and the same sum on his wives and
children, with five other villages with large receipts by way of
livelihood for them, that they might pass their days in comfort and
contentment. On the 6th S&#863;ha&#703;ban, at the halting-place of
Chand&#257;lah, the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; came and waited on me. I
was greatly pleased at obtaining his society again, for all the
physicians, Hindu and Musulman, had made up their minds that he would
die. Almighty God in His grace and mercy granted him the honour of
recovery, in order that it might be known to such as do not recognize
His will that for every difficult ill, which those who look on the
outside of causes only may have given up as hopeless, there is One who
is powerful to provide a cure and remedy out of His own kindness and
compassion. On the same day R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e3651src" href="#xd24e3651" name="xd24e3651src">85</a> one of
the most considerable of the Rajput Amirs, ashamed on account of the
fault he had committed in the matter of K&#863;husrau, and who was
living at his home, came, and under the patronage of the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; obtained the good <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb131" href="#v1pb131" name="v1pb131">131</a>]</span>fortune of
waiting on me; his offences were pardoned. At the time that I left Agra
in pursuit of K&#863;husrau I had in full confidence left him in charge
of Agra, so that when the ladies (<i>mah&#803;alh&#257;</i>)<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3662src" href="#xd24e3662" name=
"xd24e3662src">86</a> should be sent for he might come with them. After
the ladies were sent for he went for two or three stages with them, and
in the village of Mathura, on merely hearing foolish tales, separated
from them, and went to his native place (Bikanir). He thought that as a
commotion had arisen he would see where the right road was. The
merciful God, who cherishes His servants, in a short time having
arranged that affair broke the rope of the alliance of those rebels,
and this betrayal of his salt remained a burden on his neck. In order
to please the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; I ordered the rank which he
formerly held to be confirmed to him, and his jagir to remain as it
was. I promoted Sulaim&#257;n Beg, who was one of my attendants from
the time when I was prince, to the title of Fid&#257;&#702;&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n. On Monday, the 12th, a halt was made at the garden of
Dil-&#257;m&#299;z, which is on the bank of the river Ravi. I waited on
my mother in this garden. M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;, who
had done approved service in command of the army at Qandahar, waited on
me, and I bestowed great favour on him.</p>
<p class="par">On Tuesday, the 13th, I auspiciously entered Lahore. The
next day M&#299;r K&#863;hal&#299;lu-llah, son of
G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n Muh&#803;ammad,
M&#299;rm&#299;r&#257;n, who was of the descendants of S&#863;h&#257;h
Ni&#703;matu-llah Wal&#299;, paid his respects.<a class="noteref" id=

reign of S&#863;h&#257;h T&#804;ahm&#257;sp there was no family of such
greatness in the whole country, for the sister of the Shah, by name
J&#257;nish Begam, was in the house of (married to) M&#299;r
Ni&#703;matu-llah, the father of the M&#299;rm&#299;r&#257;n.

in marriage to his own son Isma&#703;&#299;l M&#299;rz&#257;, and
making the sons of that M&#299;rm&#299;r&#257;n sons-in-law, gave his
younger daughter to his eldest son, who had the same name as his
grandfather, and connected (in marriage) the daughter of
Isma&#703;&#299;l M&#299;rz&#257;, who was born of the niece of the
Shah, to another son, M&#299;r K&#863;hal&#299;lu-llah. After the death
of the Shah, by degrees the family went to decay, until in the reign of
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s they became all at once extirpated,
and they lost the property and effects that they had and could no
longer remain in their own place. M&#299;r K&#863;hal&#299;lu-llah came
to wait upon me. As he had undergone trouble on the road, and the signs
of sincerity were apparent from his circumstances, having made him a
sharer of my unstinted favours I gave him 12,000 rupees in cash, and
promoted him to the rank of 1,000 personal and 200 horse, and gave an
order for a jagir.</p>
<p class="par">An order was given to the civil department
(<i>d&#299;w&#257;niy&#257;n</i>) to confer the rank of 8,000 personal
and 5,000 horse on my son K&#863;hurram, and to provide a jagir for him
in the neighbourhood of Ujjain, and to assign the Sarkar of
H&#803;i&#7779;&#257;r F&#299;r&#363;za to him. On Thursday, the 22nd,
on the invitation of &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, I went with my
ladies to his house and passed the night there. The next day he
presented before me his own offerings, of the value of ten lacs of
rupees, in jewels and jewelled things, robes, elephants, and horses.
Some single rubies and jacinths and some pearls, also silk cloths with
some pieces of porcelain from China and Tartary, were accepted, and I
made a present of the rest to him. Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n
from Gujarat sent by way of offering a ring made of a single ruby of
good colour, substance, and water, the stone, the socket, and the ring
being all of one piece. They weighed 1&frac12; tanks and one surkh,
which is equal to one misqal and 15 surkh. This was sent to me and much
approved. Till that day no one had ever heard of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb133" href="#v1pb133" name=
"v1pb133">133</a>]</span>such a ring having come to the hands of any
sovereign. A single ruby weighing six surkhs or two tanks and 15
surkhs,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3679src" href="#xd24e3679" name=
"xd24e3679src">88</a> and of which the value was stated to be
&pound;25,000, was also sent. The ring was valued at the same
figure.</p>
<p class="par">On the same day the envoy of the Sharif of Mecca came to
wait on me with a letter and the curtain of the door of the
Ka&#703;bah. He showed great friendship towards me. The said envoy had
bestowed on him 500,000 <i>d&#257;m</i>, equal to 7,000 or 8,000
rupees, and I resolved to send the Sharif the equivalent of 100,000
rupees of the precious things of Hindustan. On Thursday, the 10th of
the month, a piece of the Subah of Multan was added to the jagir of
M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;, though the whole of the province
of Thattah had been given to him in jagir. He was also promoted to the
rank of 5,000 personalty and 5,000 horse. The government of Qandahar
and the protection of that region, which is the frontier of Hindustan,
were assigned to his excellent administration. Conferring on him a robe
of honour and a jewelled sword I gave him his leave. In fine,
M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; possessed perfection,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3715src" href="#xd24e3715" name=
"xd24e3715src">89</a> and he made also good verses. He used
Waq&#257;r&#299; as his <i>tak&#863;hallu&#7779;</i>, or poetic name
(R&#363;z-i-r&#363;shan, Bhopal 1297, p. 455; also
Ma&#702;&#257;s&#804;iru-l-umar&#257;, vol. iii, p. 347). This is one
of his couplets:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par">On the 15th the offering of the Khankhanan was presented
to me: 40 elephants, some jewelled and decorated vessels, some Persian
robes, and cloth that they make in the Deccan and those parts, had been
sent by him, altogether of the value of 150,000 rupees. M&#299;rz&#257;
Rustam and most of the office-holders of that Subah had also sent good
offerings. Some of the elephants were approved. News of the death of
R&#257;y Durg&#257;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3729src" href=
"#xd24e3729" name="xd24e3729src">90</a> who was one of those who had
been brought up by my revered father, arrived on the 18th of the month.
He had been in attendance for forty years and more in the position of
an Am&#299;r on my revered father, until, by degrees, he had risen in
rank to 4,000. Before he obtained the good fortune of waiting on my
father he was one of the trusted servants of R&#257;n&#257; &#362;day
Singh. He died on the 29th. He was a good military man.
Sult&#804;&#257;n S&#863;h&#257;h, the Afghan, whose disposition was
turbulent and mischievous, passed his time in the service of
K&#863;husrau, and had his complete intimacy, so much so that this
rebel was the cause of the running away of that unfortunate one. After
the defeat and capture of K&#863;husrau he went off alone(?)<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3732src" href="#xd24e3732" name=
"xd24e3732src">91</a> into the skirts of the hills of
K&#863;hiz&#803;r&#257;b&#257;d and that region. At last he was made
prisoner by M&#299;r Mug&#863;hal, the <i>karor&#299;</i> of that
place. As he had been the cause of the destruction and ruin of such a
son, I ordered them to shoot him with arrows on the plain of Lahore.
The aforesaid <span class="corr" id="xd24e3743" title=
"Source: karori">karor&#299;</span> was promoted to higher rank, and
was dignified with a grand dress of honour. On the 29th S&#863;h&#299;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, the Afghan, who was one of my old servants, died. One
might say that he took his own life, because he was continually
drinking wine, to the extent that in every watch he used to drink four
brimming cups of arrack of double strength. He had broken the fast of
the Ramaz&#803;&#257;n of the past year, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb135" href="#v1pb135" name="v1pb135">135</a>]</span>and took it
into his head this year that he would fast in the month of
Sha&#703;b&#257;n on account of his having broken the fast of
Ramaz&#803;&#257;n, and would fast for two months together. In
abandoning his usual custom, which is a second nature, he became weak
and his appetite left him, and becoming very weak he passed away in his
57th year. Patronising his children and brothers according to their
circumstances, I bestowed on them a portion of his rank and jagir.</p>
<p class="par">On the 1st of the month of S&#863;haww&#257;l I went to
visit Maul&#257;n&#257; Muh&#803;ammad Am&#299;n, who was one of the
disciples of S&#863;haik&#863;h Mah&#803;m&#363;d Kam&#257;ngar (the
bow-maker). The S&#863;haik&#863;h Mah&#803;m&#363;d<a class="noteref"

mentioned was one of the great men of his age, and H.M.
Hum&#257;y&#363;n had entire reliance on him, so much so that he once
poured water on his hands. The aforesaid Maul&#257;n&#257; is a man of
good disposition, and is free, notwithstanding the attachments and
accidents (of the world), a faqir in manner and ways, and acquainted
with brokenness of spirit. His company pleased me exceedingly. I
explained to him some of the griefs that had entangled themselves in my
mind and heard from him good advice and agreeable words, and found
myself greatly consoled at heart. Having presented him with 1,000
<i>b&#299;gh&#257;</i> and 1,000 rupees in cash by way of maintenance,
I took leave. One watch of day had passed on Sunday when I left Lahore
on my way to the capital of Agra. Having made Qil&#299;j
K&#863;h&#257;n governor, M&#299;r Qaw&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n diwan,
S&#863;haik&#863;h Y&#363;suf bakhshi, and Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n
kotwal, and presented each according to his circumstances with dresses
of honour, I turned towards my desired way. On the 25th, having passed
over the river at Sult&#804;anp&#363;r, I proceeded two kos and halted
at Nakodar. My revered father had given <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

rupees to build an embankment between these two parganahs and prepare a
waterfall, and in truth I found a halting-place exceedingly pleasant
and fresh. I ordered Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk, the jagirdar of Nakodar, to
erect a building and prepare a garden on one side of this embankment,
so that wayfarers seeing it might be pleased. On Saturday, 10th
Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da, Waz&#299;ru-l-mulk, who before my ascension
had the good fortune to serve me, and was Diwan of my establishment,
died of diarrh&oelig;a. At the end of his life a son of evil fortune
(lit footsteps) had been born in his house, who in the space of forty
days ruined<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3761src" href="#xd24e3761" name=
"xd24e3761src">94</a> (Erskine has &lsquo;ate&rsquo;) both his father
and mother, and who himself died when he was two or three years old. It
occurred to me that the house of Waz&#299;ru-l-mulk must not all at
once be ruined, and patronising Man&#7779;&#363;r, his brother&rsquo;s
son, I gave him rank. Indeed,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3773src" href=
"#xd24e3773" name="xd24e3773src">95</a> he showed no love to me (the
scent of love did not come from him). On Monday, the 14th, I heard on
the road that between Panipat and Karnal there were two tigers that
were giving much trouble to wayfarers. I collected the elephants and
sent them off. When I arrived at their (the tigers&rsquo;) place I
mounted a female elephant, and ordered them to place the elephants
round them after the manner of a qamargah (enclosure), and by the
favour of Allah killed both with a gun, and thus got rid of the raging
tigers that had closed the road to the servants of God. On Thursday,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb137" href="#v1pb137" name=

alighted at the residence which Sal&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n, the Afghan,
had made in the days of his rule in the middle of the river Jumna and
called Sal&#299;mga&#7693;h. My revered father had given the place to
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, who was originally an inhabitant of
Delhi. The aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n had built on the margin of the

building<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3781src" href="#xd24e3781" name=

when the late king Hum&#257;y&#363;n honoured Delhi with his presence,
he often sat there with his intimates, and associated with the members
of his assemblies. I passed four days in that place, and with my
courtiers and intimates enjoyed myself with wine parties.
Mu&#703;az&#804;z&#804;am K&#863;h&#257;n, who was governor of Delhi,
presented offerings. The jagirdars and citizens also made offerings and
presents, each according to his circumstances. I was desirous to employ
some days in a qamargah hunt in the parganah of P&#257;lam, which is
one of the places near the aforesaid city and one of the fixed
hunting-grounds. As it was represented to me that the (fortunate) hour
for approaching Agra had come very near, and another proper hour was
not to be obtained at all near that time, I gave up the intention, and
embarking on board a boat went on by water. On the 20th of the month of
Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da four boys and three girls, children of
M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, whom he had not mentioned to
my father, were brought. I placed the boys among my confidential
servants, and made over the girls to the attendants of the ladies of
the harem in order that they might look after them. On the 21st of the
same month R&#257;j&#257; M&#257;n Singh came and waited on me
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb138" href="#v1pb138" name=
"v1pb138">138</a>]</span>from the fort of Rohtas, which is in the
province of Patna and Behar, after orders had been sent to him six or
seven times. He also, like K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, is one of
the hypocrites and old wolves of this State. What they have done to me,
and what has happened to them from me, God the knower of secrets knows;
possibly no one could mention such another case(?). The aforesaid Raja
produced as offerings 100 elephants, male and female, not one of which
was fit to be included among my private elephants. As he was one of
those who had been favoured by my father, I did not parade his offences
before his face, but with royal condescension promoted him.</p>

Apparently the correct sum in rupees is 34 lakhs 25,000. At p. 61 the
khani of Turan is reckoned at one-third of a rupee. If the dam be taken
at its ordinary value of one-fortieth of a rupee, the number of rupees
should be 40 lakhs 25,000, and if the khani of Turan be one-third of a
rupee we should read one kror instead of one arb. Probably
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r has used arb as meaning kror, and not 100 krors.
There is a valuable note on his expedition through the Ghakkar country
in Blochmann, p. 486. Blochmann takes the figures for the rupees to be

<i>arg&#863;hus&#863;htaq</i>, which is a kind of dance (not a
child&rsquo;s game as in Johnson). It is described in Vullers, s.v., in
accordance with the account in the Burh&#257;n-i-q&#257;t&#804;i&#703;.
It is a dance by girls or young men, and is accompanied with singing
and with clapping of hands, etc. Probably it is the dance described by
Elphinstone in his account of Kabul, i, 311, where he says: &ldquo;The
great delight of all the western Afghans is to dance the Attun or
Ghoomboor. From ten to twenty men or women stand up in a circle (in
summer before their houses and tents, and in winter round a fire); a
person stands within the circle to sing and play on some instrument.
The dancers go through a number of attitudes and figures; shouting,
clapping their hands, and snapping their fingers. Every now and then
they join hands, and move slow or fast according to the music, all
joining in chorus. When I was showed this, a love-song was sung to an
extremely pretty tune, very simple, and not unlike a Scottish
air.&rdquo; Erskine&rsquo;s translation is: &ldquo;Custards and
confections were presented, and the amusements of dancing girls and
arghustak were introduced.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Probably the sections which Jah&#257;ng&#299;r wrote were those printed
in the Ilminsky edition and which bring the narrative down to
B&#257;bar&rsquo;s death. They seem to have been in great measure
copied from the Akbar-n&#257;ma. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r does not say if he
wrote them when he was in Kabul or previously. According to Blochmann,
J.A.S.B. for 1869, p. 134, one <i>juz&#702;</i> = two sheets of paper.
The passage is translated in Elliot, vi, 315. Though Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
does not say when he wrote the four sections, I think that his language
implies that these additions were in the manuscript when he was looking
at it in Kabul. Perhaps he made them when he was a student in India,
and for the sake of practice in Turk&#299;. He may have translated the
sections from the Akbar-n&#257;ma. All, I think, he did in Kabul was to
put the Turk&#299; note, stating that the sections were his. But
possibly even this was done before. Elliot, vi, 315, has the words
&ldquo;to complete the work,&rdquo; but these words do not occur in the
MSS. that I have seen. The translation in Elliot, seems to represent
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s words as meaning that the work was complete,
but that the four sections were not, like the rest, in
B&#257;bar&rsquo;s handwriting, and so Jah&#257;ng&#299;r re-copied
them. But it does not appear that there could be any object in his
doing this. There is a valuable article in the <span lang=

141, by Dr. Teufel, entitled &ldquo;<span lang="de">B&acirc;bur und

Perhaps <i>s&#863;has&#863;h-g&#363;s&#863;ha</i>,
&lsquo;hexagonal,&rsquo; was intended. This view is confirmed by the
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, p. 31, which has <i>s&#863;has&#863;h
pahl&#363;</i>, &lsquo;six-sided.&rsquo; Erskine&rsquo;s MS. also had
&lsquo;six-sided,&rsquo; and he translates &ldquo;a six-sided ruby
which weighed two <i>tangs</i> fifteen <i>surkhs</i>.&rdquo; I.O. MS.
305 has <i>s&#863;has&#863;h p&#257;rcha</i>, and it is evident that
this word, as also the <i>barja</i> of No. 181, is the
<i>p&#257;rche</i> of Steingass, which means a segment or

Accession.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On Thursday, the 2nd Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja,
corresponding with the 1st Farward&#299;n (19th March, 1608), the Sun,
which enlightens and heats the world with its splendour, changed from
the constellation of Pisces to the joyful mansion of Aries, the abode
of pleasure and rejoicing. It gave the world fresh brightness, and
being aided by the Spring clothed those who had been plundered by the
cold season, and tyrannised over by the Autumn, with the robes of
honour of the New Year and the garments of emerald green, and gave them
compensation and recuperation.</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="par">The feast of the New Year was held in the village of
Rankatta,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3830src" href="#xd24e3830" name=
"xd24e3830src">1</a> which is five kos off (from Agra), and at the time
of transit (of the sun) I seated myself on the throne with glory and
gladness. The nobles and courtiers and all the servants came forward
with their congratulations. In the same assembly I bestowed on
K&#863;h&#257;njah&#257;n the rank of 5,000 personal and horse. I
selected K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n for the post of bakhshi.
Dismissing Waz&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n from the Viziership of the
province of Bengal, I sent in his place Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan
S&#863;hih&#257;bk&#863;h&#257;n&#299;; and N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n
Qul&#299; became kotwal of Agra. As the glorious mausoleum of the late
king Akbar was on the road, it entered my mind that if in passing by I
should have the good fortune of a pilgrimage to it, it might occur to
those who were short-sighted that I visited it because it was the place
where my road crossed. I accordingly had determined that this time I
would enter Agra, and after that would go on foot on this pilgrimage to
the shrine, which is two and a half kos off, in the same way that the
H&#803;az&#803;rat (my father), on account of my birth, had gone from
Agra to Ajmir. Would that I might also traverse the same on my head!
When two watches of day had passed of Saturday, the 5th<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3833src" href="#xd24e3833" name="xd24e3833src">2</a>
of the month, at an auspicious hour, I returned towards Agra, and
scattering with two hands 5000 rupees in small coins on the way,
entered the august palace which was inside the fort. On this day
R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo brought a white cheeta to show me.
Although other sorts <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb140" href=
"#v1pb140" name="v1pb140">140</a>]</span>of creatures, both birds and
beasts, have white varieties, which they call
<i>t&#804;&#363;yg&#863;h&#257;n</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3841src" href="#xd24e3841" name="xd24e3841src">3</a> I had never
seen a white cheeta. Its spots, which are (usually) black, were of a
blue colour, and the whiteness of the body was also inclined to
bluishness. Of the albino animals that I have seen there are falcons,
sparrow-hawks, hawks (<i>s&#863;hikara</i>) that they call
<i>b&#299;g&#363;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e3855src" href=
"#xd24e3855" name="xd24e3855src">4</a> in the Persian language,
sparrows, crows, partridges, florican, <i>podna</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd24e3868src" href="#xd24e3868" name="xd24e3868src">5</a>
(<i>Sylvia olivacea</i>), and peacocks. Many hawks in aviaries are
albinos. I have also seen white flying mice (flying squirrels) and some
albinos among the black antelope, which is a species found only in
Hindustan. Among the <i>chik&#257;ra</i> (gazelle), which they call
<i>saf&#299;da</i> in Persia, I have frequently seen albinos. At this
time Ratan, son of Bhoj-h&#257;ra, who is one of the chief Rajput
nobles, came to the camp and waited on me, bringing three elephants as
an offering. One of these was much approved, and they valued it in the
office at 15,000 rupees. It was entered among my private elephants, and
I gave it the name of Ratangaj. The value of elephants of the former
great Rajas of India was not more than 25,000 rupees, but they have now
become very dear. I dignified Ratan with the title of Sarbuland
R&#257;y. I promoted M&#299;r&#257;n &#7778;adr Jah&#257;n to the rank
of 5,000 personal and 1,500 horse and Mu&#703;az&#804;z&#804;am
K&#863;h&#257;n to 4,000 personal and 2,000 horse. &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n was promoted to 3,000 and 500 horse. Muz&#804;affar
K&#863;h&#257;n and Bh&#257;o Singh each obtained the rank of 2,000
personal and 1,000 horse. Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan diwan had 1,000 and
500 horse. I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah that of 1,000 personal and 250
horse. On the 25th R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh, the maternal uncle of my
son K&#863;hurram, came and paid his respects to me. He brought with
him Shy&#257;m, the cousin of the turbulent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb141" href="#v1pb141" name=
"v1pb141">141</a>]</span>Umr&#257;. In truth he possesses some skill
and understands well how to ride elephants. R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh
had brought with him a poet who wrote verse in the Hindi tongue. He
laid before me a poem in my praise to the purport that if the Sun had a
son it would be always day and never would be night, because after his
setting that son would sit in his place and keep the world in light.
Praise and thanksgiving to God that God gave your father such a son
that after his death men should not wear mourning which is like the
night. The Sun had envy on this account, saying, &ldquo;Would I might
also have a son who, taking my place, should not allow night to
approach the world, for from the light of your rising and the
illumination of your justice, notwithstanding such a misfortune, the
spheres are so bright that one might say &lsquo;night had neither name
nor sign.&rsquo;&rdquo; Few Hindi verses of such freshness of purport
have ever reached my ear. As a reward for this eulogy I gave him an
elephant. The Rajputs call a poet Ch&#257;ran (name of a caste who are
many of them poets). One of the poets of the age has turned<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3886src" href="#xd24e3886" name="xd24e3886src">6</a>

<p class="par first">On Thursday, the 8th Muh&#803;arram, 1017<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3908src" href="#xd24e3908" name="xd24e3908src">7</a>
(24th April, 1608), Jal&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n Mas&#703;&#363;d, who held
the rank of 400 personal and was not wanting in bravery, and who in
several battles had done great deeds, died at about the age of 50 or 60
years of diarrh&oelig;a. He was an opium-eater, and used to eat opium
after breaking it in pieces, like <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb142" href="#v1pb142" name="v1pb142">142</a>]</span>cheese, and it
is notorious that he frequently ate opium from the hand of his own
mother. When his disease became violent and there was a prospect of his
death, his mother from excessive love for him ate more opium than was
right out of that which she used to give her son, and two or three
hours after his death she also died. I have never heard of such
affection on the part of a mother for her son. It is the custom among
the Hindus that after the death of their husbands women burn
themselves, whether from love, or to save the honour of their fathers,
or from being ashamed before their sons-in-law, but nothing like this
was ever manifested on the part of mothers, Musulman or Hindu. On the
15th of the same month I presented my best horse by way of favour to
R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh. S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s had sent
this horse with some other horses and fitting gifts by Min&#363;chihr,
one of his confidential slaves, to the late king Akbar. From being
presented with this horse the Raja was so delighted that if I had given
him a kingdom I do not think he would have shown such joy. At the time
they brought the horse it was three or four years old. It grew up in
Hindustan. The whole of the servants of the Court, Moghul and Rajput
together, represented that no horse like this had ever come from Iraq
to Hindustan. When my revered father gave the province of Khandesh and
the Subah of the Deccan to my brother D&#257;niy&#257;l, and was
returning to Agra, he by way of kindness told D&#257;niy&#257;l to ask
of him whatever he desired. Seizing the opportunity, he asked for this
horse, and he accordingly gave it to him. On Tuesday, the 20th, a
report came from Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n with the news of the death
of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of the
Subah of Bengal, who was my special slave. On account of his natural
excellence and innate merit he had been enrolled in the list of the
great Amirs. I was much grieved at his death. I bestowed the rule of
Bengal and the tutorship <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb143" href=
"#v1pb143" name="v1pb143">143</a>]</span>to Prince Jah&#257;nd&#257;r

"#xd24e3917" name="xd24e3917src">8</a> Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n, and
in his place gave the government of the Subah of Behar to Afz&#803;al
K&#863;h&#257;n (son of Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l). The son of
H&#803;ak&#299;m &#703;Al&#299;, whom I had sent on some duties to
Burhanpur, came and brought with him some Karnatic jugglers who had no
rivals or equals; for instance, one of them played with ten balls, each
of which was equal to an orange and one to a citron, and one to a
<i>surk&#863;h</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3927src" href=
"#xd24e3927" name="xd24e3927src">9</a> in such a way that
notwithstanding some were small and some large he never missed one, and
did so many kinds of tricks that one&rsquo;s wits became bewildered. At
the same time a dervish from Ceylon came and brought a strange animal
called a <i>deonak</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e3935src" href=
"#xd24e3935" name="xd24e3935src">10</a> (or <i>devang</i>). Its face
was exactly like a large bat, and the whole shape was like that of a
monkey, but it had no tail. Its movements were like those of the black
tailless monkey which they call <i>ban m&#257;nus&#863;h</i> (jungle
man) in the Hindi language. Its body was like that of a young monkey
two or three months old. It had been with the dervish for five
years.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3956src" href="#xd24e3956" name=
"xd24e3956src">11</a> It appeared that the animal would never grow
larger. Its food is milk and it also eats plantains. As the creature
appeared very strange, I ordered the artists to take a likeness of it
in various kinds of movement. It looked very ugly.</p>
<p class="par">On the same day M&#299;rz&#257; Far&#299;d&#363;n
Barl&#257;s was promoted to the rank of 1,500 personal and 1,300 horse.
An order was given that P&#257;yanda<a class="noteref" id=

himself as a soldier, should receive a jagir equal to 2,000 personal.

at 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse. The guardianship of the fort of
Rohtas was bestowed on Kis&#863;hwar K&#863;h&#257;n, son of
Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n Koka. Ihtim&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n was raised to the rank of 1,000 personal and 300 horse,
and made <i>m&#299;r bah&#803;r</i> (admiral) and was appointed to the
charge of the <i>naw&#257;ra</i> (fleet) of Bengal. On the 1st
&#7778;afar S&#863;hamsu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n, son of
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, made an offering of ten elephants,
and, receiving the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, was selected
for the title of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, and
Z&#804;afar K&#863;h&#257;n received the rank of 2,000 personal and
1,000 horse. As I had demanded in marriage the daughter of Jagat Singh,
eldest son of R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh, I on the 16th sent 80,000
rupees for the <i>s&#257;chaq</i> (a marriage present) to the house of
the aforesaid Raja in order to dignify him. Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n
sent from the port of Cambay a European curtain (tapestry), the like of
which in beauty no other work of the Frank painters had ever been seen.
On the same day my aunt, Naj&#299;bu-n-nis&#257; Begam,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3982src" href="#xd24e3982" name=
"xd24e3982src">13</a> died in the 61st year of her age of the disease
of consumption and hectic fever. I promoted her son, M&#299;rz&#257;
W&#257;l&#299;, to the rank of 1,000 personal and 200 horse. A man of
M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr, of the name of Aqam
H&#803;&#257;j&#299;, who for a long time had been in Turkey and was
not without reasonableness and religious knowledge, and who called
himself the ambassador of the Turkish Emperor, waited upon me at Agra.
He had an unknown writing (? illegible letter). Looking to his
circumstances and his proceedings none of the servants of the Court
believed in his being an ambassador. When T&#299;m&#363;r conquered
Turkey, and Yildir&#299;m B&#257;yaz&#299;d, the ruler <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb145" href="#v1pb145" name=
"v1pb145">145</a>]</span>of that place, fell alive into his hands, he,
after levying tribute and taking one year&rsquo;s revenue, determined
to hand back into his possession the whole of the country of Turkey.
Just at that time Yildir&#299;m B&#257;yaz&#299;d died, and
(T&#299;m&#363;r), having handed over the kingdom to his son
M&#363;s&#257; Cheleb&#299;, returned. From that time until now,
notwithstanding such favours, no one had come on the part of the
emperors, nor has any ambassador been sent: how, then, can it now be
believed that this person from M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr should
have been sent by the emperor? I could in no way understand the affair,
and no one could bear witness to the accuracy of his claim: I therefore
told him to go wherever he might wish. On the 4th
Rab&#299;&#703;u-1-awwal the daughter of Jagat Singh entered the harem,
and the marriage ceremony was performed in the house of Her Highness
Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;. Amongst the things sent with her by R&#257;ja
M&#257;n Singh were 60 elephants.</p>
<p class="par">As I had determined to conquer the R&#257;n&#257;, it
occurred to me that I should send Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n. I
appointed 12,000 fully armed cavalry under able officers to go with
him, and in addition 500 ahadis, 2,000 musketeers on foot, with
artillery made up of 70 to 80 guns mounted on elephants and camels; 60
elephants were appointed to this duty. Two million rupees of treasure
were ordered to be sent with this army. On the 16th of the said month
M&#299;r K&#863;hal&#299;lu-llah, grandson of M&#299;r
Ni&#703;matu-llah Yazd&#299;, the whole of whose circumstances and
family history has already been written, died of diarrh&oelig;a. In his
appearance the traces of sincerity and dervishhood were
manifest<span class="corr" id="xd24e3989" title=

service he would have risen to high rank. The bakhshi of Burhanpur had
sent some mangoes, one of which I ordered to be weighed; it came to
52&frac12; tolas. On Wednesday, the 18th, in the house of
Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;, the feast of the lunar weighing of my 40th
year <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb146" href="#v1pb146" name=

to be divided amongst women and needy persons. On Thursday, the 4th
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-&#257;k&#863;hir, T&#804;&#257;hir Beg, the bakhshi
of the Ahadis, was given the title of Muk&#863;hli&#7779;
K&#863;h&#257;n, and Mull&#257;-i-Taqiyy&#257;

excellencies and perfections, and was well acquainted with the science
of history and genealogy, that of Mu&#702;arrik&#863;h K&#863;h&#257;n.
On the 10th of the same month, having given Bark&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;r,
the brother of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, the title of
Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n, I dignified him among his fellows.
M&#363;nis K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Mihtar K&#863;h&#257;n, presented me
with a jug of jasper (jade), which had been made in the reign of
M&#299;rz&#257; Ulug&#863;h Beg G&#363;rg&#257;n, in the honoured name
of that prince. It was a very delicate rarity and of a beautiful shape.
Its stone was exceedingly white and pure. Around the neck of the jar
they had carved the auspicious name of the M&#299;rz&#257; and the
Hijra year in <i>riq&#257;&#703;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3999src" href="#xd24e3999" name="xd24e3999src">15</a> characters.
I ordered them to inscribe my name and the auspicious name of Akbar on
the edge of the lip of the jar. Mihtar<a class="noteref" id=

K&#863;h&#257;n was one of the ancient slaves of this State. He had the
honour of serving the late king Hum&#257;y&#363;n, and during the reign
of my revered father had attained the rank of nobility. He regarded him
as one of his confidential servants. On the 16th a firman was issued
that the country of Sangr&#257;m,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4008src"
href="#xd24e4008" name="xd24e4008src">17</a> which had been given for a
year by way of reward to my son (<i>farzand</i>) Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, should be handed over for the same purpose for a year
to Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of the Subah of Behar. On
this day I promoted Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n to the rank of 3,000
personal and 2,500 horse, and Y&#363;suf K&#863;h&#257;n, son of
H&#803;usain K&#863;h&#257;n Tukriyah, obtained that of 2,000
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb147" href="#v1pb147" name=

leave to Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n and the Amirs and men who had
been appointed to subdue the R&#257;n&#257;. The aforesaid
K&#863;h&#257;n was honoured with a robe of honour, a horse, a special
elephant, and a jewelled sword. Zafar K&#863;h&#257;n, having been
honoured with a standard, was presented with a private robe of honour
and a jewelled dagger. S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n also
was presented with a standard, and I gave him a robe of honour and a
special elephant. R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo received a robe of
honour and a special horse, and Mangl&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n a horse and
jewelled dagger. Nar&#257;yan D&#257;s Kachhw&#257;hah, &#703;Al&#299;
Qul&#299; Darman, and Hizabr K&#863;h&#257;n Tahamtan obtained leave.
On Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n and Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk the bakhshi
jewelled daggers were conferred, and in the same manner all the Amirs
and leaders, each one according to his degree, were honoured with royal
gifts. A watch of the day had passed when the Khankhanan, who had been
selected for the high honour of my &#256;t&#257;l&#299;q (guardian),
came from Burhanpur and waited on me. Delight and happiness had so
overpowered him that he did not know whether he came on his head or his
feet. He threw himself bewildered at my feet. By way of favour and
kindness I lifted up his head and held it in an embrace of kindliness
and affection, and kissed his face. He brought me as offerings two
strings of pearls and some rubies and emeralds. The value of the jewels
was 300,000 rupees. Besides these he laid before me many valuable
things. On the 17th Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal Waz&#299;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, the Diwan of Bengal, came and waited on me, and
offered 60 elephants, male and female, and one Egyptian<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4016src" href="#xd24e4016" name=
"xd24e4016src">18</a> ruby. As he was one of the old servants and he
performed every duty, I ordered him to remain in attendance on me. As
Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n and his elder brother, Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, could in no way <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb148"
href="#v1pb148" name="v1pb148">148</a>]</span>keep the peace together,
I had sent for the former to my own presence, and he yesterday came and
waited on me. On the 22nd, &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, made me an
offering of a ruby of the weight of seven <i>&#7789;&#257;nk</i>, which
Ab&#363;-l-q&#257;sim, his brother, had bought in the port of Cambay
for 75,000 rupees. It is of a beautiful colour and well-shaped, but to
my belief is not worth more than 60,000 rupees. Great faults had been
committed by Dul&#299;p R&#257;y, son of R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh, but
as he took refuge with my <i>farzand</i> K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n his
offences were pardoned, and I knowingly and purposely passed over his
delinquencies. On the 24th the sons of
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, who had followed after him,
arrived and waited on me and produced as an offering the sum of 25,000
rupees. On the same day the said K&#863;h&#257;n offered 90 elephants.
On Thursday, the 1st Jum&#257;d&#257;-s&#804;-s&#804;&#257;n&#299;, the
feast of my solar year was celebrated in the house of
Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;. Some of the money I divided among the women,
and an order was given that the balance should be distributed to the
poor of the hereditary kingdoms. On the 4th of the month I ordered the
Diwans to give a jagir, according to his rank, of 7,000 rupees to
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am.</p>
<p class="par">On this day a female antelope in milk was brought that
allowed itself to be milked with ease, and gave every day four seers of
milk. I had never seen or heard of anything of the kind before. The
milk of the antelope, of the cow, and the buffalo in no way differs.
They say it is of great use in asthma. On the 11th of the month
R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh asked for leave to complete the army of the
Deccan to which he had been appointed, as well as to visit Amber, his
native place. I gave him a male elephant of my own called
Hus&#863;hy&#257;r-mast, and gave him leave. On Monday, the 12th, as it
was the anniversary of the death of the late king Akbar, in addition to
the expenses of that entertainment, which are fixed separately, I sent
4,000 rupees more to be divided among the faqirs and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb149" href="#v1pb149" name=
"v1pb149">149</a>]</span>dervishes who are present in the enlightened
mausoleum of the venerated one. On that day I exalted &#703;Abdu-llah,
the son of K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, with the title of
Sarfar&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n, and &#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m, son
of Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n, with that of Tarbiyat K&#863;h&#257;n.
On Tuesday, the 13th, I sent for K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s daughter, and
saw a child so like her father as no one can remember to have seen. The
astrologers used to say that her advent would not be auspicious to her
father, but would be auspicious to me. At last it became known that
they had augured rightly. They said that I should see her after three
years. I saw her when she had passed this age. On the 21st of the month
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n determined to clear out the
province of the Niz&#257;mu-l-mulk, into which, after the death of the
late king Akbar, some disturbances had found their way, and stated in
writing that &ldquo;If I do not complete this service in the course of
two years, I shall be guilty (of a fault), on the condition that in
addition to the force that had been allotted to that Subah 12,000 more
horse with 1,000,000 rupees should be sent with me.&rdquo; I ordered
that materials for the army and the treasure should be quickly
prepared, and he should be despatched. On the 26th Muk&#863;hli&#7779;
K&#863;h&#257;n, bakhshi of the ahadis, was appointed bakhshi of the
Subah of the Deccan, and I bestowed his place on Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
H&#803;usain K&#863;h&#257;n, the M&#299;r Bah&#803;r. On the 1st
Rajab, P&#299;s&#863;hrau K&#863;h&#257;n and Kam&#257;l
K&#863;h&#257;n, who belonged to the servants who were in constant
attendance on me (<i>r&#363;-s&#863;hin&#257;s</i>), died.
S&#863;h&#257;h Tahm&#257;sp had given P&#299;s&#863;hrau
K&#863;h&#257;n as a slave to my grandfather, and he was called
Sa&#703;&#257;dat. When he was promoted in the service of the late king
Akbar to the daroghahship and superintendence of the
<i>farr&#257;s&#863;hk&#863;h&#257;na</i> (carpet department), he
obtained the title of P&#299;s&#863;hrau. He was so well acquainted
with this service that one might say it was a garment they had sewn on
the stature of his capacity. When he was 90 years old he was quicker
than lads of 14. He had the good fortune <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb150" href="#v1pb150" name="v1pb150">150</a>]</span>to serve my
grandfather, my father, and me. Until he breathed his last he was never
for a moment without the intoxication of wine.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Besmeared with wine

</div>
<p class="par first">He left 1,500,000 rupees. He has one very stupid
son, called Ri&#703;&#257;yat. On account of his father&rsquo;s claims
for services performed, I gave the superintendence of half the
farrashkhana to him and the other half to Tuk&#863;hm&#257;q
K&#863;h&#257;n. Kam&#257;l K&#863;h&#257;n was one of the slaves
sincerely devoted to my service; he is of the caste of the Kal&#257;ls
of Delhi. On account of the great honesty and trustworthiness that he
had shown I made him <i>bak&#257;wal-beg&#299;</i> (chief of the
kitchen). Few such servants are ever met with. He had two sons, to both
of whom I showed great kindness, but where are there others like him?
On the 2nd of the said month La&#703;l<a class="noteref" id=

Kal&#257;want, who from his childhood had grown up in my father&rsquo;s
service, who had taught him every breathing and sound that appertains
to the Hindi language, died in the 65th or 70th year of his age. One of
his girls (concubines) ate opium on this event and killed herself. Few
women among the Musulmans have ever shown such fidelity.</p>
<p class="par">In Hindustan, especially in the province of
Sylhet,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4065src" href="#xd24e4065" name=
"xd24e4065src">22</a> which is a dependency of Bengal, it was the
custom for the people of those parts to make eunuchs of some of their
sons and give them to the governor in place of revenue
(<i>m&#257;l-w&#257;jib&#299;</i>). This custom by degrees has been
adopted in other provinces, and every year some children are thus
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb151" href="#v1pb151" name=
"v1pb151">151</a>]</span>ruined and cut off from procreation. This
practice has become common. At this time I issued an order that
hereafter no one should follow this abominable custom, and that the
traffic in young eunuchs should be completely done away with.
Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n and the other governors of the Subah of
Bengal received firmans that whoever should commit such acts should be
capitally punished, and that they should seize eunuchs of tender years
who might be in anyone&rsquo;s possession. No one of the former kings
had obtained this success. Please Almighty God, in a short time this
objectionable practice will be completely done away with, and the
traffic in eunuchs being forbidden, no one shall venture on this
unpleasant and unprofitable proceeding. I presented the
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n with a bay horse out of those
sent me by S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s; it was the head of the
stable of my private horses. He was so rejoiced over it that it would
be difficult to describe. In truth a horse of this great size and
beauty has hardly come to Hindustan. I also gave him the elephant
Fut&#363;h&#803;, that is unrivalled in fighting, with twenty other
elephants. As Kis&#863;han Singh, who was accompanying Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n, performed laudable service, and was wounded in the leg
by a spear in the fight with the R&#257;n&#257;&rsquo;s men, so that
about twenty noblemen of his were killed and about 3,000 made captive,
he was promoted to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. On the
14th of the same month I gave an order for M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; to betake himself to Qandahar. A strange
occurrence was that as soon as the aforesaid M&#299;rz&#257; started
from Bakhar for that province the news of the death of Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of that place, came. Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n was one of the permanent and intimate attendants of my
uncle Muhammad H&#803;ak&#299;m, and was known as Tuk&#863;hta<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4073src" href="#xd24e4073" name=
"xd24e4073src">23</a> Beg. I gave half his rank (the pay of it) to his
sons. On Monday, the 17th, I went on <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb152" href="#v1pb152" name="v1pb152">152</a>]</span>foot on my
pilgrimage to the enlightened mausoleum of the late king. If it had
been possible, I would have traversed this road with my eyelashes and
head. My revered father, on account of my birth, had gone on foot on a
pilgrimage to the shrine of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n Sanjari Chis&#863;ht&#299;, from
Fath&#803;p&#363;r to Ajmir, a distance of 120 kos: if I should
traverse this road with my head and eyes, what should I have done? When
I was dignified with the good fortune of making this pilgrimage, I saw
the building that had been erected in the cemetery. It did not come up
to my idea of what it ought to be, for that would be approved which the
wayfarers of the world should point to as one the like of which was not
in the inhabited world. Inasmuch as at the time of erecting the
aforesaid building the affair of the ill-starred K&#863;husrau took
place, I started for Lahore, and the architects had built it after a
design of their own. At last a certain expenditure was made until a
large sum was expended, and work went on for three or four years. I
ordered that experienced architects should again lay the foundations,
in agreement with men of experience, in several places, on a settled
plan. By degrees a lofty building was erected, and a very bright garden
was arranged round the building of the shrine, and a large and lofty
gateway with minarets of white stone was built. On the whole they told
me the cost of this lofty edifice was 1,500,000 rupees, equivalent to
50,000 current tumans of Persia and 4,500,000 khanis, according to the
currency of T&#363;r&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 23rd, I went with a band of courtiers who
had not seen it to look at the reservoir in the house of
H&#803;ak&#299;m &#703;Al&#299; like one that had been made at Lahore
in the time of my father. The reservoir is 6 gaz by 6 gaz. At its side
has been erected a well-lighted room, the entrance to which is through
the water, but the water does not get into it. Ten or twelve people
could meet in it. He made an offering of some <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb153" href="#v1pb153" name=
"v1pb153">153</a>]</span>of the cash and jewels that had
accumulated<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4082src" href="#xd24e4082" name=
"xd24e4082src">24</a> in his time. After looking at the room, and the
entering of a number of courtiers therein, I raised him to the rank of
2,000, and returned to the palace. On Sunday, the 14th
S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n, the K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n was
honoured with a jewelled sword for the waist, a robe of honour, and a
special elephant, and was given leave to go to his duty in the Deccan.
R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh, who was attached to him in that service,
was raised to the rank of 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse. As it was
again represented to me that oppression was being committed by the
brethren and attendants of Murtaz&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n on the ryots
and people of Ahmadabad in Gujarat, and that he was unable properly to
restrain his relations and people about him, I transferred the Subah
from him and gave it to A&#703;z&#804;am K&#863;h&#257;n, and it was
settled that the latter should attend at court, and that his eldest son
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n should go to Gujarat as
his deputy. The rank of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n
was fixed at 3,000 personal and 2,500 horse. An order was given that in
company with Mohan D&#257;s d&#299;w&#257;n and Mas&#703;&#363;d Beg
Hamaz&#817;&#257;n&#299; bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; he should carry on
the business of the province. Mohan D&#257;s was promoted to the rank
of 800 with 500 horse, and Mas&#703;&#363;d Beg to 300 with 150 horse.
Tarbiyat K&#863;h&#257;n, one of the personal servants, was given the
rank of 700 with 400 horse, and Na&#7779;ru-llah the same. Mihtar
K&#863;h&#257;n, whose circumstances have been related, died at this
time, and I promoted his son M&#363;nis K&#863;h&#257;n to the rank of
500 personal and 130 horse. On Wednesday, the 4th
Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja, K&#863;husrau had a son born to him by the
daughter of the K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, and I gave him the
name of Buland-ak&#863;htar. On the 6th of the same month Muqarrab
K&#863;h&#257;n sent a picture (with a report) that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb154" href="#v1pb154" name=
"v1pb154">154</a>]</span>belief of the Franks was this, that the
picture was that of T&#299;m&#363;r. At the time when Yildir&#299;m
B&#257;yaz&#299;d was taken prisoner by his victorious army, a
Nazarene, who at that time was ruler<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4087src" href="#xd24e4087" name="xd24e4087src">25</a> of
Constantinople, had sent an ambassador with gifts and presents in token
of submission and service, and an artist who had been sent with the
ambassador took his likeness and brought it away. If this story were
true, no better gift could be presented to me. But as the picture had
no resemblance to any of his descendants I was not satisfied of the
truth of the statement.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Fourth New Year&rsquo;s Feast after the Auspicious
Accession.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The passing of the great star that illumines the
world into the constellation of Aries took place on the night of
Saturday, the 14th Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja, in Hijra 1017 (21st
March, 1609), and New Year&rsquo;s Day that made brilliant the world
began with good auspices and rejoicing. On Friday, the 5th
Muh&#803;arram, in the year 1018, H&#803;ak&#299;m &#703;Al&#299; died.
He was an unrivalled physician; he had derived much profit from Arabic
sciences. He had written a commentary on the Canon (of Avicenna) in the
time of my revered father. He had greater diligence than understanding,
just as his appearance was better than his disposition, and his
acquirements better than his talents; on the whole he was bad-hearted,
and of an evil spirit. On the 20th &#7778;afar I dignified
M&#299;rz&#257; Bark&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;r with the title of
K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam. They brought from the neighbourhood of
Fath&#803;p&#363;r a water-melon, greater than any I had ever seen. I
ordered them to weigh it, and it came to 33 seers. On Monday, the 19th
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal, the feast of my annual lunar weighing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb155" href="#v1pb155" name=
"v1pb155">155</a>]</span>was arranged in the palace of my revered
mother; a part of the money was divided among the women who had
assembled there on that day.</p>
<p class="par">As it had been evident that in order to carry on the
affairs of the State in the Subah of the Deccan it was necessary to
send one of the princes there, it came into my mind to send my son
Parw&#299;z there. I ordered them to send his equipments and fix the
hour for his departure. I summoned to Court Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been nominated to the command of the army
against the rebel R&#257;n&#257; to arrange certain matters at
headquarters, and appointed in his place &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n, whom I exalted with the title of F&#299;r&#363;z-jang.
I sent &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; to carry an
order to all the mansabdars of that army not to depart from the orders
of the aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n, and to pay every heed to his thanks
and blame. On the 4th Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal one of the goatherds,
who are a particular tribe, brought before me a gelded goat that had
teats like a female, and gave every day sufficient milk to take with a
cup of coffee.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4099src" href="#xd24e4099"
name="xd24e4099src">1</a> As milk is one of the favours of Allah, and
the source which nourishes many animals, I looked on this strange
affair as an omen for good. On the 6th of the same month, having given
him the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, I sent K&#863;hurram,
son of K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, to the government of the
province of Sorath, which is known as J&#363;naga&#7693;h (in
Kathiyaw&#257;d). I honoured<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4102src" href=
"#xd24e4102" name="xd24e4102src">2</a> H&#803;ak&#299;m
&#7778;adr&#257; with the title of Masihu-z-zam&#257;n, and gave him
the rank of 500 personal and 30 horse. On the 16th a jewelled
waist-sword was sent to R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh. On the 22nd, having
handed over 2,000,000 rupees for the expenses of the army of the
Deccan, which had been ordered for Parw&#299;z, to a separate
treasurer, 500,000 rupees more were given for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb156" href="#v1pb156" name=
"v1pb156">156</a>]</span>the private expenses of Parw&#299;z. On the
25th, Wednesday, Jah&#257;nd&#257;r (his son), who previously to this
had been appointed, together with Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n
K&#863;h&#257;n Koka, to Bengal, came and waited on me. In reality it
became known to me that he was a born devotee.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4107src" href="#xd24e4107" name="xd24e4107src">3</a> As my mind
was taken up with the preparations for the Deccan, on the 1st
Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-&#257;k&#863;hir I nominated the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; as well to that duty. He was honoured with the
favour of a robe of honour and a horse. Having promoted Karam Chand,
son of Jagann&#257;th, to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, I
sent him in company with Parw&#299;z. On the 4th of the month 370 ahadi
horse were appointed with &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n to the
assistance of the army employed against the R&#257;n&#257;. One hundred
horses were also despatched from the government stables to be given as
he thought proper to the mansabdars and ahadis. On the 17th I gave a
ruby of the value of 60,000 rupees to Parw&#299;z, and another ruby
with two single pearls, worth about 40,000 rupees, to K&#863;hurram. On
Monday, the 28th, Jagann&#257;th was promoted to the rank of 5,000
personal and 3,000 horse, and on the 8th of Rajab, R&#257;y J&#257;y
Singh was promoted to that of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse, and was
dismissed for service in the Deccan. On Thursday, the 9th, Prince
S&#863;hahriy&#257;r from Gujarat came and waited on me. On Tuesday,
the 4th, I despatched my son Parw&#299;z on the service of conquering
the country of the Deccan. He was presented with a robe of honour, a
special horse, a special elephant, a sword, and a jewelled dagger. The
Sardars and Amirs who were appointed with him each according to his
condition received and were made happy with the favour of a horse, a
robe of honour, an elephant, a sword, and a jewelled dagger. I
appointed 1,000 ahadis to be in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb157"
href="#v1pb157" name="v1pb157">157</a>]</span>attendance on Parw&#299;z
for the service of the Deccan. On the same day a representation came
from &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n that having pursued the rebel
R&#257;n&#257; into the hill country into rough places, he had captured
several of his elephants and horses. When night came on he had escaped
with difficulty with his life. As he had made things go hard with him,
he would soon be taken prisoner or killed. I promoted the said
K&#863;h&#257;n to the rank of 5,000 personal, and a rosary of pearls,
worth 10,000 rupees, was given to Parw&#299;z. As I had given the
province of K&#863;handesh and Berar to the said son, I also conferred
on him the fort of &#256;s&#299;r, and 300 horse were sent with him to
be given to ahadis, mansabdars, and whomever else he might consider
worthy of favour. On the 26th, Saif K&#863;h&#257;n B&#257;rha was
given the rank of 2,500 personal and 1,350 horse, and appointed to the
faujd&#257;rship of the Sarkar of Hisar. On Monday, the 4th
Sha&#703;b&#257;n, an elephant was given to Waz&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n.
On Friday, the 22nd, I gave an order that as <i>bang</i> and
<i>b&#363;za</i> (rice spirit) were injurious, they should not be sold
in the bazars and that gambling should be abolished, and on this
subject I issued stringent orders. On the 25th they brought a tiger
from my private menagerie to fight with a bull. Many people gathered
together to see the show, and a band of Jogis (religious mendicants)
with them. One of the Jogis was naked, and the tiger, by way of sport,
and not with the idea of rage, turned towards him. It threw him on the
ground and began to behave to him as it would to its own female. The
next day and on several occasions the same thing took place. As no such
thing had ever been seen before and was exceedingly strange, this has
been recorded.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4121src" href="#xd24e4121"
name="xd24e4121src">4</a> On the 2nd of the month of

horse. Far&#299;d&#363;n K&#863;h&#257;n Barl&#257;s was promoted to
the rank of 2,500 with 2,000 horse. One thousand <i>tolcha</i> of gold
and silver and 1,000 rupees were given in alms on the day of the
procession of the sun into the constellation of the Scorpion, which,
according to the general acceptation of the Hindoos, is called the
Sankr&#257;nt. On the 10th of that month an elephant was presented to
S&#863;h&#257;h Beg Y&#363;z&#299;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4133src"
href="#xd24e4133" name="xd24e4133src">6</a> (? the panther-keeper), and

On account of some suspicion that S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s had
entertained against him, he came to wait upon me. I patronised him, and
gave him the rank of 400 personal and 200 horse. Again, another force,
containing 193 mansabdars and 46 ahadis, I sent after Parw&#299;z for
service in the Deccan. Fifty horses were also entrusted to one of the
servants of the Court to convoy to Parw&#299;z.</p>

Mub&#257;rak K&#863;h&#257;n Sarw&#257;n&#299; was honoured with the

given to him, and 4,000 rupees to H&#803;&#257;j&#299; B&#299;
&#362;zbeg. On the 22nd a ruby and a pearl were given to
S&#863;hahriy&#257;r. One hundred thousand rupees were given for the
subsistence of the &#362;ym&#257;qs (special cavalry) who had been
appointed for service in the Deccan. Two thousand rupees were given to
Farruk&#863;h Beg, the painter, who is unrivalled in the age. Four

the rank of Murtaz&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n to 5,000 personal and horse
they should give him a jagir. I ordered Bih&#257;r&#299; Chand

and equipment from the Zamindars of Agra, and, fixing their monthly

passed. In order to avert the bad omen of this I had myself weighed
against gold, silver, cloth, and grain, and gave away in alms all kinds
of animals, such as elephants, horses, etc., the cost of all of which
was 15,000 rupees. I ordered them to be distributed among the deserving
and the poor. On the 25th, at the request of her father, I took the
daughter of R&#257;m Chand Band&#299;lab into my service (i.e. married
her). I gave an elephant to M&#299;r F&#257;z&#803;il, nephew of
M&#299;r S&#863;har&#299;f, who had been appointed to the
faujd&#257;rship of Qab&#363;lah and those regions
&#703;In&#257;yat-ullah was dignified with the title of
&#703;In&#257;yat K&#863;h&#257;n. On Wednesday, the 1st
Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da, Bih&#257;r&#299; Chand was granted the rank
of 500 personal and 300 horse. A <i>khapwa</i> (dagger), adorned with
jewels was given to my son B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram. Mull&#257;
Hayat&#299;, by whom I had sent a message to the
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, with a verbal message containing
(expressions of) all kinds of condescension and affection, came and
brought before me a ruby and two pearls of the value of about 20,000
rupees, which the K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n had sent by
him. M&#299;r Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain, who was in Burhanpur
and whom <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb161" href="#v1pb161" name=
"v1pb161">161</a>]</span>I had sent for, came and waited on me. I
presented S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n Dakhan&#299; with
2,000 rupees. On the 6th of the aforesaid month, before Parw&#299;z
arrived at Burhanpur, a petition came from the Khankhanan and the Amirs
that the Dakhanis had assembled together and were making disturbances.
When I discovered that, notwithstanding the nomination of Parw&#299;z
and the army that had proceeded with him and been appointed to his
service, they were still in need of support and assistance, it occurred
to me that I should go myself, and by Allah&rsquo;s favour satisfy
myself with regard to that affair. In the meanwhile a petition came
also from &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n that my coming there would be
for the advantage of the daily-increasing State. A petition from
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, from Bijapur, also came, that if one
of the trusted ones of the Court could be appointed there to whom he
could tell his desires and claims, so that the envoy might convey them
to me, he hoped that it might become the means of affording profit to
these slaves (i.e. himself). On this account I consulted with the Amirs
and loyal men, and told them to represent whatever entered into
anyone&rsquo;s mind. My son K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n represented that
inasmuch as so many Amirs had been despatched for the conquest of the
Deccan, it was not necessary for me to go in person. If he were
ordered, he himself would go and attend on the prince and would, please
God, perform this duty while serving him. Those words were approved of
by all those who were loyal. I had never contemplated separation from
him, but as the affair was an important one I necessarily gave him
permission, and ordered that as soon as matters had been arranged he
should return without delay, and should not remain more than a year in
those regions. On Tuesday, the 17th Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da, he was
free to go. I presented him with a special gold-embroidered robe of
honour, a special horse with a jewelled saddle, a jewelled sword, and a
special elephant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb162" href="#v1pb162"
name="v1pb162">162</a>]</span>I also gave him a yak-tail standard
(<i>t&#363;m&#257;n &#7789;&#363;g&#863;h</i>). I appointed Fid&#257;;
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of my faithful servants, and to whom I
gave a robe of honour and a horse and his expenses, promoting him to
the rank of 1,000 personal and 400 horse, original and extra, to go
with K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, in order that if it were necessary to
send anyone to &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n according to his
request, he might despatch him. Lank&#363; Pandit, who in the time of
the late king Akbar had come with offerings from &#703;&#256;dil
K&#863;h&#257;n, I also gave leave to go with K&#863;h&#257;n
Jah&#257;n, bestowing on him a horse, a robe of honour, and money. Of
the Amirs and soldiers who had been appointed with &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n to the duty of beating back the R&#257;n&#257;, men
such as R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo, S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n, R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, and others, with 4,000
or 5,000 horse, were nominated to support K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n. I
sent Mu&#703;tamad K&#863;h&#257;n with the announcement that I had
made him a <i>saz&#257;wal</i> (i.e. one who urges on others), and that
he was to act along with K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n in Ujjain. Out of
the men of the palace, I sent 6,000 or 7,000 horse with him, such as
Saif K&#863;h&#257;n B&#257;rha, H&#803;&#257;j&#299; B&#299;
&#362;zbeg, Salamu-llah &#703;Arab, brother&rsquo;s son of Mub&#257;rak
&#703;Arab, who had in his possession the province of
J&#363;tra(?)<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4196src" href="#xd24e4196"
name="xd24e4196src">9</a> and Darf&#363;l(?) and that neighbourhood,
and other mansabdars and courtiers. At the time of giving them leave I
gave each one an increase of rank and robe of honour and money for
their expenses. Making Muh&#803;ammad Beg paymaster of the army, I
provided him with 1,000,000 rupees to take with him. I sent to
Parw&#299;z a special horse, and to the Khankhanan and other Amirs and
officers who were appointed to that Subah dresses of honour.</p>
<p class="par">After carrying out these matters I left the city for the
purpose of hunting. One thousand rupees were given to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb163" href="#v1pb163" name=
"v1pb163">163</a>]</span>M&#299;r &#703;Al&#299; Akbar. As the
Rab&#299;&#703; Fa&#7779;l (Spring season) had arrived, for fear any
damage should happen to the cultivation of the ryots from the passage
of the army, and notwithstanding that I had appointed a
<i>q&#363;r&#299;s&#257;wul</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e4205src"
href="#xd24e4205" name="xd24e4205src">10</a> (Erskine has Kor, the
Yasawal) (probably a kind of provost marshal) with the band of ahadis
for the purpose of guarding the fields, I ordered certain men to see
what damage had been done to the crops from stage to stage and pay
compensation to the ryots. I gave 10,000 rupees to the daughter of the
Khankhanan, the wife of D&#257;niy&#257;l, 1,000 rupees to
&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m K&#863;har (i.e. ass) for expenses, and
1,000 to Q&#257;ch&#257; the Dakhani. On the 12th, K&#863;h&#257;njar
K&#863;h&#257;n, brother of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, received
the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse original and extra, and
Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n, another brother, that of 600 personal and
300 horse. On this day two antelopes with horns and one doe were taken.
On the 13th I bestowed on and sent to K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n a
special horse. Having promoted Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, son of
M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, to the rank of 1,000 and 500
horse, I gave him 5,000 rupees for expenses, and he was sent off with
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n for service in the Deccan. On this day two
male and three female antelope were killed. On Wednesday, the 10th, I
killed a female <i>n&#299;lg&#257;w</i> and a black antelope with a
gun, and on the 15th a female nilgaw and a <i>chik&#257;ra</i>
(gazelle). On the 17th of the month two rubies and a pearl were brought
to me by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n from Gujarat, as
well as a jewelled opium box, which Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n had sent
from the port of Cambay. On the 20th I killed with a gun a tigress and
a nilgaw. There were two cubs with the tigress, but they disappeared
from view in consequence of the thickness of the jungle and the number
of trees. An order was given that they should search for and bring
them. When I reached the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb164" href=
"#v1pb164" name="v1pb164">164</a>]</span>halting-place my son
K&#863;hurram brought me one of the cubs, and the next day Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n caught the other and brought it. On the 22nd, when I
had got within shot of a nilgaw, suddenly a groom
(<i>jilaud&#257;r</i>) and two <i>kah&#257;r</i> (bearers) appeared,
and the nilgaw escaped. In a great rage I ordered them to kill the
groom on the spot, and to hamstring<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4232src"
href="#xd24e4232" name="xd24e4232src">11</a> the kahars and mount them
on asses and parade them through the camp, so that no one should again
have the boldness to do such a thing. After this I mounted a horse and
continued hunting with hawks and falcons, and came to the
halting-place.</p>
<p class="par">Next day, under the guidance of Iskandar
Mu&#703;&#299;n, I shot a large nilgaw, and promoted him to the rank of
600 personal and 500 horse. On Friday, the 24th, &#7778;afdar
K&#863;h&#257;n, who had come from the Subah of Behar, had the good
fortune to perform his obeisance to me. He presented as offerings a
hundred muhrs, a sword, and five female and one male elephant. The male
elephant was accepted. On the same day Y&#257;dg&#257;r
K&#863;hw&#257;ja of Samarkand came from Balkh and paid his respects.
He made offerings of an album, some horses, and other presents, and was
dignified with a robe of honour. On Wednesday, 6th
Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja, Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk, who had been removed
from the paymastership of the army against the rebel R&#257;n&#257;,
ill and miserable, waited on me. On the 14th of the said month, having
pardoned all the faults of &#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m
K&#863;har,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4243src" href="#xd24e4243" name=
"xd24e4243src">12</a> I promoted him to the rank of

and had the good fortune to pay his respects to me.</p>

Sal&#257;mu-llah is mentioned later on (p. 78), and is described as
brother&rsquo;s son of Mub&#257;rak, who held the country of Jotra (?)
and Darful. He is also mentioned in the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, p. 38,
where Mub&#257;rak is described as ruler (<i>h&#803;&#257;kim</i>) of
J&#363;yza and Saf&#363;l (?). But a MS. of the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma in
my possession only mentions J&#363;yza or J&#363;yna. I think
J&#363;yza must be Juina or Juanny, which, according to Sir William
Jones, is one of the names of the island of Johanna or Hinzuan (one of
the Comorro Islands), and that Saf&#363;l must be Sofala, a town on the
east coast of Africa. Sir W. Jones was landed on Johanna, and has a
long account of the island (see his works). The Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma
says that Sal&#257;mu-llah killed himself with drink. There is a short
notice of him in the Ma&#702;&#257;s&#804;ir, ii, 641, where he is
called by his title of S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at

Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s conduct was sufficiently brutal, but the

<h2 class="main">The Fifth New Year&rsquo;s Feast from the Auspicious
Accession.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On Sunday, the 24th Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja
(20th March, 1610), after two watches and three gharis the sun entered
into the constellation of Aries, which is the house of honour and good
fortune, and at this auspicious hour the New Year&rsquo;s feast was
arranged at B&#257;k Bhal, one of the villages of the parganah of
B&#257;r&#299;, and according to the rules of my revered father I
mounted the throne. On that morning, which was the New Year&rsquo;s Day
that lighted up the world, and coincided with the 1st of Farward&#299;n
of the 5th year from my accession, I held a public reception, and all
the nobles and servants of the Court had the good fortune to pay their
respects. Some of the nobles&rsquo; offerings were laid before me.
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am gave a pearl worth 4,000 rupees;
Mir&#257;n &#7778;adr Jah&#257;n, twenty-eight hawks and falcons, and
other gifts; Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n, two European boxes, the
sides of which were made with slabs of glass, so that whatever was
placed inside could be seen from outside in a way that you might say
there was nothing between them; Kis&#863;hwar K&#863;h&#257;n,
twenty-two male and female elephants. In the same way each of the
servants of the Court laid before me the presents and offerings that
they had. Na&#7779;ru-llah, son of Fath&#803;u-llah
s&#863;harbatch&#299; (in charge of the <i>s&#863;harbat</i>), was
placed in charge of the offerings. By S&#257;rang Deo, who had been
appointed to carry orders to the victorious army of the Deccan, I sent
souvenirs (<i>tabarruk</i>) to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb166"
href="#v1pb166" name="v1pb166">166</a>]</span>Parw&#299;z and to each
of the officers. I presented H&#803;us&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n, son of
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4264src" href="#xd24e4264" name="xd24e4264src">1</a>
Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;, who had taken to the ways of a dervish and
seclusion, with 1,000 rupees and a <i>farj&#299;</i> shawl. The day
after the New Year&rsquo;s Day I mounted and started for a tiger-hunt.
Two males and a female were killed. I gave rewards to the ahadis who
had shown bravery and gone in to the tigers, and increased their
monthly pay. On the 26th of the same month I went and busied myself
mostly with hunting nilgaw. As the air was hot and the (propitious)
hour for re-entering Agra had nearly arrived, I went to
R&#363;pb&#257;s, and hunted antelope in that neighbourhood for some
days. On Saturday, the 1st Muh&#803;arram, 1019, R&#363;p
K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779;, who was the founder of
R&#363;pb&#257;s, presented the offering that he had prepared. That
which pleased was accepted and what remained was given him back as a
reward. At the same time B&#257;yaz&#299;d Mankal&#299; and his
brothers, who had come from the Subah of Bengal, were honoured with
paying their respects. Sayyid &#256;dam, son of Sayyid Q&#257;sim
B&#257;rha, who had come from Ahmadabad, also had the same good
fortune. He presented an elephant as an offering. The faujd&#257;rship
of the Subah of Multan was given to Wal&#299; B&#299; &#362;zbeg in
place of T&#257;j K&#863;h&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 3rd Muh&#803;arram of the 5th year, I
halted at the Mand&#257;kar Garden, which is in the neighbourhood of
the city. On the morning on which was the auspicious hour of entry into
the city, after a watch and two gharis had passed I mounted and rode on
a horse to the beginning of the inhabited part, and when I came to the
immediate neighbourhood mounted on an elephant, so that the people from
far and near might see, and scattering money on both sides of the road,
at the hour <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb167" href="#v1pb167"
name="v1pb167">167</a>]</span>that the astrologers had chosen, after
midday had passed, entered with congratulation and happiness the royal
palace. In accordance with the usual custom of the New Year I had
ordered them to decorate the palace, which is like the courts of
heaven. After seeing the decorations, K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n laid
before me the offering that he had prepared. Having accepted out of the
ornaments and jewels, dresses and goods, whatever I approved of, I gave
the rest as a reward to him. I had ordered the clerks of the hunting
department to write out (a list of) all the animals that had been
killed from the time of my leaving until I re-entered the city. At this
time they represented that in 56 days 1,362 animals, quadrupeds, and
birds had been killed; the tigers were 7 in number; nilgaw, male and

of Cambay and Surat, and had the honour of waiting on me. He had
brought jewels and jewelled things, and vessels of gold and silver made
in Europe, and other beautiful and uncommon presents, male and female
Abyssinian slaves, Arab horses, and things of all kinds that came into
his mind. Thus his presents were laid before me for two and a half
months, and most of them were pleasing to me. On this day &#7778;afdar
K&#863;h&#257;n, who held the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, had
an increase of 500 personal and 200 horse, and was presented with a
standard, and given leave to return to his former jagir. Standards were
also given to Kis&#863;hwar K&#863;h&#257;n and

elephant for Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n (Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l&rsquo;s
son) was handed over to his son Bis&#863;h&#363;tan, to take to his
father. I bestowed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb168" href=
"#v1pb168" name="v1pb168">168</a>]</span>1,000 rupees on
K&#863;hw&#257;ja H&#803;usain, a descendant of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n Chis&#863;ht&#299;, as was usual for the
half-year. The Khankhanan had sent as an offering a &ldquo;Y&#363;suf

beautiful gilt binding, worth 1,000 muhrs. This Ma&#703;&#7779;&#363;m,
his Wakil, brought and submitted. Up to the day of culmination, which
is the conclusion of the New Year&rsquo;s feast, every day many
offerings were laid before me by the Amirs and servants of the Court.
Whichever of the rarities was approved of by me I accepted, and gave
back what was left. On Thursday, the 13th, corresponding to the 19th
Farward&#299;n, which is the day of culmination of the sun and of
gladness and pleasure, I ordered them to prepare an entertainment of
different kinds of intoxicating drinks, and an order was given to the
Amirs and servants of the Court that everyone might choose the kind of
drink he affected. Many took wine and some <i>mufarrih&#803;</i>
(exhilarating drinks), whilst some ate what they wished of the
preparations of opium. The assembly was successfully held.
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n from Gujarat had sent as
an offering a throne of silver, inlaid and painted, of a new fashion
and shape, which was presented to me. A standard was also conferred on
Mah&#257; Singh. In the commencement of my reign I had repeatedly given
orders that no one should make eunuchs or buy or sell them, and whoever
did so would be answerable as a criminal. At this time Afz&#803;al
K&#863;h&#257;n sent some of these evildoers to Court from the Subah of
Behar, who were continually perpetrating this vile offence. I ordered
these unthinking ones (<i>b&#299;-&#703;&#257;qibat&#257;n</i>) to be
imprisoned for life. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb169" href=

<p class="par">On the night of the 12th an uncommon and strange event
took place. Some Delhi singers (<i>Qaww&#257;l&#257;n</i>, see Jarrett,

S&#863;h&#257;h was, by way of buffoonery, mimicking a religious dance.
This verse of Am&#299;r K&#863;husrau was the refrain
(<i>miy&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;na</i>) of the song&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Each nation has its right road of faith and its

engraver, who in his own craft was one of the first of the age, and had
the title of K&#863;hal&#299;fa, and was an old servant, and with whose
father I had learned when I was little, came forward and said, &ldquo;I
have heard from my father that one day S&#863;haik&#863;h
Niz&#804;&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n Auliy&#257; had put his cap on the side of
his head, and was sitting on a terraced roof by the bank of the Jumna

Am&#299;r K&#863;husrau appeared, and the S&#863;haik&#863;h turned to
him and said, &lsquo;Do you see this crowd,&rsquo; and then he recited
this line:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par first">The aforesaid Mull&#257;, when these words were
uttered, and the last words of the second hemistich passed over his
tongue, became senseless and fell down. Conceiving <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb170" href="#v1pb170" name=
"v1pb170">170</a>]</span>a great fear from his falling down, I went to
his head. Most of those who were present doubted whether he had not had
an epileptic fit. The physicians who were present distractedly made
inquiry and felt his pulse and brought medicine. However much they beat
their hands and feet and exerted themselves, he did not come to.
Immediately he fell he had delivered his soul to the Creator. As his
body was quite warm, they thought that possibly some life might be left
in him. After a short time it became evident that the thing was all
over and he was dead. They carried him away dead to his own house. I
had never seen this kind of death, and sent money to his sons for his
shroud and burial, and the next morning they sent him to Delhi and
buried him in the burial-place of his ancestors.</p>
<p class="par">On Friday, the 21st, Kis&#863;hwar K&#863;h&#257;n, who
held the rank of 1,500, was promoted to 2,000 personal and horse, and,
having been presented with an Iraq horse out of my private stable, a
robe of honour and a private elephant, named

honoured with a robe and a horse, was sent off together with his
brothers in the company of Kis&#863;hwar K&#863;h&#257;n. An elephant
from my private stud, by name &#703;&#256;lam-gum&#257;n, was entrusted
to Hab&#299;bu-llah for R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh and sent. A special
horse was sent to Bengal for Kes&#863;ho D&#257;s
M&#257;r&#363;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4358src" href="#xd24e4358"

&#703;Arab K&#863;h&#257;n, the jagirdar of Jalalabad. At this time
Iftik&#863;har K&#863;h&#257;n had sent an offering of a rare elephant
from Bengal. As I approved of it, it was entered among my private
elephants. I raised the rank of Ah&#803;mad<a class="noteref" id=

command of the army of Bangash on account of his good service and that
of his sons, from his original rank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse
by 500 more personal. I sent a gold throne<a class="noteref" id=

work for Parw&#299;z, and a <i>sarp&#299;ch</i>, which was of rubies
and pearls, and made at a cost of 2,000 rupees, was sent for
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n by the hand of H&#803;ab&#299;b, son of
Sarbar&#257;h K&#863;h&#257;n, to Burhanpur. At this time it became
known that Kaukab, son of Qamar K&#863;h&#257;n, had become intimate
with a Sanyasi, and by degrees his words, which were all blasphemous
and impious, made an impression on that foolish fellow. He had made
&#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f, son of Naq&#299;b K&#863;h&#257;n, and
S&#863;har&#299;f, his cousins, partners in that error. When this
affair was discovered, with only a slight frightening they revealed
certain circumstances with regard to themselves, the relation of which
would be extremely disgusting. Considering their punishment advisable,
I imprisoned Kaukab<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4375src" href=
"#xd24e4375" name="xd24e4375src">13</a> and S&#863;har&#299;f after
giving them a whipping, and ordered &#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f a
hundred lashes in my presence. This special chastisement (was given)
for the purpose of carrying out the Divine law in order that other
ignorant persons might not be disposed towards the same actions. On
Monday, the 24th, Mu&#703;az&#804;z&#804;am K&#863;h&#257;n was
despatched to Delhi to punish the rebels and disaffected of that
neighbourhood. Two thousand rupees were given to
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n Dakhan&#299;. I had ordered
S&#863;haik&#863;h H&#803;usain Dars&#863;han&#299; to proceed with
certain firmans to Bengal and presents to each of the Amirs of that
Subah. I now gave him his orders and despatched him. With an eye on his
actions and his approved services, I promoted Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n to the rank of 5,000 personal and horse, and bestowed
on him a special dress of honour. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb172" href="#v1pb172" name="v1pb172">172</a>]</span>I gave a
special dress of honour also to Kis&#863;hwar K&#863;h&#257;n, and
presented R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n with an Iraq horse, and similarly to
the other Amirs there were given robes of honour or horses.
Far&#299;d&#363;n Barl&#257;s, who held the rank of 1,500 personal and
1,300 horse, I promoted to 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse.</p>
<p class="par">On the night of Monday, the 1st &#7778;afar, through the
carelessness of the servants, a great fire occurred in the house of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan, and before they became aware
of it and the fire could be put out many of his properties were burnt.
In order to afford consolation to the mind of the K&#863;hw&#257;ja and
to make up for the loss he had sustained, I gave him 40,000 rupees. On
Saif K&#863;h&#257;n B&#257;rha, who had been cherished and brought up
by me, I bestowed a standard. I increased the rank of
Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk, who had been appointed to the Diwanship of Kabul,
from his original of 1,000 personal and 225 horse by 200 personal and
275 horse, and dismissed him. The next day I sent a
<i>ph&#363;l-ka&#7789;&#257;ra</i> (dagger) studded with valuable
jewels to Burhanpur to K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">A widow woman complained that Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n
had taken her daughter by force in the port of Cambay, and after some
while, during which he had kept her in his own house, when she enquired
for the girl had said that she had died by an unavoidable death. I
ordered an enquiry to be made into the affair. After much search I
discovered that one of his attendants had been guilty of this outrage,
and had him put to death, and reduced Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s
mansab by one half, and made an allowance to the woman who had been
thus injured.</p>
<p class="par">As on Sunday, the 7th of the month, a
<i>qir&#257;n-i-nah&#803;s&#299;n</i> (an unlucky conjunction) had
occurred, I gave alms of gold and silver and other metals, and
different kinds of cereals, to faqirs and indigent people to be divided
in most parts of the dominion. On the night of Monday, the 8th, having
sent for S&#863;haik&#863;h H&#803;usain Sirhind&#299; and <span class=

who were celebrated for the adoption of the ways of dervishdom and the
state of poverty, a party was held, and by degrees the assembly engaged
warmly in <i>sam&#257;&#703;</i> and <i>wajd</i> (dervish dancing and
ecstasy). Hilarity and frenzy were not wanting. After the meeting was
over I gave money to each and gave him leave. As M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; Beg Tark&#863;h&#257;n repeatedly made
representations with regard to provisions for Qandahar and the monthly
pay of the musketeers of the said fort, I ordered 200,000 rupees to be
sent there from the treasury of Lahore.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">On the 19th Urdibihis&#863;ht, in the fifth year of my
reign, corresponding with the 4th &#7778;afar, there occurred a strange
affair at Patna, which is the seat of government of the province of
Behar. Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of the Subah, went off
to the jagir to which he had just been appointed, and which was at a
distance of 60 kos from Patna, and handed over the fort and the city to
the charge of S&#863;haik&#863;h Ban&#257;ras&#299; and
G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804; Zain-k&#863;h&#257;n&#299;, the Diwan of the
Subah, and to a number of other mansabdars. With the idea that there
were no enemies in that region he did not satisfy himself as he should
have with regard to the protection of the fort and city. By chance, at
that time an unknown man of the name of Qut&#804;b belonging to the
people of Uch, who was a mischievous and seditious fellow, came to the
province of Ujjainiyya,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4406src" href=
"#xd24e4406" name="xd24e4406src">15</a> which is in the neighbourhood
of Patna, with the look of a dervish and the clothes of a beggar, and
having made acquaintance with men of that part, who were always
seditious, represented to them that he was K&#863;husrau, who had
escaped from prison and conveyed himself there; saying that if they
would accompany and assist him, after the affair had been completed
they would be the ministers of his State. In <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb174" href="#v1pb174" name=
"v1pb174">174</a>]</span>short, deceiving those simpletons with foolish
words he brought them over to him and persuaded them that he was
K&#863;husrau. He showed those deceived ones the parts about his eyes,
where at some time he had produced scars, of which the marks were still
apparent, and told them that in the prison they had fastened cups
(<i>ka&#7789;or&#299;</i>) on them and those were the marks.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4414src" href="#xd24e4414" name=
"xd24e4414src">16</a> Through these falsehoods and deceit a number of
foot- and horsemen had collected round him, and had obtained
information that Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n was not at Patna.
Considering this a great opportunity, they made a raid, and when two or
three hours of the day had passed on Sunday came to the city, and being
hindered by nothing went for the fort. S&#863;haik&#863;h
Ban&#257;ras&#299;, who was in the fort, obtaining news of this, went
in a disturbed state to the gate of the fort. The enemy, who came on
with speed, did not give him time to close the gate of the fort.
Together with G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;, he betook himself to the side of
the river by a wicket gate, and procuring a boat proposed to go to
Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n. Those rebels came with ease into the fort
and took possession of Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s property and
the royal treasury; and some of those wretched creatures who wait on
events, who were in the city and its neighbourhood, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb175" href="#v1pb175" name=
"v1pb175">175</a>]</span>joined them. This news reached Afz&#803;al
K&#863;h&#257;n at Gorakhpur (K&#863;harakp&#363;r),<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e4423src" href="#xd24e4423" name="xd24e4423src">17</a> and
S&#863;haik&#863;h Ban&#257;ras&#299; and G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804; also
came to him there by way of the river. Letters came from the city that
this wretch, who called himself K&#863;husrau, was in reality not
K&#863;husrau. Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n, placing his trust on the
grace and mercy of Allah, and through my good fortune, started without
delay against those rebels. In five days he reached the neighbourhood
of Patna. When the news of Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s coming
reached those scoundrels, they entrusted the fort to one of those whom
they had confidence in, and the horse and foot arraying themselves went
out for four kos to meet Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n. A fight took
place on the bank of the river P&#363;n P&#363;n, and after a slight
skirmish the array of those ill-fated ones was broken and they became
scattered. In great bewilderment a second time that wretch was coming
into the fort with a few men. Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n followed him,
and did not allow them to close the gate of the fort. Going to
Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s house in a state of confusion, they
fortified the house and remained there for three watches, and fought.
They wounded about thirty people with arrows. After his companions had
gone to <i>jahannam</i> (hell) he himself became helpless, and asked
for quarter, and waited upon Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n. In order to
put a stop to this affair, Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n executed him on
the same day, and imprisoned some of his companions who had fallen
alive into his hand. These items of news one after another reached the
royal ear. I summoned to Agra S&#863;haik&#863;h Ban&#257;ras&#299; and
G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804; Zain-k&#863;h&#257;n&#299; and the other
mansabdars who had made default in holding the fort and protecting the
city, and ordered their hair and beards <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb176" href="#v1pb176" name="v1pb176">176</a>]</span>to be cut off,
and that they should be clothed in women&rsquo;s clothes, seated on
asses, and paraded round the city of Agra and in the bazars, as a
warning and example to others.</p>
<p class="par">At this time representations succeeded each other from
Parw&#299;z and the Amirs appointed to the Deccan and those who were
well-wishers of the State, that &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n
B&#299;j&#257;p&#363;r&#299; prayed that they would send to him
M&#299;r Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain Inj&#363;, on whose words
and acts all the rulers of the Deccan had great reliance, that he might
associate himself with them and dispel the fear in their minds, and the
affairs of that place might be arranged as it might seem proper to
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, who had chosen the way of loyalty and
service. In any case, he might drive out of their minds the fear that
was in them, and soothing them might give him hopes of the royal
favour. In order to obtain this end, on the 16th of the same month I
despatched the above-mentioned M&#299;r, giving him a present of 10,000
rupees. I increased the former rank of Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n,
which was 1,000 personal and 500 horse, by 500 personal and horse, in
order that he might go to the support of his brother Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n in Bengal. At the same time, in order to punish
Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, Zamindar of the province
B&#257;ndh&#363;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4433src" href="#xd24e4433"
name="xd24e4433src">18</a> who had withdrawn his foot from the circle
of obedience and service, I appointed Mah&#257; Singh, grandson of
R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh, to proceed to put down the disaffection in
that region and at the same time administer the estate of the jagir of
the Raja, which was in that neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="par">On the 20th of the month I gave an elephant to
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n Dakhan&#299;. As the governor
of Jalalabad had written and represented the ruinous state of the fort
of that place, I ordered what might be required for the repair of the
said fort to be taken from the treasury of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb177" href="#v1pb177" name=
"v1pb177">177</a>]</span>Lahore. Iftik&#863;h&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n
had done approved service in Bengal. On the request of the governor of
that Subah I increased his original rank, which was 1,500, by 500. On
the 28th a representation came from &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
F&#299;r&#363;z-jang, containing recommendations in favour of some of
the zealous servants who had been sent with him to subdue the rebel
R&#257;n&#257;. As G&#863;hazn&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n J&#257;lwar&#299;
had shown the greatest zeal of all in this service, I increased by 500
personal and 400 horse his former rank, which was 1,500 personal and
300 horse. In the same manner each one of those persons was promoted
according to his services.</p>
<p class="par">Daulat K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been sent to Allahabad
to bring the throne of black stone, came on Wednesday, the 4th of the
month of Mihr (15th September, 1610), and had an audience and brought
the stone safe and sound. In truth it was a wonderful slab, very black
and shining. Many say it is of a species of touchstone; in length it
was one-eighth less than four cubits, and in breadth 2&frac12; cubits
and one <i>tas&#363;</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4445src" href=
"#xd24e4445" name="xd24e4445src">19</a> whilst its thickness may be
three <i>tas&#363;</i>. I ordered stone-cutters to carve suitable
couplets on the sides of it. They had attached feet to it of the same
kind of stone. I often sat on that throne.</p>
<p class="par">As the brothers of K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam
became security for him, I brought out of prison
&#703;Abdu-s-Subh&#803;&#257;n K&#863;h&#257;n, who was in confinement
for certain offences, and promoted him to the rank of 1,000 personal
and 400 horse, and appointed him to the faujd&#257;rship of the Subah
of Allahabad, and gave him the jagir of Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n, the
brother of Isl&#257;m <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb178" href=
"#v1pb178" name="v1pb178">178</a>]</span>K&#863;h&#257;n. I sent
Tarbiyat K&#863;h&#257;n to the faujd&#257;rship of the Sarkar of
Alwar. On the 12th of the same month a representation arrived from
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n that the Khankhanan, according to my order,
had started for the Court in company with Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n,
and that M&#299;r Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain, who had been
nominated by the Court to go to Bijapur, had also gone from Burhanpur,
together with the wakils of &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, to
Bijapur. On the 21st of the same month I promoted Murtaz&#803;&#257;
K&#863;h&#257;n to the subadarship of the Panjab, which is one of the
largest charges in my dominions, and gave him a special shawl. Having
appointed T&#257;j K&#863;h&#257;n, who was in the Subah of Multan to
the governorship of Kabul, I added 500 horse to the rank of 3,000
personal and 1,500 horse already held by him. At the request of
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n F&#299;r&#363;z-jang, the son of
R&#257;n&#257; Shankar was also promoted in rank. When Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been sent to Burhanpur to ascertain the
numbers of the forces of the Amirs appointed to the Deccan, and to
bring the Khankhanan, arrived in the neighbourhood of Agra, he left the
Khankhanan some stages off the city and came on in front himself, and
was honoured with the good fortune of paying his respects and kissing
the threshold. After a few days, on the 12th &#256;b&#257;n, the
Khankhanan came and waited on me. As many of those who were loyal had
represented the state of his affairs whether true or false, according
to their ideas, and I was displeased with him, because the degree of
favour and regard that I previously had observed in his case and that I
had seen in my revered father had not produced its effect, I did
justice in the matter, for previously to this a letter of appointment
to the service of the Deccan for a certain time had been given to him,
and he had proceeded there in attendance on Sult&#804;&#257;n
Parw&#299;z with other nobles for that important matter. After he
arrived at Burhanpur he had not looked to the opportuneness of the
time, and at an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb179" href="#v1pb179"
name="v1pb179">179</a>]</span>improper season for moving, and when
forage and other necessaries had not been laid in, he had taken
Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z and his forces above the Ghats, and by
degrees, in consequence of want of concert among the Sardars and his
treachery, and of conflicting opinions, things had come to such a pass
that grain was obtained with difficulty, and not a <i>m&#257;n</i> was
to be got for large sums of money. The affairs of the army became so
confused that nothing went on properly, and horses, camels, and other
four-footed beasts died. In consequence of the exigency of the time he
had patched up a kind of peace with the enemy and withdrawn
Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z and the army to Burhanpur. As this
business did not turn out well, all the well-wishers of the State knew
that this division (of counsels) and confusion had arisen from
treachery and want of arrangement of the Khankhanan, and represented
this to the Court. Although this appeared altogether incredible, at
last this impression was left upon my mind, and a representation came
from K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n to the effect that all this mischief
and confusion had arisen through the treachery of the Khankhanan;
either this service should be left entirely in his control, or,
summoning him to Court, I should appoint to this duty this man whom I
had myself cherished and brought up, and appoint 30,000 horse to
support this slave (K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n himself), in order that
in the space of two years, having freed the whole of the royal
province, now in the possession of the enemy, and having brought the
fort of Qandahar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4466src" href="#xd24e4466"
name="xd24e4466src">20</a> and other forts on the border into the
occupation of the servants of the Court, he should include in the royal
dominions the province of Bijapur. If he did not complete this service
in that time, he might be debarred from the good fortune of paying his
respects (to me) and would not show his face to the servants of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb180" href="#v1pb180" name=
"v1pb180">180</a>]</span>the Court. When the relations between the
Sardars and the Khankhanan reached this point, I did not consider it
advisable for him to be there any longer, and handed over the command
to K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n and sent for him to Court. In reality the
cause of my disinclination and want of favour to him was this. The
degree of inclination and disinclination towards him in future will be
in accordance with whatever may become clear.</p>
<p class="par">I favoured and promoted Sayyid &#703;Al&#299;
B&#257;rha, who is one of our distinguished young men, with an increase
of 500 personal and 200 horse beyond his previous rank, which was 1,000
personal and 500 horse, and gave D&#257;r&#257;b K&#863;h&#257;n, son
of the Khankhanan, the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, with the
Sarkar of Ghazipur as his jagir. Previously to this I had had the
daughter of M&#299;rz&#257; Muz&#804;affar H&#803;usain, son of
Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain M&#299;rz&#257; &#7778;afaw&#299;, ruler
of Qandahar, betrothed to my son Sult&#804;&#257;n K&#863;hurram, and
on this date, the 17th &#256;b&#257;n, as the marriage meeting had been
arranged, I went to the house of B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram and
passed the night there. I presented most of the Amirs with robes of
honour. Some of those confined in the fort of Gwalior I released, and
especially H&#803;&#257;j&#299; M&#299;rak. Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n
had collected 100,000 rupees from the <i>k&#863;h&#257;li&#7779;a</i>
(directly managed) parganahs. As he was at the head of the army and the
service, I handed this over to him as a present. Giving a little gold
and silver and some of every kind of jewellery and grain to trustworthy
men, I determined that they should distribute them to the poor of Agra.
On the same day a report came from K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n that
&#298;raj, the son of the Khankhanan, had obtained leave from the
prince, and according to orders he had despatched him to Court. With
regard to what had been ordered in the case of Ab&#363;-l-fath&#803;,
of Bijapur, as the above-mentioned was an experienced man, and his
being sent would cause despair to the other Sardars of the Deccan to
whom promises had been made, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb181"
href="#v1pb181" name="v1pb181">181</a>]</span>had (therefore) kept him
under surveillance.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4478src" href=
"#xd24e4478" name="xd24e4478src">21</a> An order had been sent that as
Kes&#863;ho D&#257;s, the son of R&#257;y Kalah(?), was in the service
of Parw&#299;z, if any impediment should occur in sending him, he
(K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n) should despatch him whether he wished it
or not. Immediately on this becoming known to Parw&#299;z, he gave him
leave and said to K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n: &ldquo;These few words
from my mouth thou wilt represent, that as I would give my existence
and life for the service of my visible God (Jah&#257;ng&#299;r), what
is there in the being or annihilation of Kes&#863;ho D&#257;s<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4481src" href="#xd24e4481" name=
"xd24e4481src">22</a> that I should show any resistance in sending him?
When they (i.e. the king) send for my confidential servants for any
reason it produces a feeling of hopelessness and disquietude of mind in
the rest, and becoming known in these regions gives an idea of
disfavour on the part of our lord and Qibla (place looked towards in
worship). As for the rest, it is His Majesty&rsquo;s order.&rdquo; From
the date on which the fort of Ahmadnagar, by the efforts of my deceased
brother D&#257;niy&#257;l, came into the possession of the heads of the
victorious State, up till now, the guardianship and preservation of
that place had been entrusted to K&#863;hw&#257;ja Beg M&#299;rz&#257;
&#7778;afaw&#299;, who was a relative of the asylum of pardon
S&#863;h&#257;h T&#804;ahm&#257;sp. After the disturbance of the rebel
Deccanis went to a great length, and they besieged the said fort, he
had committed no fault in the duties of devotedness and holding of the
fort. When the Khankhanan and the Amirs and other leaders who had
assembled at Burhanpur in waiting on Parw&#299;z devoted themselves to
the driving back and defeat of the rebels, and from the differences of
opinion and quarrels of the Amirs, and the absence of provision of
forage and grain, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb182" href=
"#v1pb182" name="v1pb182">182</a>]</span>those who looked after matters
of importance brought this large army into improper roads and among
hills and difficult passes, they in a short space of time rendered it
wretched and impotent, and matters had come to such a pass and the
difficulty with regard to grain was such that they were giving a life
for a loaf. They then turned back helplessly with their objects
unfulfilled. The garrison of the fort, who were expecting aid from this
army, on hearing this news, lost heart and stability, and tumultuously
wished to vacate the fort at once. When K&#863;hw&#257;ja Beg
M&#299;rz&#257; became aware of this he endeavoured to soothe and quiet
the men, but though he did his best it had no good result. At last,
under an agreement, he vacated the fort, and proceeded to Burhanpur,
and on the day mentioned waited on the prince. Representations with
regard to his coming reached me, and, as it was clear that he had not
been wanting in bravery and loyalty, I ordered his rank of 5,000
personal and horse to be confirmed and a jagir to be given him. On the
9th a petition came from some of the Amirs in the Deccan that on the
22nd S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n M&#299;r Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n
H&#803;usain had gone to Bijapur. &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n sent
his wakil forward for 20 kos, and himself received him at a distance of
3 kos, and took the M&#299;r by the same road to his own residence.</p>
<p class="par">As the desire to hunt overcame me, at a propitious hour
determined by the astrologers, when a watch and six gharis had passed
on the night of Friday, the 15th Ramaz&#803;&#257;n, corresponding with
the 10th &#256;z&#817;ar in the 5th year (of my reign), I started to
hunt, and made my first halt in the Dahrah Garden, which is near the
city. At this stage I gave M&#299;r &#703;Al&#299; Akbar leave to go
into the city after bestowing on him 2,000 rupees and a special warm
wrapper (<i>fargul</i>). In order that the grain and cultivation should
not be trodden down by my men I ordered that all should remain in the
city but the men who were actually wanted and my personal servants.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb183" href="#v1pb183" name=
"v1pb183">183</a>]</span>Having entrusted the charge of the city to
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n I gave him his leave. On the 14th
Sa&#703;du-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Sa&#703;&#299;d
K&#863;h&#257;n, was given an elephant. On the 28th, corresponding with
the 21st Ramaz&#803;&#257;n, forty-four elephants, which
H&#257;s&#863;him K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n,
had sent as an offering from Orissa, were produced before me. Of these
one was very good and tame; this one I put in my private stud. On the
28th an eclipse (of the sun, <i>kus&#363;f</i>) took place, in order to
do away with the unluckiness of which I weighed myself against gold and
silver; it came to 1,800 tolas of gold and 4,900 rupees. This, along
with several kinds of vegetables and sorts of animals such as elephants
and horses and cattle, I ordered to be divided among deserving people
who were unprovided for and helpless poor of the city of Agra and other
cities in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="par">As the affairs of the army which had been nominated for
the subjugation of the Deccan under the command of Parw&#299;z, and
leadership of the Khankhanan and other high Amirs such as R&#257;ja
M&#257;n Singh, K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n, the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257;, and other mansabdars, and
other leaders of every tribe and condition, had ended in this, that
they had turned back from half-way and returned to Burhanpur, and all
the confidential servants and news-writers who spoke the truth had sent
in reports to the Court, that although there were many causes for the
ruin of this army, yet the chief reason was the disagreement of the
Amirs, especially the treachery of the Khankhanan, it came into my mind
that I must send K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am with another fresh
and powerful army to make amends for and set to rights some of the
improper proceedings that had arisen from the disagreement of the Amirs
that has been described. On the 11th of Day he (K&#863;h&#257;n
A&#703;z&#804;am) was honoured with the charge of this duty, and an
order was given to the Diwans to make preparations and send him off
quickly. I appointed K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, Far&#299;d&#363;n
K&#863;h&#257;n <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb184" href="#v1pb184"
name="v1pb184">184</a>]</span>Barl&#257;s, Y&#363;suf K&#863;h&#257;n,
son of H&#803;usain K&#863;h&#257;n Tukriyah, &#703;Al&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n Niy&#257;z&#299;, B&#257;z Bah&#257;dur Qalm&#257;q,
and other mansabdars, near to the number of 10,000 horse, to accompany
him. It was settled that in addition to the ahadis who were appointed
to this duty 2,000 others should accompany him, making altogether
12,000 horse. Having sent with him thirty lakhs of rupees and several
elephants, I gave him his leave and presented him with a magnificent
dress of honour, a jewelled sword-belt, a horse with a jewelled
saddle<span class="corr" id="xd24e4500" title="Not in source">,</span>
a private elephant, and 500,000 rupees for expenses. An order was given
that the chiefs of the civil department should recover this from his
jagir. The Amirs who were under his orders were honoured with robes of
honour, horses, and presents. I increased by 500 more horse the rank
held by Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n, of 4,000 personal and 3,000
horse, and ordered him to conduct K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am and
this army to Burhanpur, and having enquired into (the circumstances of)
the destruction of the army, should give the order of the appointment
of the K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am to the Amirs of those regions
and make them of one purpose and counsel with him. He was to see the
state of preparation of the army of those parts, and after arranging
all matters should bring the Khankhanan with him to Court. On Sunday,
the 4th S&#863;hawwal, when near the end of the day, I engaged in a
cheetah hunt. I had determined that on this day and Thursdays no
animals should be killed and I would eat no meat, on Sunday especially
because of the respect my revered father had for that day in not being
inclined to eat flesh on it, and in forbidding the killing of any
animals for the reason that on the night of Sunday his own honoured
birth had taken place. He used to say it was better on that day that
all animals should be free from the calamity of those of a butcherly
disposition. Thursday is the day of my accession. On that day also I
ordered that animals should not be killed, so that whilst sporting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb185" href="#v1pb185" name=
"v1pb185">185</a>]</span>I should not shoot an arrow or a gun at wild
animals. In hunting with cheetahs An&#363;p R&#257;y, who is one of my
close attendants, was heading the men who were with him in the hunt at
a little distance<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4505src" href="#xd24e4505"
name="xd24e4505src">23</a> from me and came to a tree on which some
kites were sitting. When his sight fell on those kites he took a bow
and some pointless arrows (<i>tukk&#257;</i>) and went towards them. By
chance in the neighbourhood of that tree he saw a half-eaten bullock.
Near it a huge, powerful tiger got up out of a clump that was near and
went off. Though not more than two gharis of day remained, as he knew
my liking for tiger-hunting, he and some of those who were with him
surrounded the tiger and sent some one to me to give me the news. When
it reached me I rode there at once in a state of excitement and at full
speed, and B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram, R&#257;m D&#257;s,
I&#703;tim&#257;d R&#257;y, H&#803;ay&#257;t K&#863;h&#257;n, and one
or two others went with me. On arriving I saw the tiger standing in the
shade of a tree, and wished to fire at him from horseback but found
that my horse was unsteady, and dismounted and aimed and fired my gun.
As I was standing on a height and the tiger below, I did not know
whether it had struck him or not. In a moment of excitement I fired the
gun again, and I think that this time I hit him. The tiger rose and
charged, and wounding the chief huntsman, who had a falcon on his wrist
and happened to be in front of him, sat down again in his own place. In
this state of affairs, placing another gun on a tripod,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4523src" href="#xd24e4523" name=
"xd24e4523src">24</a> I took aim (<i>majr&#257; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb186" href="#v1pb186" name=
"v1pb186">186</a>]</span>giriftam</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4533src" href="#xd24e4533" name="xd24e4533src">25</a>). An&#363;p
R&#257;y stood holding the rest, and had a sword in his belt and a
baton (<i>kutaka</i>) in his hand. B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram was a
short distance off to my left, and R&#257;m D&#257;s and other servants
behind him. Kam&#257;l the huntsman (<i>qar&#257;wul</i>) loaded the
gun and placed it in my hand. When I was about to fire, the tiger came
roaring towards us and charged. I immediately fired. The ball passed
through the tiger&rsquo;s mouth and teeth. The noise of the gun made
him very savage, and the servants who had crowded together could not
stand his charge and fell over one another, so that I, through their
pushing and shock, was moved a couple of paces from my place and fell
down. In fact, I am sure that two or three of them placed their feet on
my chest and passed over me. I&#703;tim&#257;d R&#257;y and the
huntsman Kam&#257;l assisting me, I stood up. At this moment the tiger
made for those who were on the left-hand side. An&#363;p R&#257;y let
the rest slip out of his hand and turned towards the tiger. The tiger,
with the same activity with which he had charged, turned on him, and he
manfully faced him, and struck him twice with both hands on the head
with the stick he had in his hand. The tiger, opening his mouth, seized
both of An&#363;p R&#257;y&rsquo;s arms with it, and bit them so that
his teeth passed through both, but the stick and the bracelets on his
arms were helpful, and did not allow his arms to be destroyed. From the
attack and pushing of the tiger An&#363;p R&#257;y fell down between
the tiger&rsquo;s fore-feet, so that his head and face were opposite
the tiger&rsquo;s chest. At this moment B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram
and R&#257;m D&#257;s came up to the assistance of An&#363;p R&#257;y.
The prince struck the tiger on the loins with his sword, and R&#257;m
D&#257;s also struck him twice with his sword, once on the
shoulder-blade. On the whole it was very warm work, and
H&#803;ay&#257;t K&#863;h&#257;n struck the tiger several blows over
the head with a stick he had in his hand. An&#363;p R&#257;y with force
dragged his arms out of the tiger&rsquo;s mouth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb187" href="#v1pb187" name=
"v1pb187">187</a>]</span>and struck him two or three times on the cheek
with his fist, and rolling over on his side stood up by the force of
his knees. At the time of withdrawing his arms from the tiger&rsquo;s
mouth, as his teeth had passed through them, they were partly torn, and
both his paws passed over his shoulders. When he stood up, the tiger
also stood up and wounded him on the chest with his claws, so that
those wounds troubled him for some days. As the ground was uneven, they
rolled over each other, holding on like two wrestlers. In the place
where I was standing the ground was quite level. An&#363;p R&#257;y
says that God Almighty gave him so much intelligence that he bore the
tiger over deliberately to<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4550src" href=
"#xd24e4550" name="xd24e4550src">26</a> one side (in the original, that
side), and that he knew no more. At this time the tiger left him and
was making off. He in that state of bewilderment raised up his sword
and followed him and struck him on the head. When the tiger turned his
face round, he struck him another blow on the face, so that both his
eyes were cut, and the skin of the eyebrows, which had been severed by
the sword, fell over his eyes. In this state of affairs, a lamp-man of
the name of &#7778;&#257;lih&#803;, as it was time to light the lamps,
came in a hurry and by a blind chance<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4553src" href="#xd24e4553" name="xd24e4553src">27</a> came across
the tiger. The tiger struck him one blow with his paw and knocked him
down. To fall and give up his life were the same thing. Other people
came in and finished the tiger&rsquo;s business. As An&#363;p R&#257;y
had done this service to me and I had witnessed the way in which he
offered his life, after he had recovered from the pain of his wounds
and had the honour of waiting on me, I bestowed on him the title of
An&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb188"

the leader of an army, and the meaning of Singh-dalan is a
tiger-slayer. Giving him a special sword of my own, I increased his
mansab. I gave K&#863;hurram, son of K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am,
who had been appointed to the governorship of the province of Junagadh,
the title of K&#257;mil K&#863;h&#257;n. On Sunday, the 3rd
Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da, I employed myself in fishing, and 766 fish
were caught; these were divided in my presence among the Amirs,

no fish but those that have scales, but not because the professors of
the Shiah faith look on those without scales as unlawful, but the cause
of my aversion is this, that I have heard from old men, and it has
become known to me by experience as well, that fish without scales eat
the flesh of dead animals and fish with scales do not eat it. From this
cause, to eat them is contrary to my disposition. The Shiahs
know<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4582src" href="#xd24e4582" name=
"xd24e4582src">30</a> why they do not eat them and for what reason they
consider them unlawful. One of my home-bred camels that was with me in
the hunt carried five nilgaws that weighed 42 Hindustani maunds. I had
before this sent for Naz&#804;&#299;r&#299; of N&#299;sh&#257;p&#363;r,
who excelled other men in the art of poetry, and passed his time in
Gujarat as a merchant. At this time he came and waited on me, and
imitating a poem of Anwar&#299;,</p>

<p class="par first xd24e4589">laid before me a poem that he had
composed on me. I presented him with 1,000 rupees, a horse, and a robe
of honour as a gift for this poem. I had also sent for H&#803;ak&#299;m
Ham&#299;d Gujar&#257;t&#299;, whom Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n
greatly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb189" href="#v1pb189" name=
"v1pb189">189</a>]</span>praised, and he came and waited on me. His
good qualities and purity were better than his doctoring. He waited on
me for some time. When it became known that there was no physician but
himself in Gujarat, and I found he himself desired leave to go, I gave
him and his sons 1,000 rupees and some shawls, and set aside a whole
village for his maintenance; he went off to his native place quite
happy. Y&#363;suf K&#863;h&#257;n, son of H&#803;usain K&#863;h&#257;n
Tukriyah, came from his jagir and waited on me. On Thursday, the 10th
Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja, was the festival of the Qurb&#257;n (the
sacrifice of Ishmael). As it is forbidden to take life on that day
(Thursday), I ordered that on the Friday they should kill the
sacrificial animals. Having sacrificed three sheep with my own hand, I
mounted to go hunting, and returned when six gharis of night had
passed. On this day was killed a nilgaw (commonly called blue bull) of
the weight of 9 maunds and 35 seers. The story of this nilgaw is
written because it is not devoid of strangeness. In the two past years,
during which I had come to this same place to wander about and hunt I
had shot at him each time with a gun. As the wounds were not in a fatal
place, he had not fallen, but gone off. This time again I saw that
nilgaw in the hunting-ground (<i>s&#863;hik&#257;rg&#257;h</i>), and
the watchman recognized that in the two previous years he had gone away
wounded. In short, I fired at him again three times on that day. It was
in vain. I pursued him rapidly on foot for three kos, but however much
I exerted myself I could not catch him. At last I made a vow that if
this nilgaw fell I would have his flesh cooked, and for the soul of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n would give it to eat to
poor people. I also vowed a muhr and one rupee to my revered father.
Soon after this the nilgaw became worn out with moving, and I ran to
his head and ordered them to make it lawful (cut its throat in the name
of Allah) on the spot, and having brought it to the camp I fulfilled my
vow as I had proposed. They cooked <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb190" href="#v1pb190" name="v1pb190">190</a>]</span>the nilgaw, and
expending the muhr and rupee on sweets. I assembled poor and hungry
people and divided them among them in my own presence. Two or three
days afterwards I saw another nilgaw. However much I exerted myself and
wished he would stand still in one place, so that I might fire at him,
I could get no chance. With my gun on my shoulder I followed him till
near evening until it was sunset, and despaired of killing him.
Suddenly it came across my tongue, &ldquo;K&#863;hw&#257;ja, this
nilgaw also is vowed to you.&rdquo; My speaking and his sitting down
were at one and the same moment. I fired at and hit him, and ordered
him, like the first nilgaw, to be cooked and given to the poor to eat.
On Saturday, the 19th Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja, I fished again. This
time about 330 fish were caught. On the night of Wednesday, the
28th<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4598src" href="#xd24e4598" name=
"xd24e4598src">31</a> of the same month, I encamped at
R&#363;pb&#257;s. As this was one of my fixed hunting-places and there
was an order that no one should hunt in the neighbourhood, a great
number of antelope had come together in the desert there, so much so
that they came into the inhabited parts and were not subject to any
kind of molestation. I hunted for two or three days in those desert
plains, and shot, and hunted with cheetahs many antelopes. As the hour
for entering the city was near, making two halts on the way, I alighted
on the night of Thursday, the 2nd Muharram, in the year 1020 (17th
March, 1611), at the garden of &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q
Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299;, which is near, in fact close to, the city. On
this night many of the servants of the Court, such as K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Jah&#257;n, Daulat K&#863;h&#257;n, and a number who had remained in
the city, came and waited on me. &#298;raj also, whom I had sent for
from the Subah of the Deccan, had the honour of kissing the threshold.
I stayed in that garden also on the Friday. On that day
&#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q presented his own offerings. As this was the
last day for hunting, an order was given <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb191" href="#v1pb191" name="v1pb191">191</a>]</span>that the
duration of the hunt and the number of animals killed should be counted
up to me. The time of the hunt was from the 9th of the month of
&#256;z&#817;ar to the 29th Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817; of the 5th year, or
three months and twenty days. In this time tigers 12, deer
(<i>g&#257;wzan</i>) 1, <i>chik&#257;rah</i> (gazelle) 44,
<i>k&#363;t&#257;h-p&#257;cha</i> (hog-deer) 1 head, fawns 2 head,
black buck 68 head, does 31 head, foxes 4, <i>k&#363;r&#257;ra</i> deer
8, <i>p&#257;tal</i> (?) 1, bears 5, hy&aelig;nas 3, hares 6, nilgaw
108, fish 1,096, eagle 1, bustard 1, peafowl 5, herons 5, partridges 5,
brahmin&#299; ducks (<i>surk&#863;h&#257;b</i>) 1, <i>s&#257;ras</i> 5,
<i>dh&#299;k</i> (?) 1; total, 1,414.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 29th Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;,
corresponding to the 4th Muh&#803;arram, I mounted an elephant and went
to the city. From the garden of &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q to the palace
the distance is a kos and 20 <i>tan&#257;b</i>. I scattered 1,500
rupees to the crowd. At the fixed hour I entered the palace. The bazars
had been decorated with cloths after the manner of the New Year&rsquo;s
feast. As at the hunting-time an order had been given to
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n to prepare in the <i>Mah&#803;all</i>
(Zenanah) a building fit for me to sit in, the said K&#863;hw&#257;ja
had in the space of three months prepared and brought to perfection
this kind of lofty building, and with folded hands (in humility) had
done exceedingly active work. Coming off the dust of the road I entered
that Paradise-like building and went to look round that abode, and it
was very much to my taste. K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n was dignified
with much praise and commendation. The offerings he had prepared were
displayed to me in the same building. Some of these were approved and
accepted and the remainder presented to him.</p>

Apparently we may infer from this that Jah&#257;ng&#299;r did blind or
attempt to blind his son K&#863;husrau, though he says nothing about
it. Else why should this impostor pretend that he had marks of the
blinding? Tavernier says K&#863;husrau was blinded. Du Jarric also
tells us that Jah&#257;ng&#299;r blinded K&#863;husrau on his way back
from Kabul, when he came to the place where K&#863;husrau had fought
the battle. He was blinded by some juice of a plant being poured into
his eyes. The juice resembled milk (qu. <i>Euphorbia</i>). One of his
captains, who was also a judge, was likewise blinded there along with
his son. W. Finch, too, speaks of this outbreak. He also says that
K&#863;husrau was reported to have been blinded on the battlefield with
a glass. Another story was that Jah&#257;ng&#299;r merely caused a
handkerchief to be tied over his eyes and had it sealed with his own
seal. It is mentioned in Whiteway&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rise of the Portuguese
Power in India,&rdquo; p. 165, note, that fifteen relatives of the King
of Ormuz had been blinded by red-hot bowls having been passed close to
their eyes.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd24e4414src">&uarr;</a></p>

corresponding with the 6th Muh&#803;arram<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4644src" href="#xd24e4644" name="xd24e4644src">1</a> (21st March,
1611). The feast of the New Year having been prepared, I seated myself
on the throne of good fortune. The Amirs and all the servants of the
Court enjoyed the good fortune of waiting on me and gave their
congratulations. The offerings of the servants of the Court
M&#299;r&#257;n &#7778;adr Jah&#257;n, &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
F&#299;r&#363;z-jang, and Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n,
were laid before me. On Wednesday, the 8th Muh&#803;arram, the offering
of R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n, who had sent it from Bengal, was laid before
me. On Thursday, the 9th of the same month, S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n and some of the mansabdars, who had come on summons
from the Deccan, waited on me. I gave a jewelled waist-dagger to
Razz&#257;q-wird&#299; &#362;zbeg. On the same day the New Year&rsquo;s
offering of Murtaz&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n was laid before me. He had
prepared all kinds of things. Having inspected all these, I took what I
approved in the shape of valuable jewels, fine cloths, elephants, and
horses and gave back the rest. I presented a jewelled dagger to
Ab&#363;-l-fath&#803; Dakhan&#299;, 3,000 rupees to M&#299;r
&#703;Abdu-llah, and an Iraq horse to Muq&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n. I
increased the rank of S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n, which
was 1,500 personal and 100 horse, by 500 personal and horse. I had
summoned him from the Deccan for the purpose of sending him to Bengal
to Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n, in reality to take his place
permanently, and I entrusted him with the charge of that Subah.
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan laid before me (as offerings)
two rubies, one royal pearl, and ten rings. I gave &#298;raj, the son
of K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, a jewelled dagger. The rank
of K&#863;hurram was 8,000 personal and 5,000 horse; I increased his
personal allowance by 2,000, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb193"

K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, which was 1,500 personal, 1,000 horse by
500 personal, 200 horse. On 24th Muh&#803;arram, 18th Farward&#299;n,
the day of the ascendant, Y&#257;dg&#257;r &#703;Al&#299;
Sult&#804;&#257;n, ambassador of S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s,
ruler of Persia, who had come on a visit of condolence on the death of
the late king and with congratulations on my accession, had the honour
of waiting on me, and laid before me the gifts S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;Abb&#257;s, my brother, had sent. He had brought good horses,
cloth stuffs, and every kind of fitting present. After he had presented
the gifts, on the same day I gave him a superb robe of honour and
30,000 rupees, which were equivalent to 1,000 Persian tumans. He handed
me a letter in which were mingled congratulations and condolences for
the death of my revered father. As in the letter of congratulation he
expressed the greatest friendship, and omitted no point of regard and
concord, it has pleased me to enter here an exact copy of it.</p>

<p class="par first">Although outwardly the distance (between us)
prevents my attaining to the <i>ka&#703;bah</i> of desire, yet he is
the <i>qiblah</i> of my keen longing for spiritual intercourse. Thank
God that by virtue of essential oneness this humble supplicant and that
pure nursling of glory have in reality been united to one another. The
distance of space and outward separation of the body not having
prevented nearness of soul and spiritual union, my face is still
towards friendship, and accordingly the dust of sorrow has not settled
on the sun-like mirror of my mind, but it has received the reflection
of the beauty of that exhibitor of perfection, and the olfactory of my
soul has been ever scented with the sweet savour of friendship and love
and the ambergris-perfumed breezes of affection and concord, and
spiritual fellowship and perpetual union have rubbed off the rust from
friendship.</p>

(<i>maq&#7779;&#363;d</i>), that beauty who for years was hidden behind
the veil, has by dint of humility and supplication at the throne of the
Almighty, come forth and manifested herself from the hidden bridal
chamber, and a ray of perfection has been thrown on the plain of the
hopes of the expectants; she has ascended the auspicious throne and
seated herself beside the king who adorns the assembly and enhances the
glory of the tribune of the king of kings. The world-opening standard
of the Caliphate and rule, and the sky-scraping umbrella of justice and
world-sway of that creator of the diadem and throne, and that opener of
the knots of knowledge and wisdom have cast the shade of equity and
sovereignty and mercy over the heads of the inhabitants of the world.
My hope is that the chief of desire-granters may make the auspicious
ascension of that blessed rising of fortune brighten the crown and
illuminate the throne, making it of good omen and prosperous to all,
and may the things that appertain to kingship and rule of the world and
the causes of dignity and prosperity be ever on the increase! For long
past the customs of amity and the ways of intimacy, which have been in
existence between our ancestors, and now freshly have been
re-established between this one who is bent on friendship and him who
is intent on equity, demanded that when the good news of the accession
of him who sits on the G&#363;rg&#257;n&#299; throne and is the heir of
the crown of T&#299;m&#363;r reached this country, one of the
confidants of the royal palace should be quickly nominated to convey
congratulations, but inasmuch as the business of
&#256;z&#817;arb&#299;j&#257;n and the conquest of the province of
S&#863;hirw&#257;n just then occurred, and until my loving mind was
satisfied as to the affairs of that province, I could not return to my
capital, some delay took place in the accomplishment of this important
duty. Although outward ceremonial observances and politenesses have not
much weight with people of knowledge and discernment, yet the
observance of them is the observance <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

friendship. Of necessity, therefore, at this auspicious time when the
attention of the servants of holy angels (?) has been withdrawn from
the affairs of that province, which have been arranged in accordance
with the desires of my well-wishers, and I am at ease in that quarter,
I have returned and settled down in my capital of Isfahan, which is the
permanent seat of rule. Therefore I have despatched
Kam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n Yadg&#257;r &#703;Al&#299;, who possesses the
attributes of nobility, is perfect in sincerity and fully reliable, who
is moreover of the number of devoted servants and S&#363;f&#299;s of
pure design of our family, to the most exalted Court, that after he has
obtained the good fortune to salute you, to condole with you, and
kissed the carpet of honour, and performed the dues of inquiry (after
health, etc.) and congratulations, he may obtain leave to return, and
may convey to the sincere mind of your well-wisher the good tidings of
the safety of your angelic person and the health of your temperament
that is of the brightness of the sun and increases joy. It is hoped
that the tree of hereditary friendship and assiduousness, and the
garden of intimacy and regard, both apparent and spiritual, which by
the irrigation of the rivers of affection and the brooks of sincere
regard acquire great splendour and greenness, not casting their leaves,
may set in motion the cord of intimacy and drive away the misfortune of
estrangement by the arrival of correspondence, which is the
communication of the soul, and may connect by spiritual chains our
visible friendship, and may favour the course and accomplishment of
business.</p>

<p class="par">Up to this is the copy of the letter of my brother
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s.</p>
<p class="par">My brothers Sult&#804;&#257;n Mur&#257;d and
D&#257;niy&#257;l, who had died in the lifetime of my revered father,
people had called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb197" href=
"#v1pb197" name="v1pb197">197</a>]</span>by several names. I ordered
that one of them should be called S&#863;h&#257;hz&#257;da
mag&#863;hf&#363;r (the pardoned prince), and the other
S&#863;h&#257;hz&#257;da marh&#803;&#363;m (the prince admitted to
mercy). I promoted I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah and
&#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299;, who each held the rank
of 1,500, to that of 1,800, and increased the horse-rank of Q&#257;sim
K&#863;h&#257;n, brother of Isl&#257;m <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e4694" title="Source: Kkankhanan">Khankhanan</span>, by 250. I
dignified &#298;raj, eldest son of the Khankhanan, with the title of
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n, and Sa&#703;du-llah, son of
Sa&#703;&#299;d K&#863;h&#257;n, with the appellation of
Naw&#257;zis&#863;h K&#863;h&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">At the time of my accession I had increased weights and
measures (lit. <i>gaz</i>), viz. to the extent of three ratis (small
weight equal to eight barleycorns), in the weight of muhrs and rupees.
At this time it was represented to me that in mercantile transactions
it would be for the convenience of the people that muhrs and rupees
should be of the same weight as previously. As in all affairs the
contentment and ease of the people are to be looked to, I gave an order
that from the present day, that is, the 11th Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht in
the 6th year of my reign, they should strike muhrs and rupees of the
former weight in all the mints of my dominions. As before this, on
Saturday, the 2nd of the month of &#7778;afar, in the year 1020, the
evil-dispositioned Ah&#803;d&#257;d had heard that Kabul was deprived
of an eminent leader, that K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4702src" href="#xd24e4702" name="xd24e4702src">2</a>
was in the interior, and only Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk with a few servants
of the aforesaid was in Kabul, thinking it a good opportunity he
(Ah&#803;d&#257;d) betook himself unexpectedly to Kabul with a large
number of horsemen and foot-soldiers. Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk, according to
the measure of his ability, displayed activity, and the Kabulis and
other inhabitants, especially the Farmul&#299;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4705src" href="#xd24e4705" name="xd24e4705src">3</a> tribe,
barricaded up the streets and fortified their houses. The Afghans with
some guns came in to the streets and bazars <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb198" href="#v1pb198" name=
"v1pb198">198</a>]</span>from different directions. The people from the
shelter of their terraces and houses killed many of these wretches with
arrows and guns, and Barg&#299;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4710src"
href="#xd24e4710" name="xd24e4710src">4</a> one of the confidential
leaders of Ah&#803;d&#257;d, was killed. From the occurrence of this
affair, for fear that the people from all sides and quarters should
assemble and block the road for them to get out, giving up their hearts
and feet (in a state of distraction), in fear and confusion they turned
back. About 800 of those dogs went to jahannam (hell), and 200, having
caught horses, hastily escaped with their lives from that deadly place.
N&#257;d &#703;Al&#299; Maid&#257;n&#299;, who was in Lah&#363;gar, at
last on the same day arrived there, and pursued them for a short
distance. As the distance (between them) was too great and his band
small, he turned back. For the energy he had shown in coming quickly,
and for the activity displayed by Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk, they were both
promoted in rank; N&#257;d &#703;Al&#299;, who held that of 1,000
personal to that of 1,500, and Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk, who held the rank
of 1,500, to 1,800. As it transpired that K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n
and the Kabulis were in the habit of passing their days in
carelessness, and the repelling of the evil disposition of
Ah&#803;d&#257;d had taken a long time it occurred to me that as the
Khankhanan was without employment I might appoint him and his sons to
this duty. Soon after this idea occurred, Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n,
to summon whom a firman had already been issued, came from the Panjab
and obtained the honour of an audience. It became evident from the
forehead of his circumstances (his manner) that he was annoyed at the
duty of driving back the ill-dispositioned Ah&#803;d&#257;d being
assigned to K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n. As he faithfully
promised to take up this duty, it was settled that the governorship of
the Subah of the Panjab should belong to Murtaz&#803;&#257;
K&#863;h&#257;n, and that the Khankhanan should remain at home, and
that Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n should be promoted to the rank of 6,000
personal and 5,000 horse, and be appointed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb199" href="#v1pb199" name=
"v1pb199">199</a>]</span>to Kabul to drive back Ah&#803;d&#257;d and
the up-country robbers. I ordered the Khankhanan to have a jagir in the
Subah of Agra in the Sarkars of Qanauj and Kalpi, that he might inflict
condign punishment on the rebels of that region and exterminate them
(pull them out by the roots). When I dismissed them I gave each of them
special robes of honour and horses and elephants, and having received
the robes of exaltation they started <span class="corr" id="xd24e4716"
title="Source: of">off</span>. At the same time, on account of the
sincerity of his friendship and his old services, I bestowed on
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah the rank of 2,000 personal and 500 horse,
and presented him with a sum of 5,000 rupees by way of gift.
Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n, whom I had sent to make the necessary
preparations for war for the victorious army of the Deccan and point
out to the Amirs the desirability of concord and unanimity, paid his
respects to me at the capital of Agra on the 12th of the month of
T&#299;r, the 21st of Rab&#299;&#703;u-s&#804;-s&#804;&#257;n&#299;. It
was brought to notice in a letter from Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n that
&#703;In&#257;yat K&#863;h&#257;n had performed approved service in the
Subah of Bengal; on this account I increased by 500 personal the rank
he already held of 2,000. I also increased by 500 personal and 300
horse, so as to make it up altogether to 1,500 personal and 800 horse,
the rank of R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n, who was one of the officials of that
Subah. I appointed H&#257;s&#863;him K&#863;h&#257;n,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e4719src" href="#xd24e4719" name="xd24e4719src">5</a> who was
in Orissa, to the government of Kashmir, and sent his uncle,
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain, there to look after the
affairs of that country until his arrival. In the time of my revered
father his father, Muh&#803;ammad Q&#257;sim, had conquered Kashmir.
Ch&#299;n Qil&#299;j, who was the eldest son of Qil&#299;j
K&#863;h&#257;n, came from the Subah of Kabul and waited on me. As in
addition to his natural excellence he was a

"v1pb200">200</a>]</span>to the prayer of his father, and on condition
of his undertaking service in T&#299;rah, I increased his rank by 500
personal and 300 horse. On the 14th Amard&#257;d on account of the
previous service and great sincerity and ability of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-daulah, I bestowed on him the high rank of the
viziership of the kingdom, and on the same day presented a belt with a
jewelled dagger to Y&#257;dg&#257;r &#703;Al&#299;, ambassador of the
ruler of Iran. As &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been
appointed to command the army against the rebel R&#257;n&#257;,
promised to enter the province of the Deccan from the direction of
Gujarat, I promoted him to be Subahdar of that province, and at his
request appointed R&#257;ja B&#257;so to the command of the army
against the R&#257;n&#257;, increasing his rank by 500 horse. In place
of Gujarat I conferred the Subah of Malwa on K&#863;h&#257;n
A&#703;z&#804;am and sent 400,000 rupees to provide for the army and
warlike materials for the force that had been appointed to accompany
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n by way of N&#257;sik, which is near the
province of the Deccan. &#7778;afdar K&#863;h&#257;n, with his
brothers, came from the Subah of Behar, and had the honour of kissing
the threshold.</p>
<p class="par">One of the royal slaves who was serving in the

his back. Five servants were standing around and before him, and
tree-boughs threw a shade over the throne. In the third compartment is
a company of rope-dancers, who have raised upright a pole with three
ropes fastened to it. A rope-dancer upon it (qu. on the ropes?<a class=

on the top of the pole. Another person has thrown a drum on his neck
and is beating it, whilst another man is standing with his hands lifted
up and looking at the rope-dancer. Five other men are also standing, of
whom one has a stick in his hand. In the fourth compartment there is a

him in order that he might in every place look after him, and not allow
him to be too rash and hasty. For this purpose I bestowed on him great
favours, as well as the title of Raja, which he had not thought of for
himself. I also gave him drums and the fort of Ranthanb&#363;r, which
is one of the noted castles in Hindustan, and honouring him with a

K&#863;h&#257;n Dakhan&#299; with 4,000 rupees. On the 7th
&#256;b&#257;n Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, son of M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, came from the Deccan and waited on me.</p>
<p class="par">About this time, in consequence of the disturbances that
had occurred in the country of M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr, many of
the Amirs and &#362;zbeg soldiers, such as H&#803;usain B&#299;,
Pahluw&#257;n B&#257;b&#257;, and Nauras B&#299; Darman, and Baram
B&#299; and others came to Court and waited on me. They were all
honoured with robes of honour, horses, cash, mansabs, and jagirs. On
the 2nd &#256;z&#817;ar H&#257;s&#863;him K&#863;h&#257;n came from
Bengal and had the honour of kissing my threshold. I sent 500,000
rupees for the expenses of the victorious army of the Deccan, of which
the leader was &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, to Ahmadabad in Gujarat
by the hands of R&#363;p K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; and
S&#863;haik&#863;h Anbiy&#257;. On the 1st day I went to the village of
Samonagar, which is one of my fixed hunting-places, to hunt. Twenty-two
antelope were killed, of which I myself killed sixteen and
K&#863;hurram the other six. Remaining <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb203" href="#v1pb203" name="v1pb203">203</a>]</span>there two days
and two nights, on the night of Sunday I returned to the city in health
and safety, and one night this couplet threw its brilliance on my
mind:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;As long as there&rsquo;s in heaven light for the
sun,</p>
<p class="line">Be not the reflection far from the Shah&rsquo;s
umbrella.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">I ordered the lamplighters and the relators of
stories that at the time of their salutations and telling stories they
should commence with this couplet, and it is still in use. On Saturday,
the 3rd day, a letter came from K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am that
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n B&#299;j&#257;p&#363;r&#299; had given
up his evil ways and become penitent, and in the rank of servants was
now more loyal than ever. On the 14th day, corresponding with the last
day of S&#863;haww&#257;l, leave was given to H&#257;s&#863;him
K&#863;h&#257;n to go to Kashmir. I gave a special wrapper<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4782src" href="#xd24e4782" name=
"xd24e4782src">10</a> (<i>fargal</i>) to Y&#257;dg&#257;r
&#703;Al&#299;, ambassador of Persia. I presented I&#703;tiq&#257;d
K&#863;h&#257;n with one of my special swords called Sar-and&#257;z
(thrower of heads). Having honoured S&#863;h&#257;dm&#257;n, son of
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, with the title of
S&#863;h&#257;dm&#257;n K&#863;h&#257;n, I increased his rank to 1,700
personal and 500 horse. He was also honoured with a standard.
Sard&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, brother of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
F&#299;r&#363;z-jang, and Arsl&#257;n B&#299; &#362;zbeg, who had been
appointed to the charge of S&#299;vist&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4788src" href="#xd24e4788" name="xd24e4788src">11</a> were also
presented with standards. I ordered that
<i>j&#257;&#702;i-nam&#257;z</i> (prayer carpets) should be made of the
skins of the antelopes I had myself killed, and be kept in the public
audience hall for people to use in saying their prayers. By way of
special respect to the Law I ordered that the M&#299;r-i-&#703;Adl and
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299;, who are the pivot of affairs of the divine law,
should not kiss the ground (before me), which is a kind of
<i>sijda</i>. On Thursday, the 22nd day, I went again to Samonagar to
hunt. As many antelope had collected together in that neighbourhood I
had this time sent off K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n to prepare a
qamargah and drive in the antelope into a broad place from all sides,
to place canvas-walls <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb204" href=
"#v1pb204" name="v1pb204">204</a>]</span>(<i>sar&#257;-parda</i>) and a
<i>gul&#257;l-b&#257;&#7771;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e4805src"
href="#xd24e4805" name="xd24e4805src">12</a> round it. They enclosed a
kos and half of ground with sarapardas. When news came that the
hunting-place had been prepared and a great deal of game had been
confined, I went there and began to hunt on the Friday. Until the next
Thursday I went every day to the qamargah with the ladies and hunted as
much as I liked. Some of the deer were taken alive and some killed with
arrows and guns. On the Sunday and Thursday, on which I do not fire
guns at animals, they took them alive in nets. In these seven days 917
head, male and female, were caught, and of these 641 deer were caught
alive. Four hundred and four head were sent to Fath&#803;p&#363;r to be
let loose on the plain there, and with regard to 84 I ordered them to
put silver rings in their noses and set them free in the same place.
The 276 other antelope that had been killed with guns and arrows and by
cheetahs were divided from day to day among the Begams and the slaves
of the palace, and Amirs and servants of the palace. As I became very
tired (<i>dilg&#299;r</i>) of hunting, I gave orders to the Amirs to go
to the <i>s&#863;hik&#257;rg&#257;h</i> (hunting-place) and hunt all
that were left over, and myself returned in safety to the city. On the
1st Bahman, corresponding with the 17th Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da, I
ordered that in the large cities of my dominions, like Ahmadabad,
Allahabad, Lahore, Delhi, Agra, etc., they should arrange
bulg&#863;hur-k&#863;h&#257;nas (places for the distribution of cooked
food) for the poor; thirty mahalls (districts) had been ordered. Six
had already been established, and twenty-four other districts were now
ordered. On the 4th Bahman I increased the rank of R&#257;ja B&#299;r
Singh Deo by 1,000 personal; it was previously 4,000 personal and 2,000
horse: I gave him a jewelled sword. Another sword out of my special
ones, that was called S&#863;h&#257;h-bacha, (king&rsquo;s child), was
presented to S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 16th
Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;, Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, son of
M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb205" href="#v1pb205" name=
"v1pb205">205</a>]</span>was appointed to the army against the rebel
R&#257;n&#257; and a sword sent by his hand for R&#257;ja B&#257;so.
Having again heard that the Amirs on the borders interfere with
authority in matters that do not concern them, and do not observe laws
and regulations, I ordered<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4817src" href=
"#xd24e4817" name="xd24e4817src">13</a> that the Bakhshis should
circulate orders, to be obeyed amongst the Amirs of the borders, that
hereafter they should not interfere in such things, which are the
private affair of kings. The first thing is this, that they should not
sit in the <i>jharokha</i> (private window), and should not trouble
their officers and captains of the auxiliaries with keeping guard or
saluting them, and should not have elephant fights, and should not
inflict the punishment of blinding, and should not cut off ears and
noses, and should not force Islam on anyone, and should not confer
titles on their servants, and should not order the royal servants to do
<i>k&#363;rnis&#863;h</i> or prostration, and should not force singers
to remain on duty in the manner customary in (royal) darbars, and
should not beat drums when they go out, and when they give a horse or
elephant to anyone, whether to the king&rsquo;s attendants or to their
own servants, they should not place reins or elephant&rsquo;s goads on
their backs and make them perform obeisance. In going in procession
they should not take with them on foot in their retinue the royal
attendants. If they write anything to them they should not put a seal
on it.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4826src" href="#xd24e4826" name=

<h2 class="main">The Seventh New Year&rsquo;s Festival after the
auspicious Accession.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On Tuesday, the 1st Farward&#299;n of the seventh
year from my accession on the 16th Muh&#803;arram u-l-h&#803;ar&#257;m
(19th March, 1612) in the year 1021, the New Year&rsquo;s assembly that
illuminates the world, and the festival that brings joy, were held in
the capital of Agra. After four gharis of the night had passed on
Thursday, the 3rd of the aforesaid month, the hour that the astrologers
had chosen, I sat on the throne. I had ordered that, according to
annual custom, the bazars should be decorated and the assembly should
be kept up until the day of culmination
(<i>r&#363;z-i-s&#863;haraf</i>). K&#863;husrau B&#299; &#362;zbeg, who
was known among the Uzbegs as K&#863;husrau
<i>Qimch&#299;</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4852src" href=
"#xd24e4852" name="xd24e4852src">1</a> came on these days and had the
honour of waiting on me. As he was one of the influential men of
M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr, I bestowed many favours on him, and
gave him a fine robe of honour. I gave 15,000 rupees to
Y&#257;dg&#257;r &#703;Al&#299;, ambassador of the ruler of Iran, for
his expenses. On the same day the offering of Afz&#803;al
K&#863;h&#257;n, which he had sent from the Subah of Behar, was laid
before me. There were 30 elephants and 18 ponies
(<i>g&#363;n&#7789;h</i>), and pieces of Bengal cloth, sandalwood, some
pods of musk, aloes-wood (<i>Agallochum</i>), and all kinds of things.
The offering of K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n was also produced before
me. He had sent 45 head of horse and two strings of camels, porcelain
from China, dressing-gowns (<i>p&#363;st&#299;nh&#257;</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4866src" href="#xd24e4866" name=
"xd24e4866src">2</a>) of sable (<i>samm&#363;r</i>), and other valuable
presents procurable in Kabul and its neighbourhood. The officers of the
palace had taken trouble about their offerings, and according to the
yearly custom from day to day of the festival the offerings of the
servants were laid before me. Having looked at them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb207" href="#v1pb207" name=
"v1pb207">207</a>]</span>in detail, I took what I approved and gave
them the remainder. On the 13th Farward&#299;n, corresponding with the
29th Muh&#803;arram, a representation from Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n
arrived to the effect that through the blessing of Allah&rsquo;s favour
and through the benign influence of the royal grace, Bengal had been
freed from the disturbance of &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n, the Afghan.
Before the circumstances of this war are written down, some particulars
with regard to Bengal will be recorded.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4880src" href="#xd24e4880" name="xd24e4880src">3</a> Bengal is a
country of great extent, and in the second clime its length, from the
port of Chittagong to Gar&#299;, is 450 kos; and its breadth, from the
Northern hills to the boundary of Sarkar Mad&#257;ran, 220 kos. Its
revenue is about 60 krores of dams.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4883src"
href="#xd24e4883" name="xd24e4883src">4</a> The former rulers of this
place always had 20,000 horse, a lakh of foot-soldiers, 1,000
elephants, and 4,000 or 5,000 war-boats. From the time of
S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n and his son Sal&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n,
this country was in the possession of the Afghans. When the throne of
sovereignty of Hindustan in the hands of my revered father acquired
beauty and splendour, he ordered the victorious forces (of the empire)
into it, and for a long time made the conquest of it his object, until
the aforesaid province, through the great efforts of the chiefs of the
victorious State, passed from the possession of D&#257;&#702;&#363;d
Kar&#257;n&#299;, who was the last of its rulers. That wretch was
killed in the fight with K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, and his army
became scattered and in desperate condition. From that date until now
the province is in the possession of the servants of the State. In the
end a few of the remaining Afghans had remained in the corners and
sides of the country, and kept a few distant places in their
possession, until, by degrees, most of that body became despised and
helpless, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb208" href="#v1pb208" name=
"v1pb208">208</a>]</span>and were captured by the chiefs of the State
in the places of which they had still possession. When the arrangement
of the affairs of rule and empire, simply through the grace of God,
became entrusted to this humble servant of the throne of Allah, in the
first year after my accession I sent for R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh, who
had been appointed to the rule and government of that place, to Court,
and sent Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n, who, out of all the
officials, was distinguished as my foster-brother, in his place. As he
entered the province he attained to martyrdom at the hand of one of
those mischievous ones who had been appointed to that country, and that
man, who had not thought of the consequences, also obtained the reward
of his deeds, and was slain. I promoted Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was governor and a Jagirdar in the province of
Behar, on account of his nearness to that neighbourhood, to the rank of
5,000 personal and horse, and ordered him to go to Bengal and take
possession of the province. I sent an order to Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was at the capital of Agra, to go to Behar and
consider that province his jagir. When a short time had passed under
the rule of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, he contracted
a severe illness, in consequence of the bad water and air of that
place, and by degrees the power of the disease and his weakness became
so great as to end in his destruction. When the news of his death came
to my hearing at Lahore, an order was issued in the name of Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n to proceed as soon as possible to Bengal. When I
appointed him to this important duty, most of the servants of the State
made remarks on his youth and want of experience. As the excellence of
his disposition and his natural capacity had been noticed by my
judicious eye, I myself chose him for this duty. As it happened, the
affairs of this province were carried on by him in such a manner as
from the time when it first entered into the possession of the Chiefs
of the everlasting State until this day has never been attained to by
any of the servants of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb209" href=
"#v1pb209" name="v1pb209">209</a>]</span>the Court. One of his
noteworthy deeds was the driving away of the rebel
&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n, the Afghan. He frequently in the time of the
late king encountered the royal forces, but his expulsion was not
accomplished. When Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n made Dhaka (Dacca) his
place of abode and made the subjection of the Zamindars of that
neighbourhood his chief object, it occurred to him that he should send
an army against the rebel &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n and his province. If
he agreed to serve loyally, well and good, but if not, they should
punish and annihilate him like other seditious people. At that time

service<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4894src" href="#xd24e4894" name=

K&#863;h&#257;n, Iftik&#863;h&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, Sayyid &#256;dam
B&#257;rha, S&#863;haik&#863;h Achhay,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4897src" href="#xd24e4897" name="xd24e4897src">7</a> nephew of
Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n, Mu&#703;tamad K&#863;h&#257;n, the sons of
Mu&#703;az&#804;z&#804;am K&#863;h&#257;n Ihtim&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n,
and others. He took with him also some of his own men. At the hour when
Mus&#863;htar&#299; (Jupiter) was propitious, he started off this band,
and appointed M&#299;r Q&#257;sim, son of M&#299;rz&#257; Mur&#257;d,
its chief paymaster and news-writer. He took also some of the Zamindars
with him to show the road. The victorious armies started. When they
reached the neighbourhood of &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n&rsquo;s fort and
land, they sent some eloquent men to admonish him and point out to him
the way of loyalty, and bring him back from the road of rebellion to
the right path. As much pride had seated itself in his brain-cup, and
he had in his head a desire to seize the country, beside other fancies,
he turned a deaf ear to their words and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb210" href="#v1pb210" name="v1pb210">210</a>]</span>prepared
himself for conflict and fight. The battlefield happened to be on the
bank of a nullah in a place which was a complete bog. On Sunday (12th
March, 1612), the 9th Muh&#803;arram, S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n, choosing the hour for the fight, arrayed the
victorious forces, so that everyone should go to his place and be
prepared for the battle. &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n had not settled the
battle for that day with himself. When he heard that the royal army had
come prepared for battle, having no remedy he himself mounted and came
to the bank of the nullah, and arrayed his own horse and foot opposite
the victorious army. When the affair grew hot, and the two forces
opposed each other, that foolish, obstinate man at the first onset
threw his own fighting raging elephant against the advanced guard.
After much fighting many of the leaders of the advanced guard, as
Sayyid &#256;dam<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4908src" href="#xd24e4908"
name="xd24e4908src">8</a> B&#257;rha and S&#863;haik&#863;h Achhay,
attained the dignity of martyrdom. Iftik&#863;h&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n,
the leader of the right wing, was in no way remiss in attacking, and
sacrificed his own life. The band that was with him fought to such a
degree that they were all cut to pieces. In the same way
Kis&#863;hwar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4911src" href="#xd24e4911"
name="xd24e4911src">9</a> K&#863;h&#257;n and his band of the left wing
bravely sacrificed themselves in the affair of their master, but many
of the enemy (lit. those of dark fortune) were also wounded and killed.
That evil one (&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n) took account of the combatants
and ascertained that the leaders of the advanced guard and right and
left wings were killed. The centre alone remained. He took no account
of the killed and wounded on his own side, but attacked the centre (of
the royal army) with the same energy. On this side the son and brothers
and sons-in-law of S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n, as well as
other officers, stopped the advance of those lost ones, and attacked
them like tigers and leopards armed with claws and teeth. Some of them
attained the dignity of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb211" href=
"#v1pb211" name="v1pb211">211</a>]</span>martyrdom, and those that
remained alive bore away fatal wounds. At this time
(&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n) drove a raging elephant of the name of
Gajpat,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4916src" href="#xd24e4916" name=
"xd24e4916src">10</a> which was his premier elephant, at
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n, who laid hold of his spear
and struck the elephant. What does a raging elephant care for a
javelin. He then seized his sword and struck him two blows one after
another. How did he regard these either! He then drew his dagger and
struck him twice with it, but for this, too, he did not turn back, but
overthrew S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n with his horse.
Immediately he was separated from his horse; calling out
&ldquo;Jah&#257;ng&#299;r S&#863;h&#257;h,&rdquo; he leapt up, and his
equerry struck the elephant on both front legs a blow with a two-handed
sword. As the elephant fell on his knees, the equerry pulled the
elephant driver down off the elephant, and S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
with the dagger he had in his hand, and while on foot, struck such
blows on the trunk and forehead of the elephant that the elephant
roared out at the pain and turned round. As he was severely wounded, he
went to his own army and fell down. S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s horse got up safely. As he was mounting his
horse those vile ones drove another elephant at his standard-bearer,
and overthrew his horse and standard. S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n gave a manly shout and roused the standard-bearer,
saying: &ldquo;Be bold: I&rsquo;m alive and the standard is at my feet
(?).&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4919src" href="#xd24e4919" name=
"xd24e4919src">11</a> At this critical moment all the servants of the
State who were present seized their arrows and daggers and swords, and
smote the elephant. S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at himself came up and
shouted to the standard-bearer to rise, and got another horse for the
standard-bearer and mounted him on it. The standard-bearer unfurled the
standard and maintained his ground. At the time of this struggle
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb212" href="#v1pb212" name=
"v1pb212">212</a>]</span>a (ball from a) gun struck that rebel on his
forehead. However much they enquired for the man who fired it he could
not be found. When this struck him, he recognized that he was a dead
man. Yet for two watches, notwithstanding this fatal wound, he urged on
his men to the fight, and the battlefield was still deadly and the
struggle warm. Afterwards the enemy turned their faces, and the
victorious army pursued them, and continually striking them drove back
those vile ones into the place where they had encamped. With arrows and
guns those wretches would not allow the royal troops to enter the place
where they were. When Wal&#299;, the brother of &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n,
and Mamrez, his (&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n&rsquo;s) son and other
relations and followers became aware of &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n&rsquo;s
wound, they made up their minds that he would not recover from it, and
that if they, defeated and put to flight, should go towards their fort
none would reach it alive. They thought it best to remain for the night
in the place where they had encamped, and towards the end of the night
seek an opportunity and get to their fort. Two watches of night had
passed when &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n went to hell. In the third watch
they raised his lifeless body, and leaving his tent and the things they
had with them in the camp, proceeded to their fortress. The scouts of
the victorious army, having obtained news of this, informed
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n. On the morning of Monday the
loyalists assembled and decided to follow them, and not allow
breathing-time to those of dark fortune. In the end, in consequence of
the tired state of the soldiers, and in order to bury the martyrs and
out of sympathy for the wounded, they were perplexed in their minds as
to going or settling down (where they were). Just at this time
&#703;Abdu-s-Sal&#257;m, son of Mu&#703;az&#804;z&#804;am
K&#863;h&#257;n, arrived with a body of servants of the State,
altogether 300 horse and 400 musketeers (<i>t&#363;pch&#299;</i>). When
this fresh body of men arrived it was determined to pursue, and they
accordingly went on. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb213" href=
"#v1pb213" name="v1pb213">213</a>]</span>When Wal&#299;, who after
&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n was the stock of the disturbance, learned that
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n with the victorious army had
come together with another fresh force, he saw no resource for himself
but to go to S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n on the straight
line of faith and loyalty. In the end he sent a message that he who had
been the cause of the disturbance had gone, and that the body of those
who were left were servants and Musulmans. If he would give his word
they would wait upon him and would agree to serve the State, giving
their elephants as an offering. S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n and Mu&#703;taqid K&#863;h&#257;n, who had arrived on
the day of the battle and had done approved service, and all those who
were loyal, in accordance with the necessity of the time and with what
was best for the State, gave their word and encouraged them. On the
next day, Wal&#299; and the sons, brothers, and sons-in-law of
&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n all came and waited upon
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n and the other servants of the
State. They brought forty-nine elephants as an offering. After the
completion of this work S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n,
leaving some of the royal servants in Adh&#257;r<a class="noteref" id=

neighbourhood which was in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb214"
href="#v1pb214" name="v1pb214">214</a>]</span>possession of that one of
evil fortune, took with him Wal&#299; and the other Afghans, and on
Monday, the 6th of the month of &#7778;afar, came to
Jah&#257;ng&#299;rnagar (Dacca) and joined Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n.
When the joyful news reached in Agra this supplicant at the throne of
Allah, he performed the prostrations of gratitude, and recognized that
the driving away of this description of enemy was brought about simply
through the unstinted mercy of the Almighty Giver. As a reward for this
good service I promoted Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n to the rank of 6,000
personal, and honoured S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n with
the title of &ldquo;Rustam of the age&rdquo; (Rustam-zam&#257;n), as
well as increased his rank by 1,000 personal and horse. I also
increased the rank of other servants according to the measure of their
services, and they were selected for other honours.</p>
<p class="par">When this news first came of the killing of
&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n it appeared to be a joke, but by way of
ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the words I took an omen from
the div&#257;n of the tongue of the unseen world, K&#863;hw&#257;ja
H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804; of Shiraz, and this g&#863;hazal<a class=

<p class="par">As this couplet was very appropriate to the occasion, I
drew an omen from it. After some days news came again that the arrow of
Fate, or rather of God, had struck &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n, for however
much they enquired for him, he who fired the shot was not made
manifest. This has been recorded on account of its strange nature.</p>
<p class="par">On the 16th Farward&#299;n, Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n,
who is one of my chief retainers and the old confidants of the
Jahangiri service, who had attained the rank of 3,000 personal and
2,000 horse, came from the fort of Cambay and had the honour of waiting
on me. I had ordered him, on account of certain business, to go to the
port of Goa<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4987src" href="#xd24e4987" name=
"xd24e4987src">14</a> and buy for the private use of the government
certain rareties procurable there. According to orders he went with
diligence to Goa, and remaining there for some time, took at the price
the Franks asked for them the rareties he met with at that port,
without looking at the face of the money at all (i.e. regardless of
cost). When he returned from the aforesaid port to the Court, he
produced before me one by one the things and rareties he had brought.
Among these were some animals that were very strange and wonderful,
such as I had never seen, and up to this time no one had known their
names. Although King B&#257;bar has described in his Memoirs the
appearance and shapes of several animals, he had never ordered the
painters to make pictures of them. As these animals appeared to me to
be very strange, I both described them and ordered that painters should
draw them in the Jah&#257;ng&#299;r-n&#257;ma, so that the amazement
that arose from hearing of them might be increased. One of these
animals in body is larger than a peahen and smaller than a
peacock.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4990src" href="#xd24e4990" name=
"xd24e4990src">15</a> When <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb216" href=
"#v1pb216" name="v1pb216">216</a>]</span>it is in heat and displays
itself, it spreads out its feathers like the peacock and dances about.
Its beak and legs are like those of a cock. Its head and neck and the
part under the throat are every minute of a different colour. When it
is in heat it is quite red&mdash;one might say it had adorned itself
with red coral&mdash;and after a while it becomes white in the same
places, and looks like cotton. It sometimes looks of a turquoise
colour. Like a chameleon it constantly changes colour. Two pieces of
flesh it has on its head look like the comb of a cock. A strange thing
is this, that when it is in heat the aforesaid piece of flesh hangs
down to the length of a span from the top of its head like an
elephant&rsquo;s trunk, and again when he raises it up it appears on
its head like the horn of a rhinoceros, to the extent of two
finger-breadths. Round its eyes it is always of a turquoise colour, and
does not change. Its feathers appear to be of various colours,
differing from the colours of the peacock&rsquo;s feathers. He also
brought a monkey of a strange and wonderful form. Its hands, feet,
ears, and head are like those of a monkey, and its face like that of a
fox. The colour of its eyes is like that of a hawk&rsquo;s eye, but the
eyes are larger than those of a hawk. From its head to the end of its
tail it is an ordinary cubit in length. It is lower than a monkey and
taller than a fox. Its hair is like the wool of a sheep and its colour
like that of ashes. From the lobe of its ear to its chin it is red and
of the colour of wine. Its tail is two or three finger-breadths longer
than half a cubit, quite different from that of other monkeys. The tail
of this animal hangs down like the tail of a cat. Sometimes it makes a
sound like a young antelope. On the whole it is a very strange beast.
Of the wild birds which they call <i>tadr&#363;</i> (pheasant) till now
it has never been heard that they breed in captivity. In the time of my
revered father they made great efforts to obtain eggs and young ones
but it was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb217" href="#v1pb217" name=
"v1pb217">217</a>]</span>not managed. I ordered them to keep some of
them, male and female, in one place, and by degrees they bred. I
ordered them to place the eggs under hens, and in a space of two years
sixty or seventy young were produced and fifty or sixty grew up.
Whoever heard of this matter was astonished. It was said that in the
Wil&#257;yat (Persia?) the people there had made great efforts, but no
eggs were produced and no young were obtained.</p>
<p class="par">In these days I increased the mansab of Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n by 1,000 personal and 500 horse, which thus became
4,000 personal and 3,500 horse. The mansab of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, original and increased, was fixed at 4,000
personal and 1,000 horse. To the mansab of Mah&#257; Singh also an
increase of 500 personal and horse was given: it was originally and
with increase 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse. The mansab of
I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n was increased by 500 personal and 200
horse, and made up to 1,000 personal and 300 horse. K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan in these days came from the Deccan and waited on
me. Daulat K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been appointed to the
faujd&#257;rship of Allahabad and of the Sarkar of Jaunpur, came and
paid his respects: an increase of 500 was made to his mansab, which was
1,000. On the day of culmination (<i>r&#363;z-i-s&#863;haraf</i>),
which was the 19th Farward&#299;n, I raised the mansab of
Sult&#804;&#257;n K&#863;hurram, which was 10,000, to 12,000, and made
that of I&#703;tib&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, which was 3,000 personal and
1,000 horse, up to 4,000. I raised the mansab of Muqarrab
K&#863;h&#257;n from 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse by 500 personal and
horse; and increased that of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, which was
2,000 personal and 1,200 horse, by 500. As these were the days of the
New Year, many of the servants (of the State) obtained an increase of
their mansabs. On the same day Dul&#299;p came from the Deccan and
waited on me. As his father R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh had died, I
honoured him with the title of R&#257;y and clothed him in a dress of
honour. R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh had another son, by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb218" href="#v1pb218" name=
"v1pb218">218</a>]</span>name S&#363;raj Singh. Although Dul&#299;p was
his <i>&#7789;&#299;k&#257;</i> (marked with the
<i>&#7789;&#299;k&#257;</i>) son, he wished S&#363;raj Singh to succeed
him, in consequence of the love that he bore to his mother. When the
circumstances of his death were reported to me, S&#363;raj Singh, in
consequence of his want of intelligence and tender years, represented
to me: &ldquo;My father has made me his successor and given me the
<i>&#7789;&#299;k&#257;</i>.&rdquo; This remark was not to my liking,
and I said: &ldquo;If thy father has given the
<i>&#7789;&#299;k&#257;</i> to thee, we shall give it to
Dul&#299;p.&rdquo; Then marking the <i>&#7789;&#299;k&#257;</i> with my
own hand, I presented the latter with his father&rsquo;s jagir and
hereditary possessions. I bestowed on I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah an
inkstand and jewelled pen. R&#363;dar, the father of Lakhm&#299; Chand,
Raja of Kumaon, who is one of the considerable Rajas of the hill
country, had come in the time of the late King Akbar,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e5029src" href="#xd24e5029" name="xd24e5029src">16</a> and when
he came had petitioned<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5032src" href=
"#xd24e5032" name="xd24e5032src">17</a> that the son of R&#257;ja
&#7788;o&#7693;ar Mal might take him by the hand and bring him to wait
on him. In consequence, the Raja&rsquo;s (&#7788;o&#7693;ar
Mal&rsquo;s) son had been appointed to bring him. Lakhm&#299; Chand now
similarly asked that the son of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah might bring
him to pay his respects. I sent S&#863;h&#257;p&#363;r<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5035src" href="#xd24e5035" name=
"xd24e5035src">18</a> to bring him to wait on me. He laid before me
rare things from his own hill country, such as <i>g&#363;n&#7789;h</i>
ponies, and birds of prey, such as hawks, <i>jurra</i> (falcons), royal
falcons, <i>qat&#804;&#257;s</i> (yaks), navels of musk, and skins of
the musk antelope with the musk-bags on them, swords which in their
language they call <i>kh&#257;n&#7693;&#257;</i>, and daggers which
they call <i>ka&#7789;&#257;r</i>, and all kinds of things. Amongst the
Rajas of this hill country this Raja is well known for the large
quantities of gold he has. They say there is a gold-mine in his
territory.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5054src" href="#xd24e5054" name=

<p class="par">In order to lay the foundation of a palace at Lahore, I
sent there K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n K&#863;hw&#257;ja D&#363;st
Muh&#803;ammad, who is well skilled in this kind of business.</p>
<p class="par">As the affairs of the Deccan, in consequence of the
disagreements among the Sardars and the carelessness of K&#863;h&#257;n
A&#703;z&#804;am, did not look well, and the defeat of &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n had taken place, I had sent for K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan to make enquiries into the real state of these
quarrels. After much enquiry and investigation it became clear that the
defeat of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n had been caused by his pride
and his sharp temper, and not listening to words (of advice) and partly
by the quarrels and want of agreement between the Amirs. Briefly, it
had been determined that &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n should start
from the direction of N&#257;sik and Trimbak with the Gujarat army and
the Amirs who had been appointed to accompany him. This army had been
brought into proper order by trustworthy leaders and zealous Amirs,
such as R&#257;ja R&#257;m D&#257;s, K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;lam, Saif
K&#863;h&#257;n, &#703;Al&#299; Mard&#257;n Bah&#257;dur, Z&#804;afar
K&#863;h&#257;n, and other servants of the State. The number of the
army had passed 10,000 and come up to near 14,000. On the side of Berar
it was settled that R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh, K&#863;h&#257;n
Jah&#257;n, the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257;, and many other leaders should
proceed. These two armies should be aware of each other&rsquo;s marches
and halts, so that on an appointed day they might catch the enemy
between the two. If this rule had been observed and their hearts had
been in unison, and self-interest had not come between, it is most
probable that Almighty God would have given them the victory of the
day. When &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n passed the Ghats and entered
the enemy&rsquo;s country, he did not take care to send runners
(<i>q&#257;&#7779;id&#257;n</i>) to bring intelligence from the other
army, nor did he, in accordance with the arrangements, make his
movements harmonise with theirs, so that on an appointed day they might
take the enemy between two armies. Rather he relied on his own
strength, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb220" href="#v1pb220" name=
"v1pb220">220</a>]</span>and considered that if he could gain the
victory alone it would be better. This idea fixed itself in his mind,
and however much R&#257;m D&#257;s desired him to promise to go forward
with due deliberation, it was of no use. The enemy, who were observing
him closely, had sent a large number of leaders and Barg&#299;s
(Mahrattas) against him, and encounters took place with them every day.
They did not fail to throw rockets and different fireworks at night. At
last the enemy drew near, and yet he obtained no intelligence about the
other army, though he had approached Daulatabad, which was the place of
assembly of the Dakhanis. &#703;Ambar, the black-faced, had raised to
sovereignty a child who, in his opinion, bore relationship to the
family of Niz&#804;&#257;mu-l-mulk. In order that men might fully
accept his (the child&rsquo;s) sovereignty, he raised him up and took
him by the hand, and made himself the Peshwa and leader. He sent men
again and again (against &#703;Abdu-llah), and the number of the enemy
was continually increasing till at last they made an attack, and by
throwing rockets and other fireworks made matters hot for him.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5067src" href="#xd24e5067" name=
"xd24e5067src">20</a> At length the loyalists thought it best, as no
assistance had come to them from the other army and all the Dakhanis
had turned against them, to retreat at once and try some other
arrangement. All agreed, and with one consent started off before dawn.
The Dakhanis followed them to the boundaries of their own country, and
the two armies, meeting every day, did not fail in fighting. In these
days several of the ambitious and zealous young men were killed.
&#703;Al&#299; Mard&#257;n K&#863;h&#257;n Bah&#257;dur, behaving like
a brave man, carried away terrible wounds and fell into the hands of
the enemy, and showed his companions an example of fidelity to his salt
and of life-sacrifice. Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r Beg also displayed
manly actions, and a rocket struck him on <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb221" href="#v1pb221" name="v1pb221">221</a>]</span>the leg, and
two days afterwards he died. When they entered the country of R&#257;ja
Bharj&#363;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5072src" href="#xd24e5072"
name="xd24e5072src">21</a> who was one of those loyal to the throne,
that body (the enemy) turned back, and &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
proceeded towards Gujarat. The real truth is this, that if in going he
had drawn his rein (gone slowly) and allowed the other army to have
come up to him, the matter would have turned out according to the wish
of the chief men of the victorious State.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5076src" href="#xd24e5076" name="xd24e5076src">22</a> As soon as
the news of the retreat of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n reached the
leaders of the army that was advancing from Berar, not seeing any
advantage from further stay, they also retired, and joined the camp of
Parwiz at &#703;&#256;dil&#257;b&#257;d in the neighbourhood of
Burhanpur. When this intelligence reached me at Agra I was greatly
agitated, and proposed to go there myself and destroy root and branch
those servants who had become masters. The Amirs and other devoted ones
would in no way consent to this. K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan represented that as no one understood the
business of that region as the Khankhanan did I ought to send him, and
that he should again arrange matters that had fallen into disorder, and
according to the exigencies of the time should compose differences so
that affairs might return to their original condition. Other
well-wishers being consulted, all their opinions were at one in this,
that the Khankhanan must be sent and that K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan should accompany him. Agreeing with this
determination, those who had charge of the affairs of the Khankhanan
and his companions obtained leave to go on Sunday, the 17th
Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, in the 7th year. S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z
K&#863;h&#257;n, K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan,
Razz&#257;q-bird&#299; &#362;zbeg, and several others of his associates
paid their parting salutations on the same day. The Khankhanan was
promoted to the rank of 6,000 personal, S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z
K&#863;h&#257;n <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb222" href="#v1pb222"

D&#257;r&#257;b K&#863;h&#257;n increased by 500 personal and 300 horse
(altogether 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse), and to
Rah&#803;man-d&#257;d, his (the Khankhanan&rsquo;s) younger son, I also
gave a fitting mansab. I presented the Khankhanan with a grand dress of
honour, a jewelled dagger, a special elephant with <i>tal&#257;yir</i>
(accoutrements), and an Iraq horse. In the same way I bestowed on his
sons and companions dresses of honour and horses. In the same month
Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk came from Kabul with his sons, and had the good
fortune to kiss the threshold. S&#863;hy&#257;m Singh and R&#257;y
Mangat Bhadauriya, who belonged to the army of Bangash, according to
the request of Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, were promoted to higher
mansabs. S&#863;hy&#257;m Singh had 1,500 personal and was increased by
500, and R&#257;y Mangat was also raised to a higher rank.</p>
<p class="par">For a long time past news had come of the illness of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n; sometimes the disease was got under
and sometimes recurred, until he died at Burhanpur in the 63rd year of
his age. His understanding and capacity were very good. He was very
quick-witted. He also wrote poetry. He composed &ldquo;K&#863;husrau
and S&#863;h&#299;r&#299;n,&rdquo; dedicating it to me, and called it
the &ldquo;N&#363;r-n&#257;ma&rdquo; (the writing of light).<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5086src" href="#xd24e5086" name=
"xd24e5086src">23</a> He had been ennobled in the time of my revered
father and made Vizier. In the days when I was a prince he had several
times done foolish things, and most men, and indeed K&#863;husrau
himself, were of opinion that after my accession I would do unpleasant
things (with regard to him). In a manner contrary to what had entered
the minds of himself and others, I favoured him and promoted him to the
rank of 5,000 personal and horse, and after he had for some time been
Vizier with full authority, neglected no point in increasing favour
towards him. After his death I gave mansabs to his sons and bestowed
kindnesses on them. At last <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb223"
href="#v1pb223" name="v1pb223">223</a>]</span>it was clear that his
disposition and sincerity were not as they should be, and, considering
his own evil deeds, he had always been suspicious with regard to me.
They say he was aware of the conspiracy and disturbance that took place
on the Kabul expedition, and had given support to the wretches. Indeed,
I had no confidence that notwithstanding my favour and kindness to him
he was not disloyal and of perverse fortune.</p>
<p class="par">After a short space of time, on the 25th of the same
month of Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, the news of M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;&rsquo;s death arrived. The said M&#299;rz&#257;
was of the ruling family of Thatta (Tatta), of the tribe of
Tark&#863;h&#257;n&#299;. His father, M&#299;rz&#257; J&#257;n&#299;,
in the time of my revered father became loyal, and with the Khankhanan,
who had been appointed to his province, he had the good fortune to have
the honour of waiting on Akbar near Lahore. By the royal favour he was
given his own province, and, choosing himself to serve at Court, he
sent his men to the charge and administration of Thatta, and remained
in the service while he lived. At last he died at Burhanpur.
M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, his son, who was
at Thatta, in accordance with the firman of the late king obtained the
government of that country. Sa&#703;&#299;d K&#863;h&#257;n, who was at
Bhakar (Bukkur), received an order to console him and bring him to
Court. The aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n sent men to him to recommend
loyalty to him. At last, having brought him to Agra, he procured him
the honour of kissing the feet of my revered father. He was at Agra
when my father died and I ascended the throne. After I arrived at
Lahore for the pursuit of K&#863;husrau news came that the Amirs on the
borders of Khurasan had assembled together and proceeded against
Qandahar, and that S&#863;h&#257;h Beg, the governor of that place, was
shut up in the fort and looking out for assistance. Of necessity an
army was appointed for the relief of Qandahar under the leadership of
M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; and other Amirs and generals.
When this army reached the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb224" href=
"#v1pb224" name="v1pb224">224</a>]</span>neighbourhood of Qandahar, the
army of Khurasan, not seeing in themselves the power to await it,
returned. M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;, having entered
Qandahar, handed over the country and the fort to Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been appointed to the government of the place,
and S&#863;h&#257;h Beg went to his own jagir. M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; started for Lahore by way of Bhakar. Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n was only a short time at Qandahar before he died, and
that province was again in need of a leader and master. This time I
added Qandahar to Thatta and handed it over to M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;. From that time till his death he remained there
continuously in performance of the duties of its protection and
government. His conduct towards the disaffected was excellent. As it
was necessary to send a leader to Qandahar in the place of
M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;, I appointed Ab&#363;-l-b&#299;
&#362;zbeg,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5096src" href="#xd24e5096" name=
"xd24e5096src">24</a> who was at Multan and in that neighbourhood, to
that post. I promoted him in rank from 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse
to 3,000 personal and horse, and honoured him with the title of
Bah&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n and a standard. The governorship of Delhi
and the protection and administration of that province was conferred on
Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n. I dignified R&#363;p
K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779;, who was one of the personal servants of
my revered father, with the title of K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779;
K&#863;h&#257;n, and, giving him the rank of 1,000 personal and 500
horse, bestowed on him the faujd&#257;rship of the Sarkar of Qanuj. As
I had sought the daughter<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5102src" href=
"#xd24e5102" name="xd24e5102src">25</a> of I&#703;tiq&#257;d
K&#863;h&#257;n, son of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, in marriage for
K&#863;hurram, and the marriage <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb225"

arranged for, I went on Thursday, 18th K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d, to his
house, and stayed there one day and one night. He (K&#863;hurram)
presented offerings (to me) and he gave jewels<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5112src" href="#xd24e5112" name="xd24e5112src">26</a> to the
Begams, and to his mothers (including stepmothers) and to the female
servants of the harem, and dresses of honour to the Amirs.</p>
<p class="par">I sent &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q, the bakhshi of the
palace (<i>dark&#863;h&#257;na</i>), to settle the country of Thatta
(Sind) until a Sardar should be appointed who could conciliate the
soldiery and the cultivators, and so bring the province into order. I
increased his rank and presented him with an elephant and a shawl
(<i>parmnarm</i>), and sent him off. I made Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk bakhshi
in his room. K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, who had been sent to inspect
the buildings in Lahore and to arrange about them, came in the end of
this month and waited on me. M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;&#298;s&#257;
Tark&#863;h&#257;n, one of the relations of M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;, had been appointed to the army of the Deccan. I
sent for him to arrange about the business of Thatta, and on the same
day he had the good fortune to pay his respects. As he was deserving of
favour, he was given the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. The
disease <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb226" href="#v1pb226" name=

physicians on Wednesday, the (date not given) of the said month, I drew
about a sir (<i>&#257;s&#804;&#257;r</i>)<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5156src" href="#xd24e5156" name="xd24e5156src">28</a> of blood
from my left arm. As great lightness resulted, it occurred to me that
if they were to call blood-letting &lsquo;lightening&rsquo; it would be
well. Nowadays this expression is made use of. To Muqarrab
K&#863;h&#257;n, who had bled me, I gave a jewelled <i>khapwa</i>
(dagger). Kis&#863;han D&#257;s, accountant of the elephant department
and stable, who from the time of the late king until now has been the
clerk in charge of two departments, and for ages had been hopeful of
the title of Raja and the rank of 1,000 personal, and before this had
been gratified with a title, now had the rank of 1,000 conferred on
him. M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam, son of Sult&#257;n H&#803;usain
M&#299;rz&#257; &#7778;afaw&#299;, who had been appointed to the army
of the Deccan, I sent for at his request. On Saturday, the 9th of the
month of T&#299;r, he came with his sons and waited on me. He made an
offering of a ruby and forty-six royal pearls. I increased the rank of
T&#257;j K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of Bhakar, who was one of the
old Amirs of this State, by 500 personal and horse.</p>
<p class="par">The tale of the death of S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n is a very strange affair. After he had performed such
services and Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n had given him leave to go to
the Sarkar of Orissa, one night on the road he was riding on a female
elephant <i>chaukand&#299;-d&#257;r</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5168src" href="#xd24e5168" name="xd24e5168src">29</a> (? in a
square howdah or four-pillared canopy), and had given a young eunuch a
place behind him<span class="corr" id="xd24e5174" title=
"Source: ,">.</span> When he left his camp they had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb227" href="#v1pb227" name=
"v1pb227">227</a>]</span>fastened up an elephant that was in heat on
the road. From the noise of the horses&rsquo; hoofs and the movement of
the horsemen he attempted to break his chain. On this account a great
noise and confusion took place. When this noise reached the ear of the
eunuch, he in a state of bewilderment awoke S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was asleep or in the insensibility of wine, and
said: &ldquo;An elephant in heat has got loose and is coming in this
direction.&rdquo; As soon as he heard this he became confused and threw
himself down from the front of the chaukandi. When he threw himself off
his toe struck against a stone and was torn open, and he died in two or
three days of that same wound. In short, from hearing this affair I was
completely bewildered. That a brave man on the mere hearing of a cry or
a word coming from a child should become so confused and throw himself
down without control from the top of an elephant is in truth a matter
of amazement. The news of this event reached me on the 19th of the
month of T&#299;r. I consoled his sons with kindnesses and the
conferring of offices. If this accident had not happened to him, as he
had done notable service, he would have obtained exaltation with
greater favours and kindnesses.</p>

asked for leave to depart. As in the time of my father there had been
given to his father 100 horses, I gave him the same number as well as
an elephant, and while he was at Court bestowed on him dresses of
honour and a jewelled dagger. Also to his brothers I gave dresses of
honour and horses. I presented him with his territory according to
previous arrangements, and he went back to his home happy and

the same day and waited on me. As a Sardar was needed to be sent for
the governorship of Patna and the rule of that place, it occurred to me
to send M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam. Having raised his rank from 5,000
personal and 1,500 horse to 5,000 personal and horse, on the 26th
Jum&#257;d&#257;-s&#804;-s&#804;&#257;n&#299;, corresponding to the 2nd
S&#863;hahr&#299;war, I gave him the government of Patna, and bestowing
on him a special elephant, a horse with a jewelled saddle, a jewelled
sword, and a superb dress of honour, I dismissed him. His sons and the
sons of his brother Muzaffar H&#803;usain K&#863;h&#257;n
M&#299;rz&#257;&#702;&#299; were exalted with increased rank,
elephants, horses, and dresses of honour, and sent off with him. I
appointed R&#257;y Dul&#299;p to support M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam. As his
residence was near that place, he collected a good body of men for that
service. I increased his rank by 500 personal and horse, so that it
became 2,000 with 1,000 horse, and also gave him an elephant.
Ab&#363;-l-fath&#803; Dakhan&#299; had obtained a jagir in the Sarkar
of Nagpur and that neighbourhood. He was dismissed in order that he
might administer his jagir and look to the guarding and government of
that country as well. K&#863;husrau B&#299; &#362;zbeg was appointed to
the faujd&#257;rship of the Sarkar of Mewar. His rank of 800 personal
and 300 horse was now increased to 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and I
also presented him with a horse. As I had my eye on the old service of
Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n, it occurred to me that I must not pass by the
desire of his heart. I had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb230" href=

<p class="par">On Thursday, the 22nd S&#863;hahr&#299;war,
corresponding with 17th Rajab, 1021, the feast of my solar weighing
took place in the house of Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;. It is an approved
custom with me to weigh myself in this manner. The late king Akbar, who
was the place of manifestation of kindness and grace, also approved of
the custom, and twice in every year weighed himself against several
sorts of metals, gold, silver, and many precious articles, once
according to the solar and once according to the lunar year, and
divided their total value, which was worth about a lakh of rupees,
among faqirs and needy people. I also observe this annual custom and
weigh myself in the same manner, and give those valuables to faqirs.

Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, leader of the army of Bangas&#863;h
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb231" href="#v1pb231" name=

Subah who had been sent as companions to him under his leadership,
there were quarrels, especially with K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n, I
sent K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n to make enquiry as to which side was
in fault. On the 11th of the month of Mihr, Mu&#703;taqid
K&#863;h&#257;n was appointed to the high dignity of bakhshi, and his
mansab was raised to 1,000 personal and 300 horse. Raising for the
second time the mansabs of Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n a little, I made it
2,500 personal and 1,500 horse by an increase of 500. On the
representation of the Khankhanan, Far&#299;d&#363;n K&#863;h&#257;n
Barl&#257;s was raised to the mansab, original and increase, of 2,500
personal and 2,000 horse. R&#257;y Manohar received that of 1,000
personal and 800 horse, and R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo that of 4,000
personal and 2,200 horse. Bh&#257;rat, grandson of R&#257;mchand
Band&#299;lah, I, after the latter&rsquo;s death, honoured with the
title of Raja. On the 28th &#256;b&#257;n, Zafar K&#863;h&#257;n,
having come according to summons from the Subah of Gujarat, waited on
me. He brought as offerings a ruby and three pearls. On the 6th
&#256;z&#817;ar, corresponding with the 3rd S&#863;haww&#257;l, news
came from Burhanpur that the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; had died on
Sunday, the 27th &#256;b&#257;n, in the parganah of Nih&#257;lp&#363;r.
After the illness he had at Lahore his intelligence appeared to be
less, and a great loss of memory happened to him. He was very sincere.
It is sad that he left no son capable of patronage and favour.
Ch&#299;n Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n came from his father, who was at
Peshawar, on the 20th &#256;z&#817;ar, and offered (on his
father&rsquo;s behalf) 100 muhrs and 100 rupees, and also presented the
offerings he had of his own in the shape of a horse and cloth stuffs
and other things. To the government of Behar I promoted Zafar
K&#863;h&#257;n, who is one of the trustworthy house-born ones and
foster-children, and increasing his mansab by 500 personal and horse, I
made it up to 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, and also honouring his
brothers with robes of honour and horses, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

go off to that province. He had always hoped that he might obtain some
separate service in order that he might show his natural ability. I
also desired to prove him and make this service the touchstone by which
to try him. As it was the season for travelling and hunting, on
Tuesday, the 2nd Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da (25th December, 1612),
corresponding with the 4th Day, I left Agra with the intention of
hunting and encamped in the Dahrah garden, remaining there four
days.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5260src" href="#xd24e5260" name=
"xd24e5260src">35</a> On the 10th of the same month the news came of
the death of Sal&#299;ma Sult&#804;&#257;n Begam, who had been ill in
the city. Her mother was Gul-ruk&#863;h Begam, daughter of King
B&#257;bar, and her father M&#299;rz&#257; N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n
Muh&#803;ammad, of the Naqs&#863;hband&#299; K&#863;hw&#257;jas. She
was adorned with all good qualities. In women this degree of skill and
capacity is seldom found. H.M. Hum&#257;y&#363;n, by way of kindness
(to Bair&#257;m), had betrothed her who was his sister&rsquo;s daughter
to Bair&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n. After his death, in the beginning of
the reign of the late king Akbar, the marriage took place. After the
said <span class="corr" id="xd24e5269" title=
"Source: Khan">K&#863;h&#257;n</span> had been killed, my revered
father married her himself. She received mercy (died) in the 60th year
of her age.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5273src" href="#xd24e5273" name=
"xd24e5273src">36</a> On the same day I marched from the Dahrah garden
and sent I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah to bury her (lit. lift her up),
and ordered him to place her in the building in the Mand&#257;kar
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb233" href="#v1pb233" name=

of the month of Day, M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Al&#299; Beg
Akbars&#863;h&#257;h&#299; came from the army of the Deccan and waited
on me. K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, whom I had despatched to the Subah
of Kabul, returned on the 21st of the same month and waited on me. The
time for his going and coming had extended to three months and eleven
days. He brought twelve muhrs and twelve rupees as an offering. On the
same day R&#257;ja R&#257;m D&#257;s also came from the victorious army
of the Deccan and paid his respects, and made an offering of 101 muhrs.
As robes of honour for the winter season had not been sent to the Amirs
of the Deccan, they were forwarded by the hand of H&#803;ay&#257;t
K&#863;h&#257;n. As the port of Surat had been assigned in jagir to
Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, he prayed that Ch&#299;n Qil&#299;j (his
son) might be despatched for its guardianship and administration. On
the 27th Day he had a dress of honour, and being honoured with a dress
of honour and the title of K&#863;h&#257;n, and a standard, obtained
leave to go. For the purpose of advising the Amirs of Kabul, and on
account of the disagreements that had sprung up between them and
Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, I sent R&#257;ja R&#257;m D&#257;s, and
bestowed on him a horse and robe of honour and 30,000 rupees for
expenses. On the 6th Bahman, when my camp was in the parganah of
B&#257;r&#299;, there came the news of the death of
K&#863;hw&#257;jag&#299; Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain, who was of the
ancient servants of this State. His elder brother, Muh&#803;ammad
Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n, in the time of my revered father, found
great favour, and K&#863;hw&#257;ja Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain as well
was one of his confidential servants, and held employments such as that
of superintendent of the kitchen (<i>bak&#257;wul</i>) and such like.
He left no son and was beardless, and not a single hair of moustache or
whiskers appeared on him. At the time of speaking he spoke very
shrilly, and was looked upon as an eunuch. S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z
K&#863;h&#257;n, whom the Khankhanan had sent from Burhanpur to make
certain representations, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb234" href=
"#v1pb234" name="v1pb234">234</a>]</span>came on the 15th of the same
month and waited on me. He presented 100 muhrs and 100 rupees. As the
affairs of the Deccan, in consequence of the hasty proceedings of
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n and the treachery of the Amirs, did not
present a good prospect, the Dakhanis obtained an opportunity for
speaking and began to talk of peace to the Amirs and well-wishers
there. &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n embraced the robe of loyalty,
and prayed that if the affairs of the Deccan were entrusted to him he
would so arrange that some of the districts which had been taken out of
the possession of the officers of the State should be restored. The
loyal ones, looking to the necessities of the time, represented this,
and a settlement of some kind was arrived at, and the Khankhanan
undertook to settle matters. The K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am was
also desirous of putting down the rebel R&#257;n&#257;, and begged for
this service by way of obtaining merit (as a
<i>g&#863;h&#257;z&#299;</i>). He was ordered to go to Malwa, which was
his jagir, and after arranging matters there to take up this duty. The
mansab of Ab&#363;-l-b&#299; Uzbeg<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5295src"
href="#xd24e5295" name="xd24e5295src">37</a> was increased by 1,000
personal and 500 horse to 4,000 personal and 3,500 horse. My hunting
went on for 2 months and 20 days, and during that time I went out every
day to hunt. As not more than 50 or 60 days remained before the
world-illumining New Year, I returned, and on the 24th Isfandiy&#257;r
encamped in the Dahrah garden. The courtiers and some of the
mansabdars, who by order had remained in the city, came on that day and
waited on me. Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n presented a decorated jar, Frank
hats, and a jewelled sparrow (?). I remained three days in the garden,
and on the 27th Isfandiy&#257;r entered the city. During this
time<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5302src" href="#xd24e5302" name=
"xd24e5302src">38</a> 223 head of deer, etc., 95 nilgaw, 2 boars, 36

Blochmann, p. 520, on the authority of the
Mak&#863;hzan-i-Afg&#863;h&#257;n&#299;, says the fight took place 100
kos from Dacca and in a place called Nek Ujy&#257;l, and he points out
in a note that there are several Ujy&#257;ls in Eastern Bengal.
Possibly Adh&#257;r is Udh&#257;r or Uz&#257;r, and a corruption of
Ujy&#257;l. The &lsquo;hills of Dacca,&rsquo; referred to by Blochmann,
might be Ran Bhawal or the Madh&#363;p&#363;r jungle. The
Riy&#257;z&#803;u-s-sal&#257;t&#804;&#299;n does not mention the site
of the battle, and the translator, Maulaw&#299;
&#703;Abdu-s-Sal&#257;m, has in his note at p. 175 confounded two
&#703;&#298;s&#257; K&#863;h&#257;ns, and so drawn groundless
inferences. Blochmann points out, p. 520, that the
Ma&#702;&#257;s&#804;iru-l-umar&#257; says the prisoners were
afterwards put to death. The passage is at vol. ii, p. 632. It says
they were put to death by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s orders by
&#703;Abdu-llah (who certainly was brute enough for anything).
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, T&#363;zuk, p. 112, mentions the arrival of
&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n&rsquo;s sons and brothers at Court, so that
Blochmann&rsquo;s statement at p. 520 about their being executed on the
road is not correct. It appears, too, they came to Court after
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at&rsquo;s death. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r says
(T&#363;zuk, p. 112) he made over the prisoners to responsible servants
of government. &#703;Abdu-llah may have been one of these, and have got
rid of his prisoners by killing them. It would appear that the battle
with &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n took place to the east or south-east of
Dacca, and not near Orissa, as Stewart supposed.&nbsp;<a class=

missed out two lines in his quotation. An Indian lithograph has

the latter reading occurs in Brockhaus. In the fourth line

<i>T&#299;rkas&#863;h-i-Jauz&#257;</i> means both a particular
constellation in the sign Gemini, which is supposed to resemble a
quiver in appearance, and also the strings of a musical instrument. The
meaning of the lines seems to be, &ldquo;I have been wounded by the
shaft of heaven: give me wine that I may become intoxicated and be able
to tie a knot in the quiver-girdle of the Gemini.&rdquo; The
appositeness of the <i>f&#257;l</i> is not very apparent, but the

N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s brother, the &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n IV and Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan of Beale, who also had
the names of I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n and
Yam&#299;nu-d-daulah. There is an account of the betrothal and wedding
in the P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h-n&#257;ma, i, 388. It seems that the
betrothal took place five years and three months before the marriage,
and when S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n was 15 years old. At the time of
the marriage S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n was 20 years and 3 months old
and Arjumand B&#257;n&#363; was 19 years and 1 month. 18th
K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d, 1021, would correspond to about the end of
May, 1612, but the P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h-n&#257;ma gives the eve of
Friday, 9th Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal of 1021, corresponding to 22nd
Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, as the day of the marriage. This would
correspond to 30th April, 1612, so that apparently
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s visit to the house (apparently
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah&rsquo;s, but possibly S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s) took place about a month after the marriage.
Arjumand B&#257;n&#363; died in childbed at Burhanpur in 1040, or July,
1631, the chronogram being one word, viz. <i>g&#863;ham</i>,
&lsquo;grief.&rsquo; She must have been born in 1591, and was in her
40th year when she died. She was not S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s
first wife, for he was married to the daughter of Muz&#804;affar
H&#803;usain &#7778;afaw&#299;, a descendant of S&#863;h&#257;h
Isma&#703;&#299;l of Persia, in September, 1610 (Rajab, 1019), but the
betrothal to Arjumand was earlier than this. It was in Arjumand&rsquo;s
honour that the T&#257;j was built.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

&#703;Al&#299; Ah&#803;mad died suddenly two years before this, unless
indeed the passage at p. 169 refers to the mimic and not to
&#703;Al&#299; Ah&#803;mad. Probably the meaning is that &#703;Al&#299;
Ah&#803;mad had made this couplet on some previous occasion, and that
one of the courtiers now quoted it. His verse about the hundred murders
may contain a play on the word <i>k&#863;h&#363;n</i>,
&lsquo;blood,&rsquo; and refer to the spilling of the blood-like wine.
It is difficult to understand how Jah&#257;ng&#299;r came to introduce
the verse into his Memoirs here. It does not seem to have any
connection with the account of the Raja of Kumaon. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
says it was quoted &lsquo;incidentally,&rsquo; <i>b&#257;
taqarrub&#299;</i>. Perhaps the word here means &lsquo;by way of
parody,&rsquo; or &lsquo;by way of paraphrase.&rsquo; In the MS. used
by Erskine the words of the first line seem to be <i>Maguz&#817;ar
Mas&#299;h&#803; bar sar-i-m&#257;</i>, and so Erskine translates
&ldquo;Pass not, O Messiah, over the heads of us victims of

<h2 class="main">The Eighth New Year after the auspicious
Accession.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The eighth year after my accession, corresponding
with Muh&#803;arram, 1022. On the night of Thursday, the 27th
Muh&#803;arram, corresponding with the 1st Farward&#299;n in the eighth
year after my accession, after 3&frac12; gharis of day had elapsed, his
honour the sun passed from the constellation of Pisces to that of
Aries, which is his abode of rejoicing and victory. Early in the
morning of the New Year&rsquo;s Day the feast was prepared and adorned
after the custom of every year. At the end of that day I sat on the
throne of State, and the Amirs and ministers of the State and the
courtiers of the palace came to salute and congratulate me. On these
days of happy augury I sat the whole day in the public audience hall.
Those who had anything to ask or claim presented their petitions, and
the offerings of the servants of the palace were laid before me.
Ab&#363;-l-b&#299;, governor of Qandahar, had sent for an offering Iraq
horses and hunting dogs, and they were brought before me. On the 9th of
the same month Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n came from the Subah of
Behar, and in waiting on me presented 100 muhrs and 100 rupees, as well
as an elephant. On the 12th the offering of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah
was laid before me, consisting of jewels, cloths, and other things.
That which pleased me attained to the dignity of acceptance. Of the
elephants of Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s offering ten others
were inspected on this day. On the 13th the offerings of Tarbiyat
K&#863;h&#257;n were laid before me. Mu&#703;taqid K&#863;h&#257;n
bought a house at Agra, and passed some days in that place. Misfortunes
happened to him one after another. We have heard that prosperity and
bad luck depend on four things: first, upon your wife; second, upon
your slave; third upon your house; fourth, upon your horse. In order to
know the prosperity or ill-luck of a house a rule has been established,
indeed they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb236" href="#v1pb236"
name="v1pb236">236</a>]</span>say it is infallible. One must clear a
small piece of the site from earth, and again strew the earth upon the
same ground. If it cover it, one may call it middling good fortune for
that house, neither prosperity nor misfortune; if it become less (i.e.
does not cover it exactly) it points to ill-luck, and if it does more
(than cover it) it is fortunate and auspicious. On the 14th the mansab
of I&#703;tib&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n was raised from 1,000 and 300
horse to 2,000 personal and 500 horse. I increased the mansab of
Tarbiyat K&#863;h&#257;n by 500 personal and 50 horse, so that it
became 2,000 personal and 850 horse. H&#363;s&#863;hang, son of
Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n, who was in Bengal with his father, came at
this time and paid his respects. He brought with him some Maghs, whose
country is near Pegu and Arracan, and the country is still in their
possession. I made some enquiries as to their customs and religion.
Briefly they are animals in the form of men. They eat everything there
is either on land or in the sea, and nothing is forbidden by their
religion. They eat with anyone. They take into their possession (marry)
their sisters by another mother. In face they are like the Qar&#257;
Qalm&#257;qs, but their language is that of Tibet and quite unlike
Turk&#299;. There is a range of mountains, one end of which touches the
province of K&#257;s&#863;hg&#863;har and the other the country of
Pegu. They have no proper religion or any customs that can be
interpreted as religion. They are far from the Musulman faith and
separated from that of the Hindus.</p>
<p class="par">Two or three days before the S&#863;haraf (the
sun&rsquo;s highest point) my son K&#863;hurram desired me to go to his
house that he might present his New Year&rsquo;s offerings from that
place. I agreed to his request, and remained for one day and one night
at his house. He presented his offerings. I took what I approved of and
gave him back the rest. The next day Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n
presented his offerings. Every day until the day of culmination
(<i>r&#363;z-i-s&#863;haraf</i>) the offerings of one or of two or
three of the Amirs were laid before me. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb237" href="#v1pb237" name="v1pb237">237</a>]</span>On Monday, the
19th Farward&#299;n, the assembly of the S&#863;haraf was held. On that
auspicious day I sat on the throne of State, and an order was given
that they should produce all sorts of intoxicating things, such as
wine, etc., so that every one according to his desire might take what
he liked. Many took wine. The offerings of Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n
were on this day brought to me. I gave one gold muhr of 1,000 tolas,
which is called the star of destiny
(<i>kaukab-i-t&#804;&#257;li&#703;</i>), to Y&#257;dg&#257;r
&#703;Al&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, the ambassador of the ruler of Iran.
The feast went off well. After the assembly broke up I ordered that
they might carry off the furniture and decorations. The offering of the
Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n had not been arranged on New Year&rsquo;s Day.
All sorts of rareties and excellent presents were now produced which he
had collected together. Amongst others, twelve Iraq and Arab horses
that had been brought in a ship, and jewelled saddles of Frank
workmanship<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5324src" href="#xd24e5324" name=
"xd24e5324src">1</a> were produced before me. To the mansab of
Naw&#257;zis&#863;h K&#863;h&#257;n 500 horse were added so as to make
it one of 2,000 personal and horse. An elephant called Bans&#299;badan,
which Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n had sent from Bengal, was brought to
me and put among my special elephants. On the 3rd
Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, K&#863;hw&#257;ja Y&#257;dg&#257;r, brother of
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, came from Gujarat and waited on me; he
offered 100 Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; muhrs. After he had been in
attendance a few days he was honoured with the title of Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n. As a competent bakhshi had to be sent to the army of
Bangas&#863;h and those regions, I chose Mu&#703;taqid K&#863;h&#257;n
for this duty, and increased his mansab by 300 personal and 50 horse so
that it became 1,500 with 350 horse, and dismissed him. It was settled
that he must go quickly. I sent off Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain
Cheleb&#299;, who understood the purchase of jewels and collecting
curiosities, with money to go by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb238"
href="#v1pb238" name="v1pb238">238</a>]</span>way of Iraq to
Constantinople and buy and bring for the Sarkar curiosities and
rareties. For this purpose it was necessary that he should pay his
respects to the ruler of Iran. I had given him a letter and a
memorandum (of what he was to procure). Briefly, he saw my brother,
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s, in Mashhad, and the king enquired
from him what kind of things should be brought for his master&rsquo;s
Sarkar. As he was urgent, Cheleb&#299; showed the list he had brought
with him. In that list there were entered good turquoise and
<i>m&#363;m&#299;y&#257;</i> (bitumen) from the mine of Ispahan. He
told him that these two articles were not to be bought, but he would
send them for me. He authorized Uwais&#299; T&#363;pch&#299; (gunner),
who was one of his private servants, to hand over to him six bags
(<i>amb&#257;ncha</i>) of turquoise earth holding about 30 seers, with
14 tolas of mumiya and four Iraq horses, one of which was a piebald,
and he wrote a letter containing many, many expressions of friendship.
With regard to the inferior quality of the turquoise dust
(<i>k&#863;h&#257;ka</i>) and the small quantity of mumiya he made many
apologies. The khaka appeared very inferior. Although the jewellers and
makers of rings made every endeavour, no stone that was fit to be made
into a finger ring could be produced. Probably in these days turquoise
dust is not procurable from the mines such as it was in the time of the
late king T&#804;ahm&#257;sp. He mentioned all this in the letter. With
regard to the effect of mumiya I had heard much from scientists, but
when I tried it no result was apparent. I do not know whether
physicians have exaggerated its effect, or whether its efficacy had
been lessened by its being stale. At any rate, I gave it to a fowl with
a broken leg to drink in larger quantity than they said and in the
manner laid down by the physicians, and rubbed some on the place where
it was broken, and kept it there for three days, though it was said to
be sufficient to keep it from morning till evening. But after I had
examined it, no effect was produced, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb239" href="#v1pb239" name="v1pb239">239</a>]</span>the broken
place remained as it was.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5349src" href=
"#xd24e5349" name="xd24e5349src">2</a> In a separate letter the Shah
had written a recommendation of Sal&#257;mu-llah, the Arab. I
immediately increased his mansab and his jagir.</p>
<p class="par">I sent one of my private elephants with trappings to
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n and gave another to Qil&#299;j
K&#863;h&#257;n. I ordered that assignments
(<i>tank&#863;hw&#257;h</i>) should be made to 12,000 horse on the
establishment<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5366src" href="#xd24e5366"
name="xd24e5366src">3</a> of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n at the
rate of three horses and two horses for each trooper. As previously
with a view to service in Junagarh I had increased the mansab of his
brother Sard&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n by 500 personal and 300 horse, and
had afterwards assigned the duty to K&#257;mil K&#863;h&#257;n, I
ordered that he should retain his increase and that it should be
counted (permanently) in his mansab. I increased the rank of
Sarfar&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n, which was that of 1,500 personal and 500
horse, by 200 horse more. On the 27th Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht,
corresponding with the 26th Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal, in the eighth
year of my reign, in the year 1022 of the Hijra era, on Thursday, the
meeting for my lunar weighing took place in the house of
Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299; (his mother). Some of the money that was
weighed I ordered to be given to the women and the deserving ones who
had assembled in my mother&rsquo;s house. On the same day I increased
by 1,000 the mansab of Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, so that it
came to 6,000 personal and 5,000 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb240"

a slave of M&#299;rz&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, came from Patna in the
company of &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299; and waited
on me, and Sard&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, brother of &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n, obtained leave to go to Ahmadabad. An Afghan had
brought from the Carnatic two goats that had <i>p&#257;zahar</i>
(bezoar stones, an antidote against poison). I had always heard that an
animal that has pazahar is very thin and miserable, but these goats
were very fat and fresh. I ordered them to kill one of them, which was
a female. Four pazahar stones became apparent, and this caused great
astonishment.</p>
<p class="par">It is an established fact that cheetahs in unaccustomed
places do not pair off with a female, for my revered father once
collected together 1,000 cheetahs. He was very desirous that they
should pair, but this in no way came off. He had many times coupled
male and female cheetahs together in gardens, but there, too, it did
not come off. At this time a male cheetah, having slipped its collar,
went to a female and paired with it, and after two and a half months
three young ones were born and grew up. This has been recorded because
it appeared strange. As cheetahs did not pair with cheetahs, (still
less) had it ever been heard in former times(?) that tigers mated in
captivity. As in the time of my reign wild beasts have abandoned their
savagery, tigers have become so tame that troops of them without chains
or restraint go about amongst the people, and they neither harm men nor
have any wildness or alarm. It happened that a tigress became pregnant
and after three months bore three cubs; it had never happened that a
wild tiger after its capture had paired. It had been heard from
philosophers that the milk of a tigress was of great use for
brightening eyes. Although we made every effort that the moisture of
milk should appear in her breasts, we could not accomplish it. It
occurs to me that as it is a raging creature, and milk appears in the
breasts of mothers by reason of the affection they have for their

their breasts in connection with their young ones drinking and sucking
at the time of their taking (the milk), their (the mothers&rsquo;) rage
increases and the milk in their breasts is dried up.</p>
<p class="par">At the end of Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Q&#257;sim, brother of K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z,
who is of the Naqs&#863;hband&#299; K&#863;hw&#257;jas, came from
M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr and waited on me. After a few days
12,000 rupees were given to him as a present. As K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Jah&#257;n had made a melon-bed in the neighbourhood of the city, when
two watches of day had passed on Thursday, the 10th
K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d, I got into a boat and went to inspect the
melon-bed, and took the ladies with me. We reached there when two or
three gharis of day were left, and passed the evening in walking among
the beds. A wonderfully sharp wind and whirlwind sprang up, so that the
tents and screens fell down. I got into the boat and passed the night
in it. I also passed part of the Friday in walking about the melon-bed,
and returned to the city. Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n, who for a long
time had been afflicted with boils and other sores, died on the 10th
K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d. I transferred the jagir and hereditary land of
R&#257;ja Jagman, who had failed in his service in the Deccan, to
Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n. S&#863;haik&#863;h P&#299;r, who is one
of the emancipated ones who hold aloof from the attachments of the age,
and who on account of the pure friendship that he bears towards me has
chosen to be my companion and servant, had before this founded a mosque
in the parganah of Mairtha, which is his native place. At this time he
took occasion to mention the circumstance. As I found his mind bent on
the completion of this building I gave him 4,000 rupees, so that he
himself might go and expend it, and also gave him a valuable
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb242" href="#v1pb242" name=
"v1pb242">242</a>]</span>shawl and dismissed him. In the public
audience hall there were two railings (<i>mah&#803;jar</i>) of wood.
Inside the first, Amirs, ambassadors, and people of honour sat, and no
one entered this circle without an order. Within the second railing,
which is broader than the first, the mansabdars of inferior
rank,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5409src" href="#xd24e5409" name=
"xd24e5409src">5</a> ahadis, and those who had work to do are admitted.
Outside this railing stand the servants of the Amirs and all the people
who may enter the Diwankhana. As there was no difference between the
first and second railings, it occurred to me that I should decorate the
first with silver. I ordered this railing and the staircase that led
from this railing to the balcony of the Jharokha, as well as the two
elephants placed on the two sides of the seat of the Jharokha, which
skilful people had made of wood, to be decorated with silver. After
this was completed it was reported to me that 125 maunds of silver in
Hindustani weight, equal to 880 maunds of Persia, had been used up;
indeed, it now assumed a worthy appearance.</p>
<p class="par">On the 3rd of the month of T&#299;r, Muz&#804;affar
K&#863;h&#257;n came from Thatta<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5417src"
href="#xd24e5417" name="xd24e5417src">6</a> and waited on me. He made
an offering of twelve muhrs and a Koran with a jewelled cover, and two
jewelled roses(?) (<i>d&#363; gul</i>). On the 14th of the same month
&#7778;afdar K&#863;h&#257;n came from the Subah of Behar and waited on
me, offering 101 muhrs. After Muz&#804;affar K&#863;h&#257;n had been
some days in attendance, I increased his former mansab by 500 personal,
and giving him a standard and a private shawl dismissed him to
Thatta.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5423src" href="#xd24e5423" name=
"xd24e5423src">7</a></p>
<p class="par">I knew that every animal or living thing bitten by a mad
dog died, but this had not been ascertained in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb243" href="#v1pb243" name=
"v1pb243">243</a>]</span>the case of an elephant. In my time it so
happened that one night a mad dog came into the place where was tied
one of my private elephants, Gajpat&#299;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5430src" href="#xd24e5430" name="xd24e5430src">8</a> by name, and
bit the foot of a female elephant that was with mine. She at once cried
out. The elephant-keepers at once ran in, and the dog fled away into a
thorn-brake that is there. After a little while it came in again and
bit my private elephant&rsquo;s fore-foot as well. The elephant killed
it. When a month and five days had passed after this event, one day
when it was cloudy the growling of thunder came to the ear of the
female elephant, that was in the act of eating, and it of a sudden
raised a cry and its limbs began to tremble. It threw itself on the
ground, but rose again. For seven days water ran out of its mouth, then
suddenly it uttered a cry and showed distress. The remedies the drivers
gave it had no effect, and on the eighth day it fell and died. A month
after the death of the female elephant they took the large elephant to
the edge of the river in the plain. It was cloudy and thundery in the
same way. The said elephant in the height of excitement all at once
began to tremble and sat down on the ground. With a thousand
difficulties the drivers took it to its own place. After the same
interval and in the same way that had happened to the female elephant
this elephant also died. Great amazement was caused by this affair, and
in truth it is a matter to be wondered at that an animal of such size
and bulk should be so much affected by a little wound inflicted on it
by such a weak creature.</p>
<p class="par">As K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;nan had repeatedly
begged for leave to be given to his son S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z
K&#863;h&#257;n, on the 4th Amurd&#257;d I gave him a horse and a robe
of honour and dismissed him to the Deccan. I promoted Ya&#703;q&#363;b
Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;, whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb244" href="#v1pb244" name="v1pb244">244</a>]</span>mansab was 150,
to 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse, on account of the bravery he had
displayed, and gave him the title of K&#863;h&#257;n as well as a
standard.</p>
<p class="par">The Hindus are in four divisions, and each of these acts
according to its own rules and ways. In every year they keep a fixed
day. The first is the caste of the Brahmans,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5439src" href="#xd24e5439" name="xd24e5439src">9</a> that is
those who know the Incomparable God. Their duties are of six
kinds&mdash;(1) to acquire religious knowledge, (2) to give
instructions to others, (3) to worship fire, (4) to lead men to the
worship of fire, (5) giving something to the needy, (6) taking gifts.
There is for this caste an appointed day, and that is the last day of
the month of S&#257;wan, the second month of the rainy season.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5442src" href="#xd24e5442" name=
"xd24e5442src">10</a> They consider this an auspicious day, and the
worshippers go on that day to the banks of rivers and tanks, and recite
enchantments, breathe upon cords and coloured threads; on another day,
which is the first of the New Year, they fasten them on the hands of
the Rajas and great men of the time, and look on them as (good) omens.
They call this thread <i>r&#257;kh&#299;</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5448src" href="#xd24e5448" name="xd24e5448src">11</a> that is,
preservation (<i>nig&#257;h-d&#257;s&#863;ht</i>). This day occurs in
the month of T&#299;r, when the world-heating sun is in the
constellation of Cancer. The second caste is that of the Chhatr&#299;,
which is known as Khatr&#299;. Their duty is to protect the oppressed
from the evil of the oppressors. The customs of this caste are three
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb245" href="#v1pb245" name=
"v1pb245">245</a>]</span>things&mdash;(1) that they study religious
science themselves but do not teach others; (2) that they worship fire,
but do not teach others to do so; (3) that they give to the needy, but
although they are needy take nothing themselves. The day of this caste
is the <i>Bijay dasam&#299;n</i>, &lsquo;the victorious
tenth.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5466src" href="#xd24e5466"
name="xd24e5466src">12</a> On this day with them it is lucky to mount
and go against one&rsquo;s enemy with an army. R&#257;m Chand, whom
they worship as their god, leading his army on that day against his
enemy won a victory, and they consider this a great day, and,
decorating their elephants and horses, perform worship. This day falls
in the month of S&#863;hahr&#299;war,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5469src" href="#xd24e5469" name="xd24e5469src">13</a> when the
Sun is in the mansion of Virgo, and on it they give presents to those
who look after their horses and elephants. The third caste is that of
Bais&#863;h (Vais&#863;hya)<span class="corr" id="xd24e5478" title=
"Not in source">.</span> Its custom is this, that they serve the other
two castes of which mention has been made. They practise agriculture
and buying and selling, and are employed in the business of profit and
interest. This caste has also a fixed day which they call the
Dew&#257;l&#299;; this day occurs in the month of Mihr when the sun is
in the constellation of Libra, the 28th day of the lunar month. On the
night of that day they light lamps, and friends and those who are dear
assemble in each other&rsquo;s houses and pass their time busily in
gambling. As the eyes of this caste are on profit and interest, they
consider carrying over and opening new accounts on that day auspicious.
The fourth caste is the Sudras, who are the lowest caste of the Hindus.
They are the servants of all, and derive no profit from those things
which are the specialities of every (other) caste. Thursday is the
Hol&#299;, which in their belief is the last day of the year. This day
occurs in the month of Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;, when the sun is in the
constellation of Pisces. On the night of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb246" href="#v1pb246" name="v1pb246">246</a>]</span>this day they
light fires at the head of the streets and ways, and when it becomes
day they for one watch scatter the ashes on each other&rsquo;s heads
and faces, and make a wonderful noise and disturbance, and after this
wash themselves, put on their apparel, and walk about in the gardens
and on the plains. As it is an established custom of the Hindus to burn
the dead, to light fires on this night, which is the last night of the
year that has passed, signifies that they burn the last year, which has
gone to the abode of the dead. In the time of my revered father the
Hindu Amirs and others in imitation of them performed the ceremony of
rakhi in adorning him, making strings of rubies and royal pearls and
flowers jewelled with gems of great value and binding them on his
auspicious arms. This custom was carried on for some years. As they
carried this extravagance to excess, and he disliked it, he forbade it.
The brahmans by way of auguries used to tie these strings and (pieces
of) silk according to their custom. I also in this year carried out
this laudable religious practice, and ordered that the Hindu Amirs and
the heads of the caste<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5484src" href=
"#xd24e5484" name="xd24e5484src">14</a> should fasten rakhis on my
arms. On the day of the rakhi, which was the 9th Amurd&#257;d, they
performed the same rites, and other castes by way of imitation did not
give up this bigotry; this year I agreed to it, and ordered that the
brahmans should bind strings (of cotton) and silk after the ancient
manner. On this day by chance fell the anniversary of the death of the
late king.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5493src" href="#xd24e5493" name=
"xd24e5493src">15</a> The commemoration of such an anniversary is one
of the standing rules and customs in Hindustan. Every year on the day
of the death of their fathers and those who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb247" href="#v1pb247" name=
"v1pb247">247</a>]</span>are dear to them, each according to his
circumstances and ability prepares food and all kinds of perfumes, and
the learned men, the respectable and other men assemble, and these
assemblies sometimes last a week. On this day I sent B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram to the venerated tomb to arrange the assemblage, and
10,000 rupees were given to ten trustworthy servants to divide among
fakirs and those who were in want.</p>
<p class="par">On the 15th of the month of Amurd&#257;d the offering of
Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n was laid before me. He had sent 28
elephants, 40 horses of that part of the country which are known as
<i>&#7789;&#257;nghan</i>, 50 eunuchs, 500 <i>parg&#257;la naf&#299;s
sit&#257;rk&#257;n&#775;&#299;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5506src"
href="#xd24e5506" name="xd24e5506src">16</a></p>
<p class="par">It had been made a rule that the events of the Subahs
should be reported according to the boundaries of each, and
news-writers from the Court had been appointed for this duty. This
being the rule that my revered father had laid down, I also observe it,
and much gain and great advantage are to be brought about by it and
information is acquired about the world and its inhabitants. If the
advantages of this were to be written down it would become a long
affair. At this time the news-writer of Lahore reported that at the end
of the month of T&#299;r ten men had gone from the city to
Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d, which lies at a distance of 12 kos. As the air
was very hot, they took shelter under a tree. Soon afterwards wind and
a dust-storm (<i>chakr&#299;</i>) sprang up, and when it blew on that
band of men they trembled, and nine of them died under the tree, and
only one remained alive; he was ill for a long time, and recovered with
great difficulty. In that neighbourhood such bad <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb248" href="#v1pb248" name=
"v1pb248">248</a>]</span>air was created that numerous birds who had
their nests in that tree all fell down and died, and that the wild
beasts (beasts of the plain, perhaps cattle) came and threw themselves
on to the cultivated fields, and, rolling about on the grass, gave up
their lives. In short, many animals perished. On Thursday, the 13th
Amurd&#257;d, having said my prayers (lit. counted my rosary), I
embarked on board a boat for the purpose of hunting in the village of
Samonagar, which is one of my fixed hunting-places. On the 3rd
S&#863;hahr&#299;war, K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, whom I had sent
for from the Deccan in order to despatch him to Iraq in company with
the ambassador of the ruler of Iran, came and waited on me at this
place. He offered 100 muhrs. As Samonagar was in Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s jagir, he had prepared a delightful
halting-place there on the bank of the river, and it pleased me
greatly. He presented offerings of an elephant and an emerald ring. The
former was put into my private stud. Up to the 6th S&#863;hahr&#299;war
I was employed in hunting. In these few days 47 head of antelope, male
and female, and other animals were killed. At this time Dil&#257;war
K&#863;h&#257;n sent as an offering a ruby, which was accepted. I sent
a special sword for Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n. I increased the mansab
of Hasan &#703;Al&#299; Turkum&#257;n, which was 1,000 personal and 700
horse, by 500 personal and 100 horse. At the end of Thursday, the 20th
of the same month, in the house of Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;, my solar
weighing took place. I weighed myself according to the usual custom
against metals and other things. I had this year attained to the age of
44 solar years. On the same day Y&#257;dg&#257;r &#703;Al&#299;,
ambassador of the ruler of Iran, and K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam,
who had been nominated to accompany him from this side, received their
leave to go. On Y&#257;dg&#257;r &#703;Al&#299; there were bestowed a
horse with a jewelled saddle, a jewelled sword, a vest without sleeves
with gold embroidery, an aigrette with feathers and a
<i>j&#299;g&#863;ha</i> (turban ornament), and 30,000 <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb249" href="#v1pb249" name=
"v1pb249">249</a>]</span>rupees in cash, altogether 40,000 rupees, and
on K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam a jewelled <i>khapwa</i> or
<i>ph&#363;l ka&#7789;&#257;ra</i> (a sort of dagger) with a pendant of
royal pearls. On the 22nd of the same month I visited the venerated
mausoleum of my revered father at Bihis&#863;ht&#257;b&#257;d, riding
on an elephant. On the way 5,000 rupees in small coin were scattered
round, and I gave other 5,000 rupees to K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n to
divide among the dervishes. Having said my evening prayers, I went back
to the city in a boat. As the house of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah was
on the bank of the river Jumna, I alighted there until the end of the
next day. Having accepted what pleased me of his offerings, I went
towards the palace; I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s house was
also on the bank of the river Jumna; at his request I disembarked there
with the ladies, and walked round the houses he had lately built there.
This delightful place pleased me greatly. He had produced suitable
offerings of cloth stuffs and jewels and other things; these were all
laid before me and most of them were approved. When it was near evening
I entered the auspicious palace. As the astrologers had fixed an hour
in this night for starting for Ajmir, when seven gharis of the night of
Monday, the 2nd S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n, corresponding with the 24th
S&#863;hahr&#299;war, had passed, I started in happiness and prosperity
with intent to go there from the capital of Agra. In this undertaking
two things were agreeable to me, one a pilgrimage to the splendid
mausoleum of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n
Chis&#863;ht&#299;, from the blessing of whose illustrious soul great
advantages had been derived by this dignified family, and whose
venerable shrine I had not visited after my accession to the throne.
The second was the defeat and beating back of the rebel R&#257;n&#257;
Amar Singh, who is one of the most considerable of the Zamindars and
Rajas of Hindustan, and whose headship and leadership and those of his
ancestors all the Rajas and Rays of this province agree to. The
administration has for long been in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb250" href="#v1pb250" name="v1pb250">250</a>]</span>hands of this
family, and they have long borne rule towards the East, that is the
P&#363;rab. They became in that time well known under the title of
Rajas. After this they fell on the Deccan<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5545src" href="#xd24e5545" name="xd24e5545src">17</a> and took
possession of many of the countries of that region. In the place of
Raja they have taken the title of R&#257;wal. After this they came into
the hill country of Mew&#257;t, and by degrees got into their
possession the fort of Chitor. From that date until this day, which is
in the eighth year after my accession, 1,471 years have
passed.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5548src" href="#xd24e5548" name=
"xd24e5548src">18</a></p>
<p class="par">There are twenty-six others of this caste who have ruled
for 1,010 years. They have the title of R&#257;wal, and from the
R&#257;wal who was first known as R&#257;wal down to R&#257;n&#257;
Amar Singh, the present R&#257;n&#257;, there are twenty-six
individuals who have ruled for the space of 461 years. During this long
time they have never bent their necks in obedience to any of the kings
of the country of Hindustan, and have for most of the time been
rebellious and troublesome, so much so that in the reign of the late
king B&#257;bar, R&#257;n&#257; S&#257;ng&#257; collected together all
the Rajas, Rays, and Zamindars of this province, and fought a battle in
the neighbourhood of Biy&#257;na with 180,000 horse and several lakhs
of foot-soldiers. By the aid of Almighty God and the assistance of
fortune the victorious army of Isl&#257;m prevailed against the infidel
forces, and a great defeat happened to them. The details of this battle
have been given in the Memoirs of King B&#257;bar. My revered father
(may his bright tomb be the abode of unending Grace) exerted himself
greatly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb251" href="#v1pb251" name=
"v1pb251">251</a>]</span>to put down these rebels, and several times
sent armies against them. In the twelfth year after his accession he
set himself to capture the fort of Chitor, which is one of the
strongest forts of the inhabited world, and to overthrow the kingdom of
the R&#257;n&#257;, and after four months and ten days of siege took it
by force from the men of Amar Singh&rsquo;s father, after much
fighting, and returned after destroying the fort. Every time the
victorious forces pressed him hard in order to capture him or make him
a fugitive, but it so happened that this was not effected. In the end
of his reign, on the same day and hour that he proceeded to the
conquest of the Deccan, he sent me with a large army and reliable
Sardars against the R&#257;n&#257;. By chance these two affairs, for
reasons which it would take too long to recount, did not succeed. At
last I came to the throne, and as this matter was only half done, the
first army I sent to the borders was this one. Making my son
Parw&#299;z its leader, the leading nobles who were at the capital were
appointed to this duty. I sent abundant treasure and artillery with
him. As every matter depends on its own season, at this juncture the
unhappy affair of K&#863;husrau occurred, and I had to pursue him to
the Panjab. The province and the capital of Agra remained void. I had
necessarily to write that Parw&#299;z should return with some of the
Amirs and take charge of Agra and the neighbourhood. In short, this
time again the matter of the R&#257;n&#257; did not go off as it
should. When by the favour of Allah my mind was at rest from
K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s disturbance, and Agra became again the alighting
place of the royal standards, a victorious army was appointed under the
leadership of Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n, &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n, and other leaders, and from that date up to the time
when the royal standards started for Ajmir his country was trodden
under foot by the victorious forces. As finally the affair did not
assume <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb252" href="#v1pb252" name=
"v1pb252">252</a>]</span>an approved form, it occurred to me that, as I
had nothing to do at Agra, and I was convinced that until I myself went
there the affair would not be set to rights, I left the fort of Agra
and alighted at the Dahrah garden. On the next day the festival of the
Dasahr&#257; took place. According to the usual custom they decorated
the elephants and horses, and I had them before me. As the mothers and
sisters of K&#863;husrau repeatedly represented to me that he was very
repentant of his deeds, the feelings (lit. sweat) of fatherly affection
having come into movement, I sent for him and determined that he should
come every day to pay his respects to me. I remained for eight days in
that garden. On the 28th news arrived that R&#257;ja R&#257;m D&#257;s,
who was doing service in Bangash and the neighbourhood of Kabul with
Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, had died. On the 1st of the month of Mihr I
marched from the garden, and dismissed K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n to
look after the capital of Agra and guard the treasure and the palace,
and gave him an elephant and a special robe (<i>fargul</i>). On the 2nd
Mihr news arrived that R&#257;ja B&#257;so had died in the thanah of
Shahabad,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5566src" href="#xd24e5566" name=
"xd24e5566src">19</a> which is on the border of the territory of Amar.
On the 10th of the same month I halted at R&#363;p B&#257;s, which has
now been named Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d. Formerly this district had been
given as jagir to R&#363;p K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779;. Afterwards,
bestowing it on Am&#257;nu-llah, son of Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n, I
ordered it to be called by his name. Eleven days were passed at this
halting-place. As it is a fixed hunting-place, I every day mounted to
go hunting, and in these few days 158 antelopes, male and female, and
other animals were killed. On the 25th of the month I marched from
Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d. On the 31st, corresponding with the 8th
Ramaz&#803;&#257;n, K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan, whom I
had sent for from Burhanpur, came and waited on me, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb253" href="#v1pb253" name=
"v1pb253">253</a>]</span>and presented as offerings 50 muhrs, 15
jewelled vessels, and an elephant, which I placed in my private stud.
On the 2nd &#256;b&#257;n, corresponding with the 10th
Ramaz&#803;&#257;n, news came of the death of Qil&#299;j
K&#863;h&#257;n. He was one of the ancient servants of the State, and
obtained the mercy of God in the 80th year of his age. He was employed
at Peshawar in the duty of keeping in order the Afghans full of
darkness.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5572src" href="#xd24e5572" name=
"xd24e5572src">20</a> His rank was 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse.
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n Dakhan&#299; was unrivalled in the
art of <i>p&#363;lta-b&#257;z&#299;</i>, which in the language of the
Dakhanis they call <i>yag&#257;nag&#299;</i>, and the Moguls
<i>s&#863;hams&#863;h&#299;r-b&#257;z&#299;</i>,
&lsquo;sword-play&rsquo; (fencing). For some time I studied it with
him. At this time I exalted him with the title of Warzis&#863;h
K&#863;h&#257;n (Exercise-K&#863;h&#257;n). I had established a custom
that deserving people and dervishes should be brought before me every
night, so that I might bestow on them, after personal enquiry into
their condition, land, or gold, or clothes. Amongst these was a man who
represented to me that the name Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, according to the
science of <i>abjad</i> (numerals reckoned by letters), corresponded to
the great name &ldquo;Allah Akbar.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5587src" href="#xd24e5587" name="xd24e5587src">21</a> Considering
this a good omen, I gave him who discovered (this coincidence) land, a
horse, cash, and clothing. On Monday, the 5th S&#863;haww&#257;l,
corresponding to the 26th &#256;b&#257;n, the hour for entering Ajmir
was fixed. On the morning of the said day I went towards it. When the
fort and the buildings of the shrine of the revered K&#863;hw&#257;ja
appeared in sight, I traversed on foot the remainder of the road, about
a kos. I placed trustworthy men on both sides of the road, who went
along giving money to fakirs and the necessitous. When four gharis of
day had passed, I entered the city and its inhabited portion, and in
the fifth ghari had the honour of visiting the venerated mausoleum.
After visiting it I proceeded to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb254"
href="#v1pb254" name="v1pb254">254</a>]</span>the auspicious palace,
and the next day ordered all those present in this honoured
resting-place, both small and great, belonging to the city, and
travellers, to be brought before me, that they might be made happy with
numerous gifts according to their real circumstances. On the 7th
&#256;z&#817;ar I went to see and shoot on the tank of Pushkar, which
is one of the established praying-places of the Hindus, with regard to
the perfection of which they give (excellent) accounts that are
incredible to any intelligence, and which is situated at a distance of
three kos from Ajmir. For two or three days I shot water-fowl on that
tank, and returned to Ajmir. Old and new temples which, in the language
of the infidels, they call Deohara<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5593src"
href="#xd24e5593" name="xd24e5593src">22</a> are to be seen around this
tank. Among them R&#257;n&#257; S&#863;hankar, who is the uncle of the
rebel Amar, and in my kingdom is among the high nobles, had built a
Deohara of great magnificence, on which 100,000 rupees had been spent.
I went to see that temple. I found a form cut out of black stone, which
from the neck above was in the shape of a pig&rsquo;s head, and the
rest of the body was like that of a man. The worthless religion of the
Hindus is this, that once on a time for some particular object the
Supreme Ruler thought it necessary to show himself in this shape; on
this account they hold it dear and worship it.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5596src" href="#xd24e5596" name="xd24e5596src">23</a> I ordered
them to break that hideous form and throw it into the tank. After
looking at this building there appeared a white dome on the top of a
hill, to which men were coming from all quarters. When I asked about
this they said that a Jog&#299; lived there, and when the simpletons
come to see him he places in their hands a handful<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e5599src" href="#xd24e5599" name="xd24e5599src">24</a> of
flour, which they put into their mouths and imitate the cry
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb255" href="#v1pb255" name=
"v1pb255">255</a>]</span>of an animal which these fools have at some
time injured, in order that by this act their sins may be blotted out.
I ordered them to break down that place and turn the Jog&#299; out of
it, as well as to destroy the form of an idol there was in the dome.
Another belief they have is that there is no bottom to this tank. After
enquiry it appeared that it is nowhere deeper than 12 cubits. I also
measured it round and it was about 1&frac12; kos.</p>
<p class="par">On the 16th &#256;z&#817;ar news came that the watchmen
had marked down a tigress. I immediately went there and killed it with
a gun and returned. After a few days a nilgaw (blue bull) was killed,
of which I ordered them to take off the skin in my presence and cook it
as food for the poor. Over 200 people assembled and ate it, and I gave
money with my own hand to each of them. In the same month news came
that the Franks of Goa had, contrary to treaty, plundered four cargo
vessels<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5612src" href="#xd24e5612" name=
"xd24e5612src">25</a> that frequented the port of Surat in the
neighbourhood of that port: and, making prisoners a large number of
Musulmans, had taken possession of the goods and chattels that were in
those ships. This being very disagreeable to my mind, I despatched
Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n, who is in charge of the port, on the 18th
&#256;z&#817;ar, giving him a horse and elephant and a dress of honour,
to obtain compensation for this affair. On account of the great
activity and good services of Y&#363;suf K&#863;h&#257;n and
Bah&#257;duru-l-mulk in the Subah of the Deccan, I sent standards for
them.</p>
<p class="par">It has been written that my chief object, after my visit
to the K&#863;hw&#257;ja, was to put a stop to the affair of the rebel
R&#257;n&#257;. On this account I determined to remain myself at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb256" href="#v1pb256" name=
"v1pb256">256</a>]</span>Ajmir and send on B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram, my fortunate son. This idea was a very good one, and on
this account, on the 6th of Day, at the hour fixed upon, I despatched
him in happiness and triumph. I presented him with a <i>qab&#257;</i>
(outer coat) of gold brocade with jewelled flowers and pearls round the
flowers, a brocaded turban with strings of pearls, a gold woven sash
with chains of pearls, one of my private elephants called Fath&#803;
Gaj, with trappings, a special horse, a jewelled sword, and a jewelled
<i>khapwa</i>, with a <i>ph&#363;l ka&#7789;&#257;ra</i>. In addition
to the men first appointed to this duty under the leadership of
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, I sent 12,000 more horse with my son,
and honoured their leaders, each according to his condition, with
special horses and elephants and robes of honour, and dismissed them.
Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n was nominated to the
paymastership of this army. At the same time &#7778;afdar
K&#863;h&#257;n was despatched to the government of Kashmir in place of
H&#257;shim K&#863;h&#257;n. He received a horse and robe of honour. On
Wednesday, the 11th, K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan was made
general paymaster (<i>bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;-kul</i>), and received a
dress of honour. I had ordered them to make a large caldron<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5638src" href="#xd24e5638" name=
"xd24e5638src">26</a> at Agra for the revered mausoleum of the
K&#863;hw&#257;ja. On this day it was brought, and I ordered them to
cook food for the poor in that pot, and collect together the poor of
Ajmir to feed them whilst I was there. Five thousand people assembled,
and all ate of this food to their fill. After the food I gave money to
each of the dervishes with my own hand. At this time Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of Bengal, was promoted to the mansab of
6,000 personal and horse, and a flag was given to Mukarram
K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Mu&#703;&#257;z&#804;z&#804;am
K&#863;h&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">On the 1st of Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;, corresponding with
the 10th Muh&#803;arram, 1023 (20th February, 1614), I left
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb257" href="#v1pb257" name=
"v1pb257">257</a>]</span>Ajmir to hunt nilgaw, and returned on the 9th.
I halted at the fountain of H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804; Jam&#257;l,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5651src" href="#xd24e5651" name=
"xd24e5651src">27</a> two kos from the city, and passed the night of
Friday<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5654src" href="#xd24e5654" name=
"xd24e5654src">28</a> there. At the end of the day I entered the city.
In these twenty days ten nilgaw had been killed. As the good service of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n and the smallness of his force for the
defence and government of Agra and that neighbourhood were brought to
my notice, I increased his mansab by 500 personal and 100 horse. On the
same day Ab&#363;-l-fath&#803; Dakhan&#299; came from his jagir and
waited on me. On the 3rd of the same month news came of the death of
Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n; he had died on Thursday, the 5th Rajab, in
the year 1022 (21st August, 1613). In one day, without any previous
illness, this inevitable event occurred. He was one of those born and
brought up in the house (house-born). The naturally good disposition
and knowledge of affairs that showed themselves in him were seen in no
one else. He ruled Bengal with entire authority, and brought within the
civil jurisdiction of the province countries that had never previously
come under the sway of any of the jagirdars or into the possession of
any of the Chiefs of the State. If death had not overtaken him he would
have done perfect service.</p>
<p class="par">The K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am had himself prayed
that the illustrious prince should be appointed to the campaign against
the R&#257;n&#257;, yet, notwithstanding all kinds of encouragement and
gratification on the part of my son (S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n), he
would not apply himself to the task, but proceeded to act in his own
unworthy manner. When this was heard by me, I sent Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
H&#803;usain, who was one of my most trusty attendants, to him, and
sent affectionate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb258" href=
"#v1pb258" name="v1pb258">258</a>]</span>messages to him to say that
when he was at Burhanpur he had daily begged this duty of me, as he
considered it equivalent to the happiness of both worlds, and had said
in meetings and assemblies that if he should be killed in this
enterprise he would be a martyr, and if he prevailed, a
g&#863;h&#257;z&#299;. I had given him whatever support and assistance
of artillery he had asked for. After this he had written that without
the movement of the royal standards to those regions the completion of
the affair was not free of difficulty. By his counsel I had come to
Ajmir, and this neighbourhood had been thus honoured and dignified. Now
that he had himself prayed for the prince, and everything had been
carried out according to his counsel, why did he withdraw his foot from
the field of battle and enter the place of disagreement? To
B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram, from whom up till now I had never parted,
and whom I sent in pure reliance on his (K&#863;h&#257;n
A&#703;z&#804;am&rsquo;s) knowledge of affairs, he should show loyalty
and approved good-will, and never be neglectful day or night of his
duty to my son. If, contrariwise, he should draw back his foot from
what he had agreed to, he must know that there would be mischief.
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain went, and impressed these words on his
mind in the same detailed way. It was of no avail, as he would not go
back from his folly and determination. When B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram saw that his being in the affair was a cause of
disturbance, he kept him under observation and represented that his
being there was in no way fitting, and he was acting thus and spoiling
matters simply on account of the connection he had with
K&#863;husrau.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5663src" href="#xd24e5663"
name="xd24e5663src">29</a> I then ordered Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n
to go and bring him from Udaipur, and told Muh&#803;ammad Taq&#299;,
the diwan of buildings, to go to Mandes&#363;r and bring his children
and dependants to Ajmir.</p>
<p class="par">On the 11th of the month news came that Dul&#299;p, son
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb259" href="#v1pb259" name=
"v1pb259">259</a>]</span>of R&#257;y Singh, who was of a seditious and
rebellious disposition, had been heavily defeated by his younger
brother, R&#257;o S&#363;raj Singh, who had been sent against him, and
that he was making disturbance in one of the districts of the Sarkar of
H&#803;i&#7779;&#7779;ar. About this time H&#257;shim of K&#863;host,
the faujd&#257;r, and the jagirdars of that neighbourhood seized him,
and sent him as a prisoner to Court. As he had misbehaved repeatedly,
he was capitally punished, and this was a warning to many of the
seditious. In reward for this service an increase of 500 personal and
200 horse was made to the mansab of R&#257;o S&#363;raj Singh. On the
14th of the month a representation came from my son B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram that the elephant &#703;&#256;lam-gum&#257;n, of which
the R&#257;n&#257; was very fond, together with seventeen other
elephants, had fallen into the hands of the warriors of the victorious
army, and that his master would also soon be captured.</p>

Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s words seem to imply that he caused the
fowl&rsquo;s leg to be broken in order to try the experiment. Manucci,
i, 55, has a good deal to say about <i>m&#363;m&#299;y&#257;</i>,
though he admits that he had not himself witnessed its effects. I do
not find that H&#803;&#257;j&#299; B&#257;b&#257; descants on its
virtues, though at the end of the first chapter he says that his mother
gave him an unguent which she said would cure all fractures. The
Persian translator, no doubt rightly, has rendered the word
&lsquo;unguent&rsquo; by <i>m&#363;m&#299;y&#257;</i>. With regard to
the derivation of the word, may it not be connected with <i>mom</i>,

Blochmann, p. 184, and Wilson&rsquo;s Glossary. Baday&#363;n&#299;
(Lowe, p. 269) speaks of Akbar&rsquo;s wearing the
<i>r&#257;kh&#299;</i> on the 8th day of Virgo. I do not know why
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r calls the day after the last day of S&#257;wan the
first day of the New Year. Perhaps <i>r&#363;z-i-duyam</i> here means
&lsquo;another day,&rsquo; and not &lsquo;the next day&rsquo;; but
then, if so, why is it the rakhi day, for that is in S&#257;wan? The
Hindu New Year begins in Bais&#257;kh (April). It will be observed from
Jarrett, ii, 17, that S&#257;wan is also the name of a month of a
particular length. Perhaps Jah&#257;ng&#299;r has confused the two
things.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd24e5448src">&uarr;</a></p>

<p class="par first">The commencement of the ninth year after my
auspicious accession, corresponding with the Hijra year 1023
(1614).</p>
<p class="par">Two watches and one ghari had passed on the night of
Friday, the 9th &#7778;afar (21st March, 1614), when the world-warming
sun shed his rays on the constellation of Aries, which is his house of
dignity and honour; it was the first morning of the month of
Farward&#299;n. The assembly for the New Year&rsquo;s festival took
place in the pleasant regions of Ajmir, and at the time of entry (of
the sun into Aries), which was the propitious hour, I seated myself on
the throne of good fortune. They had in the usual manner decorated the
palace with rare cloth-stuffs and jewels and gem-decked things. At this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb260" href="#v1pb260" name=
"v1pb260">260</a>]</span>auspicious moment the elephant
&#703;&#256;lam-gum&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5679src" href=
"#xd24e5679" name="xd24e5679src">1</a> which was fit to be entered in
the private stud, with the seventeen other male and female elephants
which my son B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram had sent of the
R&#257;n&#257;&rsquo;s elephants, were presented before me, and the
hearts of the loyal rejoiced. On the 2nd day of the New Year, knowing
it to be propitious for a ride, I mounted it and scattered about much
money. On the 3rd I conferred on I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n a
mansab of 3,000 personal and 1,000 horse, increasing thus that which he
had already, which was of 2,000 personal and 500 horse, and I
distinguished him with the title of &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n,
with which title two of his family had been previously honoured. I also
increased the mansab of Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n by 500 personal
and 200 horse. At the same time I promoted I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah
to the mansab of 5,000 personal and 2,000 horse. At the request of
B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram I increased the mansab of Saif
K&#863;h&#257;n B&#257;rha by 500 personal and 200 horse, that of
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n by the same number, that of Kis&#863;han
Singh by 500 horse, and that of Sarfar&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n by 500
personal and 300 horse. On Sunday, the 10th, the offering of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n was produced before me, and on the 14th
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah produced his own offering. From these two
offerings I took what pleased me and gave back the rest. Ch&#299;n
Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, with his brothers, relations, and the army
and retinue of his father, came from Kabul<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5682src" href="#xd24e5682" name="xd24e5682src">2</a> and waited
on me. Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n, who had a mansab of 700
personal and 300 horse, having been promoted to that of 1,500 personal
and 600 horse, was appointed jointly with K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan to the exalted dignity of paymaster of the
household. On the 15th of this month Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n, who
had been appointed to bring K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am and his
son &#703;Abdu-llah, came and waited <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb261" href="#v1pb261" name="v1pb261">261</a>]</span>on me. On the
19th the assembly of honour was held. On that day the offering of
Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n was laid before me, and I sent a private
elephant called R&#363;p Sundar for my son Parw&#299;z. When that day
had passed I ordered them to deliver K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am
into the charge of &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, that he might keep
him in the fort of Gwalior. As my object in sending him to the fort was
in case some disagreement and disturbance should occur in the matter of
the R&#257;n&#257; in consequence of the attachment that he had to
K&#863;husrau, I ordered him not to be kept in the fort like a
prisoner, but that they should provide everything necessary for his
comfort and convenience in the way of eating and clothing. On the same
day I promoted Ch&#299;n Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n to a mansab of
2,500 personal and 700 horse. To the rank of T&#257;j K&#863;h&#257;n,
who had been appointed to the charge of the province of Bhakar, I added
500 personal and horse. On the 18th Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht I forbade
K&#863;husrau to pay his respects. The reason was this, that through
the affection and fatherly love (I bore him) and the prayers of his
mother and sisters, I had ordered again that he should come every day
to pay his respects (<i>k&#363;rnis&#863;h</i>). As his appearance
showed no signs of openness and happiness, and he was always mournful
and dejected in mind, I accordingly ordered that he should not come to
pay his respects. In the time of my revered father, Muz&#804;affar
H&#803;usain M&#299;rz&#257; and Rustam M&#299;rz&#257;, sons of
Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain M&#299;rz&#257;, nephews of
S&#863;h&#257;h T&#804;ahm&#257;sp &#7778;afaw&#299;, who had in their
possession Qandahar and Zam&#299;nd&#257;war and that neighbourhood,
sent petitions to the effect that in consequence of the nearness to
Khurasan and the coming of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n &#362;zbeg
to that country, they could not leave the charge of looking after the
country and come (to pay their respects), but that if he (Akbar) would
send one of the servants of the palace they would hand over the country
to him, and themselves come to pay their respects. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb262" href="#v1pb262" name=
"v1pb262">262</a>]</span>As they repeatedly made this request, he sent
S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, who is now honoured with the title
of K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n, to the governorship of Qandahar and
Zam&#299;nd&#257;war and that neighbourhood, and wrote firmans full of
favour to the M&#299;rz&#257;s summoning them to the Court. After their
arrival favours appropriate to the case of each were bestowed on them,
and he gave them a territory equal to two or three times the
collections of Qandahar. In the end, the management expected from them
was not achieved, and by degrees the territory deteriorated.
Muz&#804;affar H&#803;usain M&#299;rz&#257; died during the lifetime of
my revered father, and he sent M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam with the
Khankhanan to the Subah of the Deccan, where he had a small jagir. When
the throne was honoured by my succession, I sent for him from the
Deccan with the intention of showing him favour and sending him to one
of the border territories. About the time he came M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; Tark&#863;h&#257;n, who held the governorship of
Thatta and Qandahar and that neighbourhood, died. It occurred to me to
send him to Thatta, so that he might show there his natural good
qualities and administer that country in an approved manner. I promoted
him to a mansab of 5,000 personal and horse, 200,000 rupees were given
to him for expenses, and I despatched him to the Subah of Thatta. My
belief was that he would do good service<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5693src" href="#xd24e5693" name="xd24e5693src">3</a> on those
borders. In opposition to my expectation he did no service, and
committed so much oppression that many people complained of his
wickedness. Such news of him was heard that it was considered necessary
to recall him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb263" href="#v1pb263"
name="v1pb263">263</a>]</span>One of the servants of the Court was
appointed to summon him, and I sent for him to Court. On the 26th
Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht they brought him. As he had committed great
oppression on the people of God, and inquiry into this was due
according to the requirements of justice, I handed him over to
An&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299; Singh-dalan that he might enquire into the
facts, and that if guilty he might receive prompt punishment and be a
warning to others. In those days the news also came of the defeat of
Ah&#803;d&#257;d, the Afghan. The facts are that Mu&#703;taqid
K&#863;h&#257;n came to P&#363;lam<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5698src"
href="#xd24e5698" name="xd24e5698src">4</a> Guzar (ferry?), in the
district of Peshawar, with an army, and K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n
with another force in Afghanistan and blocked the path of that rascal
(lit. black-faced one). Meanwhile a letter came to Mu&#703;taqid
K&#863;h&#257;n from Pish Bulagh that Ah&#803;d&#257;d had gone to
Ko&#7789; T&#299;r&#257;h, which is 8 kos from Jalalabad, with a large
number of horse and foot, and had killed a few of those who had chosen
to be loyal and obey, and made prisoners of others, and was about to
send them to T&#299;r&#257;h, and intended to make a raid on Jalalabad
and Pish Bulagh. Immediately on hearing this news Mu&#703;taqid
K&#863;h&#257;n started in great haste with the troops he had with him.
When he arrived at Pish Bulagh he sent out spies to ascertain about the
enemy. On the morning of Wednesday, the 6th, news reached him that
Ah&#803;d&#257;d was in the same place. Placing his trust on the favour
of God, which is on the side of this suppliant at the throne of Allah,
he divided the royal army into two, and went towards the enemy, who,
with 4,000 or 5,000 experienced men, had seated themselves haughtily in
complete carelessness, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb264" href=
"#v1pb264" name="v1pb264">264</a>]</span>and did not suspect that
besides K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n&rsquo;s there was an army in the
neighbourhood that could oppose itself to them. When news came that the
royal forces were coming against that ill-fortuned man, and the signs
of an army were becoming manifest, in a state of bewilderment he
distributed his men into four bodies, and seating himself on an
eminence a gunshot away, to get to which was a difficult matter, he
sent his men to fight. The musketeers of the victorious army assailed
the rebel with bullets, and sent a large number to hell. Mu&#703;taqid
K&#863;h&#257;n took the centre of his army to his advanced guard, and,
not giving the enemy more than time to shoot off their arrows two or
three times, swept them clean away, and pursuing them for 3 or 4 kos,
killed nearly 1,500 of them, horse and foot. Those left of the sword
took to flight, most of them wounded and with their arms thrown away.
The victorious army remained for the night in the same place on the
battlefield, and in the morning proceeded with 600 decapitated
heads<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5706src" href="#xd24e5706" name=
"xd24e5706src">5</a> towards Peshawar and made pillars of the heads
there. Five hundred horses and innumerable cattle and property and many
weapons fell into their hands. The prisoners of T&#299;r&#257;h were
released, and on this side no well-known men were killed. On the night
of Thursday, the 1st of K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d, I proceeded towards
Pushkar to shoot tigers, and on Friday killed two of them with a gun.
On the same day it was represented to me that Naq&#299;b
K&#863;h&#257;n had died. The aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n was one of the
Saif&#299; Sayyids, and was originally from Qazwin. The tomb of his
father, M&#299;r &#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f, is at Ajmir. Two months
before his death his wife,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5713src" href=
"#xd24e5713" name="xd24e5713src">6</a> between whom and her husband
there was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb265" href="#v1pb265" name=
"v1pb265">265</a>]</span>a great affection, and who for twelve days was
ill with fever, drank the unpleasant draught of death. I ordered them
to bury him by the side of his wife, whom they had placed in the
K&#863;hw&#257;ja&rsquo;s venerated mausoleum. As Mu&#703;taqid
K&#863;h&#257;n had done approved service in the fight with
Ah&#803;d&#257;d, in reward he was exalted with the title of
Las&#863;hkar K&#863;h&#257;n. Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n, who had
been sent to Udaipur in the service of B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram and
to convey certain orders, came on the 7th K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d and
gave good account of the rules and regulations made by B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram. Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, who in the days
of my princehood was my servant, and whom after my accession I had made
bakhshi in this army, and who had obtained favour, gave up the deposit
of his life on the 12th of the same month. M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam, as
he showed signs of repentance and regret for his misdeeds, and
generosity demanded that his faults should be pardoned, was, in the end
of the month, summoned to my presence, and I satisfied his mind, and
having given him a dress of honour, ordered him to pay his respects to
me. On the night of Sunday, the 11th of the month of T&#299;r, a female
elephant in the private elephant stud gave birth to a young one in my
presence. I had repeatedly ordered them to ascertain the period of
their gestation; at last it became evident that for a female young one
it was 18 months and for a male 19 months. In opposition to the birth
of a human being, which is in most cases by a head delivery, young
elephants are born with their feet first. When the young one was born,
the mother scattered dust upon it with her foot, and began to be kind
and to pet it. The young one for an instant remained fallen, and then
rising, made towards its mother&rsquo;s breasts. On the 14th the
assembly of Gul&#257;b-p&#257;s&#863;h&#299; (sprinkling of rose-water)
took place; from former times this has been known as
<i>&#257;b-p&#257;s&#863;h&#299;</i> (water-sprinkling), and has become
established from amongst customs of former <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb266" href="#v1pb266" name=
"v1pb266">266</a>]</span>days. On the 5th Amurd&#257;d (middle July,
1614) came news of the death of R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5723src" href="#xd24e5723" name="xd24e5723src">7</a>
The aforesaid Raja was one of the chief officers of my revered father.
As I had sent many servants of the State to serve in the Deccan, I also
appointed him. After his death in that service, I sent for
M&#299;rz&#257; Bh&#257;o Singh, who was his legitimate heir. As from
the time when I was prince he had done much service with me, although
the chiefship and headship of their family, according to the Hindu
custom, should go to Mah&#257; Singh, son<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5726src" href="#xd24e5726" name="xd24e5726src">8</a> of Jagat
Singh, the Raja&rsquo;s eldest son, who had died in the latter&rsquo;s
lifetime, I did not accept him, but I dignified Bh&#257;o Singh with
the title of M&#299;rz&#257; R&#257;ja, and raised him to the mansab of
4,000 personal and 3,000 horse. I also gave him Amber, the native place
of his ancestors, and, soothing and consoling the mind of Mah&#257;
Singh, increased his former mansab by 500, and gave him as an
in&#703;&#257;m the territory of Garha.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5736src" href="#xd24e5736" name="xd24e5736src">9</a> I also sent
him a jewelled dagger belt, a horse, and dress of honour. On the 8th of
this month of Amurd&#257;d I found a change in my health, and by
degrees was seized with fever and headache. For fear that some injury
might occur to the country and the servants of God, I kept this secret
from most of those familiar with and near to me, and did not inform the
physicians and hakims. A few days passed in this manner, and I only
imparted this to N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam than whom I did not think
anyone was fonder of me; I abstained from eating heavy foods, and,
contenting myself with a little light food, went every day, according
to my rule, to the public D&#299;w&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;na (hall of
audience), and entered the Jharokha and <i>ghusal-k&#863;h&#257;na</i>
(parlour) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb267" href="#v1pb267" name=
"v1pb267">267</a>]</span>in my usual manner, until signs of weakness
showed themselves in my skin.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5744src" href=

my physicians who were trustworthy, such as H&#803;ak&#299;m

and H&#803;ak&#299;m &#703;Abdu-s&#863;h-S&#863;hak&#363;r. As the
fever did not change, and for three nights I took my usual wine, it
brought on greater weakness. In the time of disquietude, and when
weakness prevailed over me, I went to the mausoleum of the revered
K&#863;hw&#257;ja, and in that blessed abode prayed to God Almighty for
recovery, and agreed to give alms and charity. God Almighty, in His
pure grace and mercy, bestowed on me the robe of honour of health, and
by degrees I recovered. The headache, which had been very severe,
subsided under the remedies of H&#803;ak&#299;m
&#703;Abdu-s&#863;h-S&#863;hak&#363;r, and in the space of twenty-two
days my state returned to what it was before. The servants of the
palace, and indeed the whole of the people, made offerings for this
great bounty. I accepted the alms of no one, and ordered that everyone
in his own house should distribute what he wished among the poor. On
the 10th S&#863;hahr&#299;war news came that T&#257;j K&#863;h&#257;n,
the Afghan, governor of Thatta,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5752src"
href="#xd24e5752" name="xd24e5752src">12</a> had died; he was one of
the old nobles of the State.</p>
<p class="par">During my illness it had occurred to me that when I
completely recovered, inasmuch as I was inwardly an ear-bored slave of
the K&#863;hw&#257;ja (Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n) and was indebted to
him for my existence, I should openly make holes in my ears and be
enrolled among his ear-marked slaves. On Thursday, 12th
S&#863;hahr&#299;war,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5757src" href=
"#xd24e5757" name="xd24e5757src">13</a> corresponding to the month of
Rajab, I made holes in my ears and drew into each a shining pearl. When
the servants of the palace and my loyal friends saw this, both those
who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb268" href="#v1pb268" name=
"v1pb268">268</a>]</span>were in the presence and some who were in the
distant borders diligently and eagerly made holes in their ears, and
adorned the beauty of sincerity with pearls and rubies which were in
the private treasury, and were bestowed on them, until by degrees the
infection caught the Ahadis and others. At the end of the day of
Thursday, the 22nd of the said month, corresponding with the 10th
S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n, the meeting for my solar weighing was arranged
in my private audience hall, and the usual observances were carried
out. On the same day M&#299;rz&#257; R&#257;ja Bh&#257;o Singh,
gratified and prosperous, returned to his native country with the
promise that he would not delay (there) more than two or three months.
On the 27th of the month of Mihr news came that Far&#299;d&#363;n
K&#863;h&#257;n Barl&#257;s had died at Udaipur. In the clan of
Barl&#257;s no leader remained but he. As his tribe had many claims on
this State and endless connection with it, I patronised his son Mihr
&#703;Al&#299;, and raised him to the mansab of 1,000 personal and
horse. On account of the approved services of K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n, I increased by 1,000 his mansab, which became 6,000
personal and 5,000 horse, original and increase. On the 6th
&#256;b&#257;n the <i>qar&#257;wuls</i>
(<i>s&#863;hik&#257;r&#299;s</i>) reported that three tigers had been
met at a distance of 6 kos. Starting after midday, I killed all three
of them with a gun. On the 8th of the month the festival of the
Dew&#257;l&#299; came on. I ordered the attendants of the palace to
have games with each other for two or three nights in my presence;
winnings and losings took place. On the 8th of this month they brought
to Ajmir the body of Sikandar Mu&#703;&#299;n Qar&#257;wul
(S&#863;hik&#257;r&#299;), who was one of my old attendants and had
done much service for me when I was prince, from Udaipur, which was the
place where my son Sult&#804;&#257;n K&#863;hurram was staying. I
ordered the qarawuls and his fellow-tribesmen to take his body and bury
it on the bank of R&#257;n&#257; S&#863;hankar&rsquo;s tank. He was a
good servant to me. On the 12th &#256;z&#817;ar two daughters whom
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb269" href="#v1pb269" name=
"v1pb269">269</a>]</span>Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n in his lifetime had
taken from the Zamindar of K&#363;ch (Behar), whose country is on the
boundary of the eastern provinces, together with his son and 94
elephants, were brought before me. Some of the elephants were placed in
my private stud. On the same day, H&#363;s&#863;hang, Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s son, came from Bengal, and had the good fortune
to kiss the threshold, and presented as offerings two elephants, 100
muhrs, and 100 rupees. On one particular night in Day I dreamt that the
late king (Akbar) said to me: &ldquo;B&#257;b&#257;, forgive for my
sake the fault of &#703;Az&#299;z K&#863;h&#257;n, who is the
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am.&rdquo; After this dream, I decided to
summon him from the fort (of Gwalior).</p>
<p class="par">There is a ravine in the neighbourhood of Ajmir that is
very beautiful. At the end of this ravine a spring appears which is
collected in a long and broad tank, and is the best water in Ajmir.
This valley and spring are well known as H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804;
Jam&#257;l. When I crossed over to this place I ordered a suitable
building to be made there, as the place was good and fit for
developing. In the course of a year a house and grounds were made
there, the like of which those<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5772src"
href="#xd24e5772" name="xd24e5772src">14</a> who travel round the world
cannot point out. They made a basin 40 gaz by 40, and made the water of
the spring rise up in the basin by a fountain. The fountain leaps up 10
or 12 gaz. Buildings are laid on the edge of this basin, and in the
same way above, where the tank and fountain are, they have made
agreeable places and enchanting halls and resting-rooms pleasant to the
senses. These have been constructed and finished off in a masterly
style by skilled painters and clever artists. As I desired that it
should be called by a name <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb270" href=
"#v1pb270" name="v1pb270">270</a>]</span>connected with my august name,
I gave it the name of Chas&#863;hma-i-N&#363;r, or &lsquo;the fountain
of light.&rsquo; In short, the one fault it has is this, that it ought
to have been in a large city, or at a place by which men frequently
pass. From the day on which it was completed I have often passed
Thursdays and Fridays there. I ordered that they should think out a
chronogram for its completion. Sa&#703;&#299;d&#257;
G&#299;l&#257;n&#299;, the head of the goldsmiths, discovered it in
this clever hemistich:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The palace<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5780src"
href="#xd24e5780" name="xd24e5780src">15</a> of S&#863;h&#257;h
N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rdquo; (1024).</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">I ordered them to put a stone with this carved
upon it on the top of the portico of the building.</p>
<p class="par">In the beginning of the month of Day, merchants came
from Persia and brought pomegranates of Yazd and melons from
K&#257;r&#299;z, which are the best of Khurasan melons, so many that
all the servants of the Court and the Amirs of the frontiers obtained a
portion of them and were very grateful to the True Giver (God) for
them. I had never had such melons and pomegranates. It seemed as if I
had never had a pomegranate or a melon before. Every year I had had
melons from Badakhshan and pomegranates from Kabul, but they bore no
comparison with the Yazd pomegranates and the K&#257;r&#299;z melons.
As my revered father (may God&rsquo;s light be his witness!) had a
great liking for fruit, I was very grieved that such fruits had not
come to Hindustan from Persia in his victorious time, that he might
have enjoyed and profited by them. I have the same regret for the
<i>Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; &#703;it&#804;r</i> (so-called otto of
roses), that his nostrils were not gratified with such essences. This
&#703;it&#804;r is a discovery which was made during my reign through
the efforts of the mother of N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam. When she was
making rose-water <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb271" href=
"#v1pb271" name="v1pb271">271</a>]</span>a scum formed on the surface
of the dishes into which the hot rose-water was poured from the jugs.
She collected this scum little by little; when much rose-water was
obtained a sensible portion of the scum was collected. It is of such
strength in perfume that if one drop be rubbed on the palm of the hand
it scents a whole assembly, and it appears as if many red rosebuds had
bloomed at once. There is no other scent of equal excellence to it. It
restores hearts that have gone and brings back withered souls. In
reward for that invention I presented a string of pearls to the
inventress. Sal&#299;ma<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5792src" href=
"#xd24e5792" name="xd24e5792src">16</a> Sult&#804;&#257;n Begam (may
the lights of God be on her tomb) was present, and she gave this oil

<p class="par">Great difference appeared in the climates of India. In
this month of Day, in Lahore, which is between Persia and Hindustan,
the mulberry-tree bore fruit of as much sweetness and fine flavour as
in its ordinary season. For some days people were delighted by eating
it. The news-writers of that place wrote this. In the same days
Bak&#863;htar K&#863;h&#257;n Kal&#257;want, who was closely connected
with &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, inasmuch as he (&#703;&#256;dil)
married his own brother&rsquo;s daughter to him, and made him his
preceptor in singing and <i>durpat</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5799src" href="#xd24e5799" name="xd24e5799src">17</a>
<i>guftan</i>, appeared in the habit of a dervish. Summoning him and
enquiring into his circumstances, I endeavoured to honour him. In the
first assembly I gave him 10,000 rupees in cash and 50 pieces of cloth
of all sorts and a string of pearls, and having made him a guest of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, ordered him to enquire into his
circumstances. It did not appear whether he had come without
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s permission, or the latter
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb272" href="#v1pb272" name=
"v1pb272">272</a>]</span>had sent him in this guise in order that he
might find out the designs of this Court and bring him news about them.
Considering his relationship to &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, it is
most probable that he has not come without &#703;&#256;dil
K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s knowledge. A report by M&#299;r
Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain, who at this time was (our)
ambassador at Bijapur, corroborates this idea, for he writes that
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n has, on account of the kindness which
has been shown by H.M. (Jah&#257;ng&#299;r) to Bak&#863;htar
K&#863;h&#257;n, been very gracious to him (Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n).
Every day he has shown him more and more favour, keeps him beside him
at nights, and recites to him durpats, which he (&#703;&#256;dil
K&#863;h&#257;n) has composed, and which he calls
<i>nauras</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e5818src" href="#xd24e5818"
name="xd24e5818src">18</a> (Juvenilia). &ldquo;The remainder of the
facts will be written on the day when I get my dismissal.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In these days they brought a bird from the country of
Z&#299;rb&#257;d (Sumatra, etc., Blochmann, p. 616) which was coloured
like a parrot, but had a smaller body. One of its peculiarities is that
it lays hold with its feet of the branch or perch on which they may
have placed it and then makes a somersault, and remains in this
position all night and whispers to itself. When day comes it seats
itself on the top of the branch. Though they say that animals also have
worship, yet it is most likely that this practice is instinctive. It
never drinks water, and water acts like poison upon it, though other
birds subsist on water.</p>
<p class="par">In the month<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5828src" href=
"#xd24e5828" name="xd24e5828src">19</a> of Bahman there came pieces of
good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb273" href="#v1pb273" name=
"v1pb273">273</a>]</span>news one after the other. The first was that
the R&#257;n&#257; Amar Singh had elected for obedience and service to
the Court. The circumstances of this affair are these. My son of lofty
fortune, Sult&#804;&#257;n K&#863;hurram, by dint of placing a great
many posts, especially in some places where most people said it was
impossible to place them on account of the badness of the air and water
and the wild nature of the localities, and by dint of moving the royal
forces one after another in pursuit, without regard to the heat or
excessive rain, and making prisoners of the families of the inhabitants
of that region, brought matters with the R&#257;n&#257; to such a pass
that it became clear to him that if this should happen to him again he
must either fly the country or be made prisoner. Being without remedy,
he chose obedience and loyalty, and sent to my fortunate son his
maternal uncle, Subh Karan, with Harid&#257;s Jh&#257;l&#257;, who was
one of the men in his confidence, and petitioned that if that fortunate
son would ask forgiveness for his offences and tranquillise his mind,
and obtain for him the auspicious sign-manual,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5833src" href="#xd24e5833" name="xd24e5833src">20</a> he would
himself come and wait on my son, and would send his son and successor
Karan to Court, or he, after the manner of other Rajas, would be
enrolled amongst the servants of the Court and do service. He also
begged that he himself might be excused from coming to Court on account
of his old age. Accordingly my son sent them in company with his own
Diwan Mull&#257; S&#863;hukru-llah, whom after the conclusion of this
business I dignified with the title of Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n, and
Sundar D&#257;s, his major-domo, who, after this matter was settled,
was honoured with the title of R&#257;y R&#257;y&#257;n, to the exalted
Court, and represented the circumstances. My lofty <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb274" href="#v1pb274" name=
"v1pb274">274</a>]</span>mind was always desirous, as far as possible,
not to destroy the old families. The real point was that as
R&#257;n&#257; Amar Singh and his fathers, proud in the strength of
their hilly country and their abodes, had never seen or obeyed any of
the kings of Hindustan, this should be brought about in my reign. At
the request of my son I forgave the R&#257;n&#257;&rsquo;s offences,
and gave a gracious farman that should satisfy him, and impressed on it
the mark of my auspicious palm.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5844src"
href="#xd24e5844" name="xd24e5844src">21</a> I also wrote a farman of
kindness to my son that if he could arrange to settle the matter I
should be much pleased. My son also sent them<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5850src" href="#xd24e5850" name="xd24e5850src">22</a> with
Mull&#257; S&#863;hukru-llah and Sundar D&#257;s to the R&#257;n&#257;
to console him and make him hopeful of the royal favour. They gave him
the gracious farman with the sign-manual of the auspicious hand, and it
was settled that on Sunday, the 26th of the month of Bahman, he and his
sons should come and pay their respects to my son. The second piece of
good news was the death of Bah&#257;dur, who was descended from the
rulers of Gujarat, and was the leaven of disturbance and mischief
(there). Almighty God had annihilated him in His mercy: he died of a
natural illness. The third piece of news was the defeat of the
Warz&#257; (Portuguese Viceroy), who had done his best to take the
castle and port of Surat. In the roadstead<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5856src" href="#xd24e5856" name="xd24e5856src">23</a> of the port
of Surat a fight took place between the English, who had taken shelter
there, and the Viceroy. Most of his ships were burnt by the English
fire. Being helpless he had not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb275"
href="#v1pb275" name="v1pb275">275</a>]</span>the power to fight any
more, and took to flight. He sent some one to Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n,
who was the governor of the ports of Gujarat, and knocked at the door
of peace, and said that he had come to make peace and not to make war.
It was the English who had stirred up the war. Another piece of news
was that some of the Rajputs, who had determined to attack and kill
&#703;Ambar (misprinted G&#863;h&#299;r), had made an ambush, and
finding a good opportunity had gained access to him, when a slight
wound had been inflicted on him by one of them. The men who were round
&#703;Ambar (again misprinted G&#863;h&#299;r) had killed the Rajputs
and taken &#703;Ambar to his quarters. A very little<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e5870src" href="#xd24e5870" name="xd24e5870src">24</a> more
would have made an end of him. In the end of this month, when I was
employed in hunting in the environs of Ajmir, Muh&#803;ammad
Beg,<a class="noteref" id="v1n275.2src" href="#v1n275.2" name=
"v1n275.2src">25</a> an attendant on my fortunate son Sult&#804;&#257;n
K&#863;hurram, came and brought a report from that son, and stated that
the R&#257;n&#257; had come with his sons and paid his respects to the
prince; &ldquo;the details would be made known by the report.&rdquo; I
immediately turned the face of supplication to the Divine Court, and
prostrated myself in thanksgiving. I presented a horse, an elephant,
and a jewelled dagger to the aforesaid Muh&#803;ammad Beg, and honoured
him with the title of Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#v1n275.2">25</a> From
the report it appeared that on Sunday, the 26th Bahman, the
R&#257;n&#257; paid his respects to my fortunate son with the
politeness and ritual that servants pay their respects, and produced as
offerings a famous large ruby that was in his house, with some
decorated articles and seven elephants, some of them fit for the
private stud, and which had not fallen into <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb276" href="#v1pb276" name=
"v1pb276">276</a>]</span>our hands and were the only ones left him, and
nine horses.</p>
<p class="par">My son also behaved to him with perfect kindness. When
the R&#257;n&#257; clasped his feet and asked forgiveness for his
faults, he took his head and placed it on his breast, and consoled him
in such a manner as to comfort him. He presented him with a superb
dress of honour, a jewelled sword, a horse with a jewelled saddle, and
a private elephant with silver housings, and, as there were not more
than 100 men with him who were worthy of complete robes of honour
(<i>sar u p&#257;</i>), he gave 100 sarupa and 50 horses and 12
jewelled <i>khapwa</i> (daggers). As it is the custom of the Zamindars
that the son who is the heir-apparent should not go with his father to
pay his respects to a king or prince, the R&#257;n&#257; observed this
custom, and did not bring with him Karan, the son who had received the
<i>&#7789;&#299;k&#257;</i>. As the hour (fixed by astrology) of the
departure of that son of lofty fortune from that place was the end of
that same day, he gave him leave, so that, having himself gone, he
might send Karan to pay his respects. After he had gone, Karan also
came and did so. To him also he gave a superb dress of honour, a
jewelled sword and dagger, a horse with a gold saddle, and a special
elephant, and on the same day, taking Karan in attendance, he proceeded
towards the illustrious Court. On the 3rd Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817; my
return to Ajmir from hunting took place. From the 17th Bahman up to
that date, during which I was hunting, one tigress with three cubs and
thirteen nilgaw had been killed. The fortunate prince encamped on
Saturday, the 10th of the same month, at the village of
Devr&#257;n&#299;, which is near the city of Ajmir, and an order was
given that all the Amirs should go to meet him, and that each should
present an offering according to his standing and condition, and on the
next day, Sunday, the 11th he should have the good fortune to wait upon
me. The next <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb277" href="#v1pb277"
name="v1pb277">277</a>]</span>day the prince, with great magnificence,
with all the victorious forces that had been appointed to accompany him
on that service, entered the public palace. The hour for him to wait on
me was when two watches and two gharis of the day had passed, and he
had the good fortune to pay his respects, and performed his
prostrations and salutations. He presented 1,000 ashrafis and 1,000
rupees by way of offering, 1,000 muhrs and 1,000 rupees by way of
charity. I called that son forward and embraced him, and having kissed
his head and face, favoured him with special kindnesses and greetings.
When he had finished the dues of service and had presented his
offerings and charities, he petitioned that Karan might be exalted with
the good fortune of prostrating himself and paying his respects. I
ordered them to bring him, and the Bakhshis with the usual ceremonies
of respect produced him. After prostration and salutation were
completed, at the request of my son K&#863;hurram, I ordered them to
place him in front on the right hand of the circle. After this I
ordered K&#863;hurram to go and wait on his mothers, and gave him a
special dress of honour, consisting of a jewelled <i>ch&#257;rqab</i>
(sleeveless vest), a coat of gold brocade, and a rosary of pearls.
After he had made his salutation, there were presented to him a special
dress of honour, a special horse with a jewelled saddle, and a special
elephant. I also honoured Karan with a superb robe of honour and a
jewelled sword, and the Amirs and mansabdars had the honour of
prostrating themselves and paying their respects, and presented their
offerings. Each of these, according to his service and rank, was
honoured with favours. As it was necessary to win the heart of Karan,
who was of a wild nature and had never seen assemblies and had lived
among the hills, I every day showed him some fresh favour, so that on
the second day of his attendance a jewelled dagger, and on the next day
a special Iraqi horse with jewelled saddle, were given <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb278" href="#v1pb278" name=
"v1pb278">278</a>]</span>to him. On the day when he went to the darbar
in the female apartments, there were given to him on the part of
N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam a rich dress of honour, a jewelled sword, a
horse and saddle, and an elephant. After this I presented him with a
rosary of pearls of great value. On the next day a special elephant
with trappings (<i>tal&#257;yir</i>) were given. As it was in my mind
to give him something of every kind, I presented him with three hawks
and three falcons, a special sword, a coat of mail, a special cuirass,
and two rings, one with a ruby and one with an emerald. At the end of
the month I ordered that all sorts of cloth stuffs, with carpets and
cushions (named <i>takiya</i>) and all kinds of perfumes, with vessels
of gold, two Gujrati carts, and cloths, should be placed in a hundred
trays. The Ahadis carried them in their arms and on their shoulders to
the public audience hall, where they were bestowed on him.</p>
<p class="par">S&#804;&#257;bit K&#863;h&#257;n<a class="noteref" id=

paradise-resembling assemblies was always addressing unbecoming
speeches and making palpable allusions to I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah
and his son &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n. Once or twice, showing my
dislike of this, I had forbidden him to do so, but this was not enough
for him. As I held very dear I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah&rsquo;s
good-will towards me, and was very closely connected with his family,
this matter became very irksome to me. As one night without reason and
without motive he began to speak unpleasant words to him, and said them
to such an extent that signs of vexation and annoyance became evident
in I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah&rsquo;s face, I sent him next morning,
in the custody of a servant of the Court, to &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n to say that as on the previous evening he had spoken
unpleasant words to his father I handed him over to him, and he might
shut him up either there or in the fort of Gwalior, as he pleased;
until he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb279" href="#v1pb279" name=
"v1pb279">279</a>]</span>made amends to his father I would never
forgive his fault. According to the order &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n sent him to Gwalior fort. In the same month
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n was promoted to an
increased mansab, and was given that of 2,500 personal and 2,000 horse.
Ah&#803;mad Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, who is one of the old retainers of the
State, committed some faults on the journey to the Subah of Kabul, and
Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, who was the commander of the army, had
repeatedly complained of his making himself disagreeable. Necessarily I
summoned him to Court, and in order to punish him handed him over to
Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n to confine him in the fort of
Ran&#7789;ambhor. Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of Bengal, had
sent two rubies as an offering, and they were laid before me. As I had
made a rule that they should bring before me after two watches of the
night had passed the dervishes and necessitous people who had collected
in the illustrious palace, this year also after the same manner I
bestowed on the dervishes with my own hand and in my own presence
55,000 rupees and 190,000 bighas of land, with fourteen entire
villages, and twenty-six ploughs,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5915src"

According to the Ma&#702;&#257;s&#804;ir, iii, 486, in the biography of
&#703;&#298;s&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, Rustam was sent to put down the
Tark&#863;h&#257;ns, and succeeded in doing so. See also ibid., p. 438,
in the biography of Rustam, where it is said that Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
told him to send away the Arghuns. Perhaps the passage in
Ma&#702;&#257;s&#804;ir, p. 438, which according to Blochmann, p. 314,
means that Rustam ill-treated the Arghuns, rather means that he
intrigued with them but oppressed the peasantry.&nbsp;<a class=

known as the S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam, and there is a ferry on
it of that name. The text speaks of Kot T&#299;r&#257;h as 8 kos from

<p class="par first">When 55 seconds had passed on Saturday, 1st
Farward&#299;n, in my 10th year, corresponding with the 8th<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5940src" href="#xd24e5940" name="xd24e5940src">1</a>
of the month of &#7778;afar (March, 1615), 1024 Hijra, the sun from the
constellation of Pisces entered the house of honour of Aries. When
three gharis had passed on the night of Sunday I seated myself on the
throne of State. The New Year&rsquo;s feast and ceremonials were
prepared in the usual manner. The illustrious princes, the great
K&#863;h&#257;ns, the chief officers and Ministers of State made their
salutations of congratulation. On the 1st of the month the mansab of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah was increased from 5,000 personal and 2,000
horse by 1,000 personal and horse. Special horses were given to the
Kunwar Karan, Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, and
R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo. On the 2nd the offering of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n was laid before me; it was an approved
offering of jewels and jewelled ornaments and things of gold, of cloth
stuffs of all kinds and descriptions and was looked over in detail.
That which I approved was worth 85,000 rupees. On this day a jewelled
sword with a belt and band(?) (<i>band u b&#257;r</i>) was given to
Karan, and an elephant to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n.
As I had made up my mind to proceed to the Deccan, I gave an order to
&#703;Abdu-l-Kar&#299;m Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299;, to go to Mandu and
prepare a new building for my private residence and repair the
buildings of the old kings. On the 3rd day the offerings of R&#257;ja
B&#299;r Singh Deo were laid before me and one ruby, some pearls, and
one elephant had the honour of being accepted. On the 4th day the
mansab of Mustaf&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n was increased by 500 personal
and 200 horse to 2,000 personal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb281"
href="#v1pb281" name="v1pb281">281</a>]</span>and 250 horse. On the 5th
I gave a standard and drums to I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, and an
order was given him to beat his drums. The mansab of &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n was increased by 1,000 personal and horse to 4,000
personal and 2,000 horse, and having increased the mansab of R&#257;ja
B&#299;r Singh Deo by 700 horse, I dismissed him to his own country,
directing that he should present himself at Court at stated periods. On
the same day the offering of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n was laid
before me. Some of all the kinds of things pleased me. Kishan Chand, of
the sons of the Rajas of Nagarkot, was honoured with the title of Raja.
On Thursday, the 6th, the offerings of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah were
laid before me at Chas&#863;hma-i-N&#363;r; a large meeting had been
arranged, and by way of favour the whole of his offerings were
inspected. Of the jewels and jewelled things and choice cloth stuffs
the value of 100,000 rupees was accepted, and the remainder given back.
On the 7th day I increased by 1,000 personal the mansab of Kishan
Singh, which had been 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse. On this day a
tiger was killed in the neighbourhood of Chas&#863;hma-i-N&#363;r. On
the 8th I gave Karan the mansab of 5,000 personal and horse, and gave
him a small rosary of pearls and emeralds with a ruby in the centre
which in the language of the Hindus is called <i>smaran</i> (Sanskrit
for &lsquo;remembrance&rsquo;). I increased the mansab of
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n by 1,000 personal and 400 horse, so
as to make it 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, original and increase.
The mansab of H&#803;&#257;j&#299; B&#299; &#362;zbeg was increased by
300 horse, and that of R&#257;ja S&#863;hy&#257;m Singh by 500 personal
so as to make it 2,500 personal and 1,400 horse. On Sunday, the 9th,
there was an eclipse of the sun when twelve gharis of the day had
passed. It began from the west, and four out of five parts of the sun
were eclipsed in the knot of the dragon. From the commencement of the
seizure until it became light eight gharis elapsed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb282" href="#v1pb282" name=
"v1pb282">282</a>]</span>Alms of all kinds, and things in the shape of
metals, animals, and vegetables, were given to fakirs and the poor and
people in need. On this day the offering of R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh
was laid before me; what was taken was of the value of 43,000 rupees.
The offering of Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of Qandahar,
was also laid before me on this day; its total value came to 14,000
rupees. Two watches of the night had passed on the night of Monday, the
29th &#7778;afar (30th March, 1615), in the ascension of Sagittarius,
when a boy was born to B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram by the daughter of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n; I gave him the name of D&#257;r&#257;
S&#863;huk&#363;h. I hope that his coming will be propitious to this
State conjoined with eternity, and to his fortunate father. The mansab
of Sayyid &#703;Al&#299; B&#257;rha was increased by 500 personal and
300 horse, so as to bring it to 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. On the
10th the offering of I&#703;tib&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n was laid before
me, and what was of the value of 40,000 rupees was accepted. On this
day the mansab of K&#863;husrau B&#299; &#362;zbeg was raised by 300
horse, and that of Mangl&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n by 500 personal and 200
horse. On the 11th the offering of Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n
was laid before me. Of it seven rubies, one rosary of pearls, and 270
other pearls were accepted, and their value was 145,000 rupees. On the
12th the offerings of M&#299;rz&#257; R&#257;ja Bh&#257;o Singh and
R&#257;wat S&#863;hankar were laid before me. On the 13th, out of the
offering of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan, one
<i>qutb&#299;</i> (Egyptian?) ruby, one diamond, one string of pearls,
five rings, four pearls, and some cloths, altogether the value of
32,000 rupees, were accepted. On the 14th the mansab of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan, which was 3,000 personal and
700 horse, was increased by 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and that of
Waf&#257;d&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, of 750 personal and 200 horse, by
2,000 personal and 1,200 horse. On the same day Mustaf&#257; Beg, the
ambassador of the ruler of Iran, had the good fortune to wait upon me.
After <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb283" href="#v1pb283" name=
"v1pb283">283</a>]</span>completing the matter of Gurjistan (Georgia),
my exalted brother sent him with a letter consisting of expressions of
friendship and assurances of sincerity, with several horses, camels,
and some stuffs from Aleppo, which had come for that fortunate brother
from the direction of R&#363;m. Nine large European hunting dogs, for
which a request had gone, were also sent by him.</p>
<p class="par">Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, on this day,
obtained leave to go for the capture of the fort of K&#257;ngra, the
equal of which for strength they cannot point to in the hill country of
the Panjab or even all the habitable world. From the time when the
sound of Islam reached the country of Hindustan up to this auspicious
time when the throne of rule has been adorned by this suppliant at the
throne of Allah, none of the rulers or kings has obtained possession of
it. Once in the time of my revered father, the army of the Panjab was
sent against this fort, and besieged it for a long time. At length they
came to the conclusion that the fort was not to be taken, and the army
was sent off to some more necessary business. When he was dismissed, I
gave Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n a private elephant with
trappings. R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Mal, son of R&#257;ja B&#257;so, as his
country was near that fort, was also appointed, and his previous mansab
was increased by 500 personal and horse. R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh
also came from his place and jagir and waited on me, and presented an
offering of 100 ashrafis. On the 17th the offering of M&#299;rz&#257;
Rustam was laid before me. Two jewelled daggers, one rosary of pearls,
some pieces of cloth, an elephant, and four Iraq horses were accepted,
and the rest returned; their value was 15,000 rupees. On the same date
the offering of I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n, of the value of
18,000 rupees, was laid before me. On the 18th the offering of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n was inspected. Of jewels
and cloth stuffs the value of 15,000 rupees was accepted. The mansab of
I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n, which was 700 personal and 200
horse, I increased <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb284" href=
"#v1pb284" name="v1pb284">284</a>]</span>by 800 personal and 300 horse,
so that with original and increase it came to 1,500 personal and 500
horse. K&#863;husrau B&#299; &#362;zbeg, who was one of the
distinguished soldiers, died of the disease of dysentery. On the 8th
day, which was Thursday, after two watches and four and a half gharis
had passed, the <i>s&#863;haraf</i> (highest point of the sun&rsquo;s
ascension) began. On this auspicious day I ascended the throne in
happiness and prosperity, and the people saluted and congratulated me.
When one watch of the day remained I went to the
Chas&#863;hma-i-N&#363;r. According to agreement the offering of
Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n was laid before me at that place. He had
arranged beautiful jewels and jewellery, with cloth stuff and articles
of all kinds that were pleasing to me. Among these, a jewelled khapwa
(dagger), which at his request the royal artificers had made, and the
like of which in value there did not exist in my private treasury, was
worth 100,000 rupees. In addition to this, jewels and other things of
the value of 138,000 rupees were taken. Indeed, it was a splendid
offering. To Mu&#7779;t&#804;af&#257; Beg, the ambassador of the ruler
of Iran, I gave 20,000 <i>darab</i>, or 10,000 rupees. On the 21st I
sent robes of honour by the hand of &#703;Abdu-l-G&#863;haf&#363;r to
fifteen of the Amirs of the Deccan. R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t
obtained leave to go to his jagir, and a special shawl (<i>parm
narm</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e5983src" href="#xd24e5983" name=
"xd24e5983src">2</a>) was given to him. On the same day I gave a
jewelled waist-dagger to Mu&#7779;t&#804;af&#257; Beg, the ambassador.
I increased the mansab of H&#363;shang, the son of Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, which was 1,000 personal and 500 horse, by 500
personal and 200 horse. On the 23rd, Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n
was promoted to the Subah of Behar. Zafar K&#863;h&#257;n was ordered
to present himself at Court. To the mansab of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, which was 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, I added 500
personal and 1,000 horse. Saif K&#863;h&#257;n on the same day was
dismissed to his jagir, as well as <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb285" href="#v1pb285" name=
"v1pb285">285</a>]</span>H&#803;&#257;j&#299; B&#299; &#362;zbeg, who
was honoured with the title of &#362;zbeg K&#863;h&#257;n.
Bah&#257;duru-l-mulk, who belonged to the army of the Deccan and held
the mansab of 2,500 personal and 2,100 horse received an increase of
500 personal and 200 horse. An increase of 200 was made in the mansab
of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Taq&#299;, which was 800 personal and 180 horse.
On the 25th an increase of 200 horse was made in the rank of
Sal&#257;mu-llah, the Arab, so that it became 1,500 personal and 1,000
horse. I presented Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n with the black piebald
horse out of my special horses which the ruler of Iran had sent me. At
the end of the day of Thursday I went to the house of B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram and remained there till a watch of the night had passed.
His second offering was laid before me on that day. On the first day he
paid his respects he laid before me a celebrated ruby of the
R&#257;n&#257;, which, on the day of his paying his respects, he had
made an offering of to my son, and which the jewellers valued at 60,000
rupees. It was not worthy of the praise they had given it. The weight
of this ruby was eight <i>t&#257;nk</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5995src" href="#xd24e5995" name="xd24e5995src">3</a> and it was
formerly in the possession of R&#257;y Maldeo, who was the chief of the
tribe of the R&#257;&#7789;hors and one of the chief rulers (or Rays)
of Hindustan. From him it was transferred to his son Chandar Sen, who,
in the days of his wretchedness and hopelessness, sold it to
R&#257;n&#257; &#362;day Singh. From him it went to R&#257;n&#257;
Part&#257;p, and afterwards to this R&#257;n&#257; Amar Singh. As they
had no more valuable gift in their family, he presented it on the day
that he paid his respects to my fortunate son B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram, together with the whole of his stud of elephants, which,
according to the Indian idiom, they call <i>gheta
ch&#257;r.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e6000src" href="#xd24e6000"
name="xd24e6000src">4</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb286" href=
"#v1pb286" name="v1pb286">286</a>]</span>I ordered them to engrave on
the ruby that at the time of paying his respects R&#257;n&#257; Amar
Singh had presented it as an offering to Sult&#257;n K&#863;hurram. On
that day certain other things from among the offerings of
B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram were accepted. Among them was a little
crystal box of Frank work, made with great taste, with some emeralds,
three rings, four Iraq horses, and various other things, the value of
which was 80,000 rupees. On the day on which I went to his house he had
prepared a great offering, in fact there were laid before me things and
rarities worth about four or five lakhs of rupees. Of these the
equivalent of 100,000 rupees was taken away and the balance given to
him.</p>
<p class="par">On the 28th the mansab of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n,
which was 3,000 personal and 1,800 horse, was increased by 500 personal
and 400 horse. In the end of the month I presented Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
K&#863;h&#257;n with a horse, a robe of honour, a jewelled dagger, a
standard and drums, and dismissed him to the province of Behar. The
office of <i>&#703;arz&#803;-mukarrir</i> (reviser of petitions), that
belonged to K&#863;hw&#257;jag&#299; H&#803;&#257;j&#299; Muhammad, as
he had died, I gave to Muk&#863;hli&#7779; K&#863;h&#257;n, who was in
my confidence. Three hundred horse were increased in the mansab of
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n, who now had 1,000 personal and horse. As
the hour of the leave-taking of Kunwar Karan was at hand, I was
desirous of showing him my skill in shooting with a gun. Just at this
time the <i>qar&#257;wul&#257;n</i> (shikaris) brought in news of a
tigress. Though it is an established custom of mine only to hunt male
tigers, yet, in consideration that no other tiger might be obtained
before his departure, I went for the tigress. I took with me Karan, and
said to him that I would hit it wherever he wished me to do so. After
this arrangement I went to the place where they had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb287" href="#v1pb287" name=
"v1pb287">287</a>]</span>marked down the tiger. By chance there was a
wind and disturbance in the air, and the female elephant on which I was
mounted was terrified of the tigress and would not stand still.
Notwithstanding these two great obstacles to shooting, I shot straight
towards her eye. God Almighty did not allow me to be ashamed before
that prince, and, as I had agreed, I shot her in the eye. On the same
day Karan petitioned me for a special gun, and I gave him a special
Turkish one.</p>
<p class="par">As on the day for his departure I had not given
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n an elephant, I now gave him a special
elephant, and I also sent an elephant to Bah&#257;duru-l-mulk and one
to Waf&#257;d&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 8th Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht
the assemblage for my lunar weighing was held, and I weighed myself
against silver and other things, distributing them amongst the
deserving and needy. Naw&#257;zis&#863;h K&#863;h&#257;n took leave to
go to his jagir, which was in Malwa. On the same day I gave an elephant
to K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan. On the 9th they brought
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, who had come to Agra from the fort of
Gwalior, and who had been sent for. Though he had been guilty of many
offences, and in all that I had done to him I was right, yet when they
brought him into my presence and my eye fell on him, I perceived more
shame in myself than in him. Having pardoned all his offences, I gave
him the shawl I had round my waist. I gave Kunwar Karan 100,000
<i>darab</i>. On the same day R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh brought a
large elephant of the name of Ran-r&#257;wat, which was a celebrated
elephant of his, as an offering. In fact, it was such a rare elephant
that I put it into my private stud. On the 10th the offering of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, which he sent me from Agra by the hand of
his son, was laid before me. It was of all kinds of things, of the
value of 40,000 rupees. On the 12th the offering of K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n, which consisted of forty-five<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6050src" href="#xd24e6050" name="xd24e6050src">5</a> horse
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb288" href="#v1pb288" name=
"v1pb288">288</a>]</span>two strings of camels, Arabian dogs
(greyhounds), and hunting animals (hawks?), was brought before me. On
the same day seven other elephants from R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh were
also brought to me as an offering, and were placed in my private stud.
Tah&#803;ayyur K&#863;h&#257;n, after he had been in attendance on me
for four months, to-day got leave to go. A message was sent to
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n. I impressed on him the profit and loss
of friendship and enmity, and made an agreement (with Tah&#803;ayyur
K&#863;h&#257;n) that all these words should be repeated to
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, and he should bring him back to the
path of loyalty and obedience. At the time of his taking leave I also
bestowed on him certain things. On the whole, in this short time, what
with the gifts bestowed on him by me privately, by the princes, and
those given him by the Amirs according to order, the account mounted up
to about 100,000 rupees that he had received. On the 14th the rank and
reward of my son K&#863;hurram were fixed. His mansab had been one of
12,000 personal and 6,000 horse, and that of his brother (Parw&#299;z)
15,000 personal and 8,000 horse. I ordered his mansab to be made equal
with that of Parw&#299;z, besides other rewards. I gave him a private
elephant of the name of Panch&#299; Gaj,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6063src" href="#xd24e6063" name="xd24e6063src">6</a> with
accoutrements of the value of 12,000 rupees. On the 16th an elephant
was given to Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 17th the mansab of
R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh, which was 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse,
was increased by 1,000, and it was raised to 5,000. At the request of
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n the mansab of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
&#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f, which was 500 personal and 200 horse,
was raised by 200, and it was ordered to be 1,000 personal and 400
horse. &#703;Abdu-llah, the son of K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am,
who was imprisoned in the fort of Ran&#7789;ambhor, was sent for at the
request of his father. He came to the Court, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb289" href="#v1pb289" name=
"v1pb289">289</a>]</span>I took the chains off his legs and sent him to
his father&rsquo;s house. On the 24th, R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh
presented me with another elephant, called Fauj-sang&#257;r
(&lsquo;ornament of the army&rsquo;), by way of offering. Although this
is also a good elephant, and has been placed in my private stud, it is
not to be compared with the first elephant (he sent), which is one of
the wonders of the age, and is worth 20,000 rupees. On the 26th, 200
personal were added to the mansab of Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, son
of M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h; it was 700 personal and
500 horse. On the same day K&#863;hw&#257;ja Zainu-d-d&#299;n, who is
of the Naqs&#863;hband&#299; K&#863;hw&#257;jas, came from
M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr and waited on me, bringing as an
offering eighteen horses. Qizilb&#257;s&#863;h K&#863;h&#257;n, who was
one of the auxiliaries of the province of Gujarat, had come to Court
without the leave of the governor. I ordered that an ahadi should put
him into confinement, and that he be sent back to the governor of
Gujarat, so that others might not desire to do the same. The mansab of
Mub&#257;rak K&#863;h&#257;n Saz&#257;wal I raised 500 personal, so
that it should be 1,500 personal and 700 horse. On the 29th I gave
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am 100,000 rupees, and ordered that the
parganahs of D&#257;sna<a class="noteref" id="v1n300.1src" href=
"#v1n300.1" name="v1n300.1src">7</a> and K&#257;sna,<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#v1n300.1">7</a> which are equivalent to 5,000
personal, should be made his jagir. At the end of the same month I gave
leave to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, with his
brothers and other relatives, to go to Allahabad, which had been
appropriated to them as jagir. At this meeting twenty horse, a
<i>qab&#257;</i> (<i>parm narm</i>) of Cashmere cloth, twelve deer, and
ten Arabian dogs were given to Karan. The next day, which was the 1st
K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d, forty horse, the next day forty-one horse, and
the third day twenty, amounting in the space of three days to 101 head,
were given as a present to Kunwar Karan. In return for the elephant
Fauj-sang&#257;r, an elephant worth 10,000 rupees out of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb290" href="#v1pb290" name=
"v1pb290">290</a>]</span>my private stud was presented to R&#257;ja
S&#363;raj Singh. On the 5th of the month ten turbans
(<i>ch&#299;ra</i>), ten coats (<i>qaba</i>), and ten waist-bands were
given to Karan. On the 20th I gave him another elephant.</p>
<p class="par">In these days the news-writer of Kashmir had written
that a Mull&#257; of the name of Gad&#257;&#702;&#299;, a disciplined
dervish, who for forty years had lived in one of the monasteries of the
city, had prayed the inheritors of that monastery two years<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6095src" href="#xd24e6095" name="xd24e6095src">8</a>
before he was to deliver over the pledge of his life that he might
select a corner in that monastery as a place for his burial. They said,
&ldquo;Let it be so.&rdquo; In short, he selected a place. When the
time for his delivery came he informed his friends and relations and
those who were dear to him that an order had reached him that,
delivering over the pledge (of life) he had, he should turn towards the
last world. Those who were present wondered at his words, and said that
the prophets had no such information, and how could they believe such
words? He said, &ldquo;Such an order has been given to me.&rdquo; He
then turned to one of his confidants, who was of the sons of the
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299;s of the country, and said: &ldquo;You will expend
the price<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6098src" href="#xd24e6098" name=
"xd24e6098src">9</a> of my Koran, which is worth 700 tankas, in
carrying me (to the grave). When you hear the call to Friday&rsquo;s
prayer you will enquire for me.&rdquo; This conversation took place on
the Thursday, and he divided all the goods in his room among his
acquaintance and disciples, and went, and at end of the day bathed at
the baths. The Q&#257;z&#803;&#299;-z&#257;da aforesaid came before the
call for prayer, and enquired as to the health of the Mull&#257;. When
he came to the door of the cell <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb291"
href="#v1pb291" name="v1pb291">291</a>]</span>he found the door closed
and a servant sitting there. He asked the slave what had happened, and
the servant said, &ldquo;The Mull&#257; has enjoined me that until the
door of the cell open of its own accord I must not go in.&rdquo;
Shortly after these words were said the door of the cell opened. The
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299;-z&#257;da entered the cell with that servant and
saw that the Mull&#257; was on his knees with his face turned toward
the qibla, and had given up his soul to God. Happy the state of the
freed who can fly away from this place of the snares of dependence with
such ease!</p>
<p class="par">By the increase of 200 personal and 50 horse in the
mansab of Karam Sen R&#257;&#7789;hor, I raised it to 1,000 personal
and 300 horse. On the 11th of this month the offering of Las&#863;hkar
K&#863;h&#257;n, which consisted of three strings of Persian camels and
twenty cups and plates from K&#863;hit&#804;&#257; (China) and twenty
Arabian dogs, was brought before me. On the 12th a jewelled dagger was
bestowed on I&#703;tib&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, and to Karan I gave a
plume (<i>kalg&#299;</i>) worth 2,000 rupees. On the 14th I gave a
dress of honour to Sar-<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6108src" href=
"#xd24e6108" name="xd24e6108src">10</a>buland R&#257;y, and gave him
leave to go to the Deccan.</p>
<p class="par">On the night of Friday, the 15th, a strange affair
occurred. By chance on that night I was at Pushkar. To be brief,
Kis&#863;han, own brother to R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh, was in great
perturbation through Gobind D&#257;s, the Vakil of the said Raja having
some time ago killed his nephew, a youth of the name of Gop&#257;l
D&#257;s. The cause of the quarrel it would take too long to tell.
Kis&#863;han Singh expected that, as Gop&#257;l D&#257;s was also the
nephew of the Raja (S&#363;raj Singh), the latter would kill Gobind
D&#257;s. But the Raja, on account of the experience and ability of
Gobind D&#257;s, relinquished the idea of seeking revenge for his
nephew&rsquo;s death. When Kis&#863;han saw this neglect on the part of
the Raja, he resolved himself to take <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb292" href="#v1pb292" name="v1pb292">292</a>]</span>revenge for his
nephew, and not allow his blood to pass away unnoticed. For a long time
he kept this matter in his mind, until on that night he assembled his
brothers, friends, and servants, and told them that he would go that
night to take Gobind D&#257;s&rsquo;s life, whatever might happen, and
that he did not care what injury might happen to the Raja. The Raja was
in ignorance of what was happening, and when it was near dawn
Kis&#863;han came with Karan, his brother&rsquo;s son, and other
companions. When he arrived at the gate of the Raja&rsquo;s dwelling he
sent some of the experienced men on foot to the house of Gobind
D&#257;s, which was near the Raja&rsquo;s. He himself (Kis&#863;han)
was on horseback, and stationed himself near the gate. The men on foot
entered Gobind D&#257;s&rsquo;s house, and killed some of those who
were there on guard. Whilst this fight was going on Gobind D&#257;s
awoke, and seizing his sword in a state of bewilderment was coming out
from one side of the house to join the outside watchmen. When the men
on foot had finished killing some of the people, they came out of the
tent to endeavour to find out Gobind D&#257;s, and, meeting him, they
finished his affair (killed him). Before the news of the killing of
Gobind D&#257;s reached Kis&#863;han, he, unable to bear it any more,
dismounted and came inside the dwelling. Although his men protested in
a disturbed state that it was not right to be on foot, he would in no
way listen to them. If he had remained a little longer and the news of
his enemy having been killed had reached him, it is possible that he
would have escaped safe and sound, mounted as he was. As the pen of
destiny had gone forth after another fashion, as soon as he alighted
and went in, the Raja, who was in his <i>mah&#803;all</i> (female
apartment), awoke at the uproar among the people, and stood at the gate
of his house with his sword drawn. People from all sides were aroused
and came in against the men who were on foot. They saw what the number
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb293" href="#v1pb293" name=
"v1pb293">293</a>]</span>of men on foot was, and came out in great
numbers and faced Kis&#863;han Singh&rsquo;s men, who were about ten in
number. In short, Kis&#863;han Singh and his nephew Karan, when they
reached the Raja&rsquo;s house, were attacked by these men and both of
them killed. Kis&#863;han Singh had seven and Karan nine wounds.
Altogether in this fight 66 men on the two sides were killed, on the
Raja&rsquo;s side 30 and on Kis&#863;han Singh&rsquo;s 36. When the sun
rose and illumined the world with its light, this business was
revealed, and the Raja saw that his brother, his nephew, and some of
his servants, whom he considered dearer than himself, were killed, and
the whole of the rest had dispersed to their own places. The news
reached me in Pushkar, and I ordered them to burn those who were
killed, according to their rites, and inform me of the true
circumstances of the affair. In the end it became clear that the affair
had happened in the manner in which it has been written here, and that
no further enquiry was necessary.</p>
<p class="par">On the 8th M&#299;r&#257;n &#7778;adr Jah&#257;n came
from his native place and waited on me with an offering of 100 muhrs.
R&#257;y S&#363;raj Singh was dismissed to his duty in the Deccan. I
presented him with a couple of pearls for his ears and a special
Kashmir shawl (<i>parm narm</i>). A pair of pearls were also sent to
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n. On the 25th I increased the mansab of
I&#703;tib&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n by 600 horse, so as to bring it to
5,000 personal and 2,000 horse. On the same day Karan obtained leave to
go to his jagir. He received a present of a horse, a special elephant,
a dress of honour, a string of pearls of the value of 50,000 rupees,
and a jewelled dagger which had been completed for 2,000 rupees. From
the time of his waiting on me till he obtained leave, what he had had
in the shape of cash, jewellery, jewels, and jewelled things was of the
value of 200,000 rupees, with 110 horses, five elephants, in addition
to what my son K&#863;hurram bestowed on him <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb294" href="#v1pb294" name=
"v1pb294">294</a>]</span>at various times. I gave Mub&#257;rak
K&#863;h&#257;n Saz&#257;wal a horse and an elephant, and appointed him
to accompany him. I sent several verbal messages to the R&#257;n&#257;.
R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh also obtained leave to go to his native
country, with a promise to return in two months. On the 27th,
P&#257;yanda K&#863;h&#257;n Mog&#863;hul,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6133src" href="#xd24e6133" name="xd24e6133src">11</a> who was one
of the old Amirs of the State, gave up the deposit of his life.</p>
<p class="par">At the end of this month news came that the ruler of
Iran had executed his eldest son &#7778;af&#299; M&#299;rz&#257;. This
was a cause of great bewilderment. When I enquired into it they said
that at Daras&#863;h,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6138src" href=
"#xd24e6138" name="xd24e6138src">12</a> which is one of the noted
cities of G&#299;l&#257;n, he ordered a slave of the name of
Bihb&#363;d to kill &#7778;af&#299; M&#299;rz&#257;. The slave found an
opportunity, early in the morning on the 5th of Muh&#803;arram, in the
year 1024 (25th January, 1615), when the M&#299;rz&#257; was returning
from the baths towards his house, and finished his affair for him with
two wounds from a sword (<i>s&#299;k&#863;hak&#299;</i>).<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6144src" href="#xd24e6144" name=
"xd24e6144src">13</a> After a great part of the day had passed, while
his body lay between the water and the mud, S&#863;haik&#863;h
Bah&#257;&#702;u-d-d&#299;n Muh&#803;ammad, who was the best known man
in the country for learning and holiness, and on whom the Shah had full
reliance, reported the affair, and, obtaining leave to lift him up,
took his corpse and sent it to Ardab&#299;l, where was the
burial-ground of his ancestors. Although much enquiry was made of
travellers from Iran, no one would say a word of this affair that
satisfied my mind with regard to it. The killing of a son must have
some powerful motive in order to do away with the disgrace of it.

<p class="par">On the 1st of the month of T&#299;r I gave an elephant
of the name of Ranj&#299;t with its trappings to M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam
and another to Sayyid Al&#299; B&#257;rha. M&#299;rak H&#803;usain, a
relation of K&#863;hw&#257;ja S&#863;hamsu-d-d&#299;n, was appointed
bakhshi and news-writer of the Subah of Behar, and took leave to go. I
gave K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f
Q&#363;s&#863;h-beg&#299; (the falconer) an elephant and a dress of
honour, and dismissed him to his jagir. On the 9th of the same month I
gave a jewelled sword to K&#863;h&#257;n Dauran, and a jewelled dagger
was sent for Allahd&#257;d, the son of Jal&#257;l&#257; the Afghan, who
had become loyal. On the 13th took place the meeting for the festival
of the <i>&#256;b-p&#257;s&#863;h&#257;n</i><a class="noteref" id=

scattering), and the servants of the Court amused themselves with
sprinkling rose-water over each other. On the 17th, Am&#257;nat
K&#863;h&#257;n was appointed to the port of Cambay. As Muqarrab
K&#863;h&#257;n proposed to come to Court, the (charge of the)
aforesaid port was changed. On the same day I sent a jewelled
waist-dagger to my son Parw&#299;z. On the 18th the offering of
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n was laid before me. He had
prepared all kinds of jewellery and other things, jewels with jewelled
things, such as three rubies and 103 pearls, 100 rubies
(<i>y&#257;q&#363;t</i>), two jewelled daggers and an aigrette adorned
with rubies and pearls, a jewelled water-jar, a jewelled sword, a
quiver bound with velvet, and a diamond ring, altogether of the value
of about 100,000 rupees, in addition to jewels and jewelled things,
cloth from the Deccan and Carnatic, and all kinds of gilt and plain
things, with fifteen elephants and a horse whose mane reached the
ground. The offering of S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n (his
son) also, consisting of five elephants, 300 pieces of all kinds of
cloth, was brought before me. On the 8th I honoured H&#363;s&#863;hang
with the title of Ikr&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n. R&#363;z-afz&#363;n, who
was one of the princes of the Subah of Behar and who had <span class=

Sangr&#257;m.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6163src" href="#xd24e6163"
name="xd24e6163src">15</a> Though the latter had been killed in
opposing the leaders of the State, I gave him an elephant and leave to
go to his native place. An elephant was presented to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 24th, Jagat Singh, son of Kunwar
Karan, who was in his 12th year, came and waited on me, and presented
petitions from his grandfather, the R&#257;n&#257; Amar Singh, and from
his father. The signs of nobility and high birth were evident on his
face. I pleased him with a dress of honour and kindness. To the mansab
of M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;&#298;s&#257; Tark&#863;h&#257;n an addition
of 200 personal was made, so that it attained to 1,200 personal and 300
horse. In the end of the month, having honoured S&#863;haik&#863;h
H&#803;usain Roh&#299;la with the title of Mub&#257;riz
K&#863;h&#257;n, I dismissed him to his jagir. Ten thousand darabs
(5,000 rupees) were given to the relations of M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;harafu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain K&#257;s&#863;hg&#863;har&#299;,
who at this time had come and had the honour of kissing the threshold.
On the 5th Amurd&#257;d, to the mansab of R&#257;ja Nathmal, which was
1,500 personal and 1,100 horse, an addition of 500 personal and 100
horse was made. On the 7th, Kes&#863;ho (D&#257;s) M&#257;r&#363;, who
had a jagir in the Sarkar of Orissa, and who had been sent for to Court
on account of a complaint<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6166src" href=
"#xd24e6166" name="xd24e6166src">16</a> against the governor of the
Subah of that place, came and paid his respects. He produced as an
offering four elephants. As I had a great desire to see my
<i>farzand</i> (son) K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n (Lod&#299;), and for
the purpose of enquiring into important matters connected with the
Deccan, it was necessary for him to come at once, I sent for him. On
Tuesday, the 8th of the same <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb297"

pearls, 1 emerald, and a jewelled <i>ph&#363;l ka&#7789;&#257;ra</i>,
the total value being 50,000 rupees. On the night of Sunday, as it was
the anniversary of the great K&#863;hw&#257;ja
(Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n), I went to his revered mausoleum, and
remained there till midnight. The attendants and Sufis exhibited
ecstatic states, and I gave the fakirs and attendants money with my own
hand; altogether there were expended 6,000 rupees in cash, 100
<i>s&#804;aub-kurta</i> (a robe down to the ankles), 70 rosaries of
pearls,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6183src" href="#xd24e6183" name=

private stable and another horse were presented to Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 19th an elephant was given to K&#863;h&#257;n
A&#703;z&#804;am. On the 20th, 200 horse were added to the mansab of

of 200 personal and horse was made to the mansab of K&#863;hw&#257;ja

Mirz&#257; R&#257;ja Bh&#257;o Singh took leave to go to Amber, which
was his ancient native place, and had given him a special Kashmir

corresponding with the <i>S&#863;hab-i-bar&#257;t</i> (consecrated to
the memory of forefathers), I ordered them to light lamps on the hills
round the &#256;n&#257; S&#257;gar tank and on its banks, and went
myself to look at them. The reflection of the lamps fell on the water

having received a dress of honour, an elephant, and a horse, started
off. As R&#257;ja R&#257;j Singh Kachhw&#257;ha had died in the Deccan,

On the same date I released R&#257;ja M&#257;n, who was in confinement
in the fort of Gwalior, on the security of Murtaz&#803;&#257;

increased his mansab by 300 horse, so as to make it 5,000 personal and
3,300 horse; he received a dress of honour and a horse, and started. On
the 18th I confirmed the mansab of M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;&#298;s&#257;,
original and increase, at 1,500 personal and 800 horse, and gave him an

Ch&#299;n Qil&#299;j was received by a letter from Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n. After the death of Qil&#299;j
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of the old servants of this State, I had
made this inauspicious man an Am&#299;r, and shown him great favour,
and given him in jagir such a place as Jaunpur. I also sent his other
brothers and relations with him and made them his deputies. He had one
brother of the name of Lahor&#299;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6245src"
href="#xd24e6245" name="xd24e6245src">22</a> of a very wicked
disposition. It was reported to me that the servants of God (people)
were greatly oppressed by his conduct. I sent an ahadi to bring him
(Lahor&#299;) from Jaunpur. At the coming of the ahadi, suspicion
without any cause prevailed over Ch&#299;n Qil&#299;j, and it came into
his mind to run away, taking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb302"
href="#v1pb302" name="v1pb302">302</a>]</span>his misguided brother
with him. Leaving his mansab, his government, place, and jagir, money,
property, children, and people, he took a little money and gold and a
few jewels and went with a small body among the zamindars. This news
arrived a few days ago and caused great astonishment. In short, to
whatever zamindar he went he took money<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6250src" href="#xd24e6250" name="xd24e6250src">23</a> from him(?)
and then let him go(?), until news came that he had entered the country
of Johat.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6253src" href="#xd24e6253" name=
"xd24e6253src">24</a> When this news reached Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, he sent some of his men to take and bring
that thoughtless one. They took him as soon as they arrived, and were
intending to take him to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n,
when he at that very moment went to hell. Some of those who had
accompanied him said that for some days previously he had contracted an
illness and it had killed him. But this was heard of him as well, that
he committed suicide, in order that they might not take him to
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n in this state. In any
case, they brought his body with his children and servants who were
with him to Allahabad. They made away with most of the money that he
had, and the zamindars took it from him. Alas, that salt (i.e. loyalty)
should not have brought such black-faced wretches to condign
punishment!</p>

Bangas&#863;h, which brought it to 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse; 100

his previous services, I promoted him to be Subadar of Kashmir, and
confirmed his mansab of 2,500 personal and 1,500 horse, honoured him
with a jewelled waist-dagger and a dress of honour, and gave him leave.
By the hand of Ihtim&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n I sent winter dresses of
honour to Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of Bengal, and the Amirs
that were attached to that province. On the 15th of the month there was
laid before me the offering of Maka&#702;&#299;, son of
Iftik&#863;h&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, consisting of an elephant,

with the title of Muruwwat K&#863;h&#257;n. At the request of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula, I had sent for Day&#257;nat
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was in the fort of Gwalior, and he had the good
fortune to pay his respects; his property, which had been confiscated,
was restored to him.</p>

<p class="par">On the 20th, M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n came and waited on
me. A summary of his circumstances and of his family is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb305" href="#v1pb305" name=

father<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6334src" href="#xd24e6334" name=

M&#299;r&#257;n, son of S&#863;h&#257;h Ni&#703;matu-llah Wal&#299;.
During the reigns of the &#7778;afaw&#299; kings the family had
attained to great respect, so that S&#863;h&#257;h T&#804;ahm&#257;sp
gave his own sister J&#257;nish<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6337src"

S&#863;h&#257;h Ni&#703;matu-llah, and so on account of his being a
great Shaikh and of his being an instructor he was made a relative and
a son-in-law (of kings). On the side of his mother he was the
daughter&rsquo;s son of S&#863;h&#257;h Isma&#703;&#299;l
K&#863;h&#363;n&#299; (Isma&#703;&#299;l II, the Bloody). After the
death of S&#863;h&#257;h Ni&#703;matu-llah, his son
G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n Muh&#803;ammad M&#299;r
M&#299;r&#257;n received great consideration, and the late
S&#863;h&#257;h (T&#804;ahm&#257;sp) gave to his eldest son in marriage
a daughter from the royal family. He gave the daughter of the
above-mentioned S&#863;h&#257;h Isma&#703;&#299;l to another son of
his, K&#863;hal&#299;lu-llah, to whom M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n was
born. The aforesaid M&#299;r K&#863;hal&#299;lu-llah, seven or eight
years before this, had come from Persia and waited on me at Lahore. As
he belonged to a high and saintly family, I was much interested in his
affairs, and gave him a mansab and a jagir, and honoured and cherished
him. After the seat of government was at Agra, in a short time he was
attacked by bilious<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6340src" href=
"#xd24e6340" name="xd24e6340src">31</a> diarrh&oelig;a from eating too
many mangoes, and in ten or twelve days gave up his soul to the
Creator. I was grieved at his going, and ordered what he had left in
cash and jewels to be sent to his children in Persia. Meanwhile
M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n, who was 22 years old, became a qalandar and
dervish, and came to me at Ajmir in a way that nobody on the road could
recognize him. I soothed all the troubles of his mind and the miseries
of his inward and outward condition, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb306" href="#v1pb306" name="v1pb306">306</a>]</span>and gave him a
mansab of 1,000 personal and 400 horse, and presented him with 30,000
darabs in cash. He is now in waiting and attendance on me.</p>
<p class="par">On the 12th, Z&#804;afar K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been
removed from the Subah of Behar, came and waited on me, and made an
offering of 100 muhrs, as well as three elephants. On the 15th of Day I
increased the mansab of Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n, the Subahdar of
Bengal, by 1,000 personal and horse, so as to make it 4,000 personal
and horse. As the diwan and bakhshi of Bengal, H&#803;usain Beg and
T&#804;&#257;hir, had not done approved service, Muk&#863;hli&#7779;
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of the confidential servants of the Court,
was nominated to these duties. I conferred on him a mansab of 2,000
personal and 700 horse, and also gave him a standard. The duty of
<i>&#703;arz&#803;-mukarrir</i> (reviser of petitions) I ordered to be
given to Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 25th, Friday, the
weighing of my son K&#863;hurram took place. Up to the present year,
when he is 24 years old, and is married and has children, he has never
defiled himself with drinking wine. On this day, when the assembly for
his weighing was held, I said to him: &ldquo;B&#257;b&#257;, thou hast
become the father of children, and kings and kings&rsquo; sons have
drunk wine. To-day, which is the day of thy being weighed, I will give
thee wine to drink, and give thee leave to drink it on feast days and
at the time of the New Year, and at all great festivals. But thou must
observe the path of moderation, for wise men do not consider it right
to drink to such an extent as to destroy the understanding, and it is
necessary that from drinking only profit should be derived.&rdquo;
B&#363; &#703;Al&#299; (Avicenna), who is one of the most learned of
hakims and physicians, has written this quatrain&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Wine is a raging enemy, a prudent friend;</p>

<p class="par">With much trouble wine was given to him. I had not drunk
it till I was 15<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6363src" href="#xd24e6363"
name="xd24e6363src">32</a> years old, except when in the time of my
infancy two or three times my mother and wet-nurses gave it by way of
infantile remedy. They asked for a little spirit from my revered
father, and gave it me to the extent of a tola mixed with water and
rosewater to take away a cough, designating it as medicine. At the time
when the camp of my revered father had been pitched in order to put
down the disturbance of Y&#363;sufza&#702;e Afghans at the fort of
Attock, which is on the bank of the N&#299;l&#257;b (Indus) River, one
day I had mounted to go out to hunt. When I had moved about a good deal
and the signs of weariness had set in, a gunner of the name of
Ust&#257;d S&#863;h&#257;h-qul&#299;, a wonderful gunner out of those
under my revered uncle M&#299;rz&#257; Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;ak&#299;m,
said to me that if I would take a cup of wine it would drive away the
feeling of being tired and heavy. It was in the time of my youth, and
as I felt disposed towards it I ordered Mahm&#363;d, the
&#256;b-d&#257;r (person in charge of drinking water, etc.), to go to
the house of H&#803;ak&#299;m &#703;Al&#299; and bring me an
intoxicating draught. He sent me<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6366src"
href="#xd24e6366" name="xd24e6366src">33</a> the amount of one and a
half cups of yellow wine of a sweet taste in a little bottle. I drank
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb308" href="#v1pb308" name=
"v1pb308">308</a>]</span>it, and found its quality agreeable. After
that I took to drinking wine, and increased it from day to day until
wine made from grapes ceased to intoxicate me, and I took to drinking
arrack (<i>&#703;araq</i>, spirits), and by degrees during nine years
my potions rose to twenty cups of doubly distilled spirits, fourteen
during the daytime and the remainder at night. The weight of this was
six Hindustani sirs or one and a half maunds of Iran. The extent of my
eating in those days was a fowl<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6374src"
href="#xd24e6374" name="xd24e6374src">34</a> with bread and vegetables
(lit. radish).<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6400src" href="#xd24e6400"
name="xd24e6400src">35</a> In that state of matters no one had the
power to forbid me, and matters went to such a length that in the
crapulous state from the excessive trembling of my hand I could not
drink from my own cup, but others had to give it me to drink, until I
sent for H&#803;ak&#299;m Hum&#257;m, brother of H&#803;ak&#299;m
Ab&#363;-l-fath&#803;, who was of the most intimate with my revered
father, and informed him of my state. He, with excessive sincerity and
unfeigned burning of heart, said to me without hesitation, &ldquo;Lord
of the world, by the way in which you drink spirits, God forbid it, but
in six months matters will come to such a pass that there will be no
remedy for it.&rdquo; As his words were said out of pure good-will, and
sweet life was dear to me, they made an impression on me, and from that
day I began to lessen my allowance and set myself to take
<i>fil&#363;n&#299;y&#257;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6409src"
href="#xd24e6409" name="xd24e6409src">36</a> In <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb309" href="#v1pb309" name=

increased the amount of filuniya.</p>
<p class="par">I also ordered that the arrack should be diluted with
wine of the grape so that there should be two parts wine and one part
arrack. Every day I diminished the quantity I took, and in the course
of seven years I brought it down to six cups. The weight of each cupful
was 18&frac14; misqals. It is now fifteen years that I have drunk at
this rate, neither more nor less. And my drinking time is the night
except on the day of Thursdays, as it is the day of the blessed
accession. Also on the eve<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6455src" href=
"#xd24e6455" name="xd24e6455src">37</a> of Friday, which is the most
blessed eve of the week, and is the prelude to a blessed day (I do not
drink). I drink at the end of each day with these two<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e6461src" href="#xd24e6461" name="xd24e6461src">38</a>
exceptions, for it does not appear right that this eve (Thursday night)
should be spent in neglect, and that there should be an omission (on
Friday) of returning thanks to the True Benefactor. On the day of
Thursday and on the day of Sunday I do not eat <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb310" href="#v1pb310" name=
"v1pb310">310</a>]</span>meat. Not on Thursday, because it is the day
of my auspicious accession, and not on Sunday, because it is the
birthday of my revered father, and he greatly honoured and held dear
the day. After some time I substituted opium for filuniya. Now that my
age has arrived at 46 solar years and 4 months, I eat eight surkhs (a
red berry used as a weight) of opium when five gharis of day have
passed, and six surkhs after one watch of night.</p>
<p class="par">I gave a jewelled dagger to &#703;Abdu-llah

S&#863;haik&#863;h M&#363;s&#257;, a relation of Q&#257;sim

promoted to the mansab of 800 personal and 400 horse, and was allowed
to go to Bengal. The mansab of Z&#804;afar K&#863;h&#257;n was
increased to 500 personal and horse, and he was appointed to duty in
Bangash. On the same day Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain, brother of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, was given the faujd&#257;rship of the
Sarkar of H&#803;i&#7779;&#7779;&#257;r and dismissed, his mansab being
increased by 200 horse to raise it to 500 personal and 400 horse, with
the gift of an elephant. On the 5th Bahman an elephant was conferred on
M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n. When the merchant &#703;Abdu-l-Kar&#299;m
left Iran for Hindustan, my exalted brother S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;Abb&#257;s sent me by his hand a rosary of cornelian from Yemen
and a cup of Venetian workmanship, which was very fine and rare. On the
9th of the same month they were laid before me. On the 18th some
offerings of many kinds of jewelled ornaments, etc., which
Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z had sent to me, were laid before me. On
the 7th Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;, &#7778;&#257;diq, nephew of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, who was permanently employed as Bakhshi,
was honoured with the title of K&#863;h&#257;n. I had also conferred
this title on K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z. According
to what was right, I called him by the title of
&#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K&#863;h&#257;n and &#7778;&#257;diq by
that of &#7778;&#257;diq K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 10th, Jagat Singh, son
of Kunwar Karan, who had obtained leave <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

native country, when he took leave was presented with 20,000 rupees, a
horse, an elephant, a dress of honour, and a special shawl. Five
thousand rupees, a horse, and a dress of honour were also given to
Harid&#257;s Jh&#257;l&#257;, who was one of the confidants of the
R&#257;n&#257; and tutor to Karan&rsquo;s son. By his hand I also sent
a mace of gold (<i>s&#863;has&#863;hpar&#299;</i>) for the
R&#257;n&#257;.</p>
<p class="par">On the 20th of the same month, R&#257;ja S&#363;raj
Singh, son of R&#257;ja B&#257;so, who on account of the nearness of
his dwelling-place to it had been sent with Murtaz&#803;&#257;
K&#863;h&#257;n to capture the fort of K&#257;ngra, came on my summons
and waited on me. The aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n had entertained certain
suspicions with regard to him, and on this account, considering him an
undesirable companion, had repeatedly sent petitions to the Court, and
wrote things about him until an order was received to summon him.</p>
<p class="par">On the 26th, Niz&#804;&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n
K&#863;h&#257;n came from Multan and waited on me. In the end of this
year news of victory and prosperity came in from all sides of my
dominions. In the first place, this was with regard to the disturbance
of Ah&#803;d&#257;d, the Afghan, who for a long time past had been in
rebellion in the hill country of Kabul, and round whom many of the
Afghans of that neighbourhood had assembled, and against whom from the
time of my revered father until now, which is the 10th year after my
accession, armies have always been employed. He by degrees was
defeated, and, falling into a wretched state, a part of his band was
dispersed and a part killed. He took refuge for some time in
Chark&#863;h, which was a place on which he relied, but K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n surrounded it and closed the road for entry and exit. When
there remained no grass for his beasts or means of living for men in
the fortress, he at night brought down his animals from the hills and
grazed them on the skirts, and accompanied them himself, in order that
he might set an example to his men. At last this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb312" href="#v1pb312" name=
"v1pb312">312</a>]</span>intelligence reached K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n. He then appointed a body of his leaders and experienced
men to go into ambush on an appointed night in the neighbourhood of
Chark&#863;h. That band went and hid itself at night in places of
refuge, and K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n rode on the same day in that
direction. When those ill-fated ones brought out their cattle and let
them loose to graze, and the ill-conditioned Ah&#803;d&#257;d himself
passed by the places of ambush with his own band, suddenly a dust rose
in front of him. When they enquired it became known that it was
K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n. In a state of bewilderment he endeavoured
to turn back, and the scouts announced to the aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n
that it was Ah&#803;d&#257;d. The K&#863;h&#257;n gave his horse the
reins and went at Ah&#803;d&#257;d; the men who were in ambush also
blocked the road and attacked him. The fight lasted till midday in
consequence of the broken nature of the ground and the thickness of the
jungle; at last defeat fell on the Afghans and they betook themselves
to the hill: about 300 fighting men went to hell and 100 were taken
prisoners. Ah&#803;d&#257;d could not regain the stronghold and hold on
there. Necessarily he turned his face towards Qandahar. The victorious
troops entering Chark&#863;h, burnt all the places and houses of those
ill-fortuned ones, and destroyed and rooted them up from their
foundations.</p>
<p class="par">Another<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6484src" href=
"#xd24e6484" name="xd24e6484src">39</a> piece of news was the defeat of
the ill-starred &#703;Ambar and the destruction of his unfortunate
army. Briefly, a band of the influential leaders and a body of
Barg&#299;s (Mahrattas), who are a hardy lot and who are the centre of
resistance in that country, becoming angry with &#703;Ambar, showed an
intention to be loyal, and begging for quarter from

</div>
<p class="par first">They reached the camp of that ill-starred one, and
he from excessive pride determined to fight with the victorious troops.
Having collected those rebels who were with him and &#703;&#256;dil
K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s army and that of Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk together,
and preparing their artillery, he started to meet the royal troops
until a space of not more than 5 or 6 kos remained between. On Sunday,
the 25th Bahman, the armies of light and darkness approached each other
and the scouts became visible. Three watches of day had passed when
cannon and rocket firing began. In the end D&#257;r&#257;b
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was in command of the vanguard, with other leaders
and zealous men such as R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo, R&#257;y Chand,
&#703;Al&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n the Tatar, Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299;
Beg Turkm&#257;n, and other lions of the forest of bravery, drew their
swords and charged the vanguard of the enemy. Performing the dues of
manliness and bravery, they scattered this army like the
Ban&#257;tu-n-na&#703;s&#863;h (&lsquo;Daughters of the Bier,&rsquo;
i.e. the Great Bear); and not stopping there they attacked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb314" href="#v1pb314" name=
"v1pb314">314</a>]</span>the enemy&rsquo;s centre. Turning on the army
opposed to them, such a hand-to-hand struggle took place that the
onlookers remained bewildered. For nearly two gharis this combat went
on. Heaps of the dead lay there, and the ill-starred &#703;Ambar,
unable to offer further opposition, turned his face to flight. If
darkness<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6527src" href="#xd24e6527" name=
"xd24e6527src">43</a> and gloom had not come on at the cry of those
black-fortuned ones, not one of them would have found the road to the
valley of safety. The crocodiles of the river of conflict followed the
fugitives for 2 or 3 kos. When horses and men could move no more and
the defeated were scattered, they drew rein and returned to their
places. The whole of the enemy&rsquo;s artillery, with 300 laden camels
that carried rockets, war elephants, Arab and Persian horses, weapons
and armour beyond reckoning, fell into the hands of the servants of the
State, and there was no counting the slain and the fallen. A great many
of the leaders fell alive into their hands. The next day the victorious
troops, marching from the place of victory, proceeded to Kark&#299;,
which was the nest of those owlish ones, and seeing no trace of them
they encamped there, and obtained news that they during that night and
day had fallen miserably in different places. For some days the
victorious army, delayed at Kark&#299;, levelled with the dark earth
the buildings and houses of the enemy, and burnt that populous place.
In consequence of the occurrence of certain events, to describe which
in detail would take too long here, they returned from that place and
descended by the Rohan Khan&#7693;a Pass. In reward for this service I
ordered increases to be made in the mansabs of a number who had shown
zeal and bravery.</p>
<p class="par">The third piece of news was the conquest of the province
of Khokhar&#257;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6532src" href="#xd24e6532"
name="xd24e6532src">44</a> and the acquisition of the diamond
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb315" href="#v1pb315" name=
"v1pb315">315</a>]</span>mines, which were taken by the excellent
exertions of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n. This province is one of
the dependencies of the Subah of Behar and Patna. There is a river
there from which they procure diamonds. At the season when there is
little water, there are pools and water-holes, and it has become known
by experience to those who are employed in this work that above every
water-hole in which there are diamonds, there are crowds of flying
animals of the nature of gnats, and which in the language of India they
call <i>jh&#299;ng&#257;</i>(?).<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6540src"
href="#xd24e6540" name="xd24e6540src">45</a> Keeping the bed of the
stream in sight as far as it is accessible, they make a collection of
stones (<i>sangch&#299;n</i>) round the water-holes. After this they
empty the water-holes with spades and shovels to the extent of a yard
or 1&frac12; yards and dig up the area. They find among the stones and
sand large and small diamonds<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6578src" href=
"#xd24e6578" name="xd24e6578src">46</a> and bring them out. It
occasionally happens that they find a piece of diamond worth 100,000
rupees. Briefly, this province and this river were in possession of a
Hindu Zamindar of the name of Durjan S&#257;l, and although the
governors of the Subah frequently sent armies against him and went
there themselves, in consequence of the difficult roads and thickness
of the jungles they contented themselves with taking two or three
diamonds and left him in his former condition. When the aforesaid Subah
was transferred from Z&#804;afar K&#863;h&#257;n, and Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
K&#863;h&#257;n was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb316" href=
"#v1pb316" name="v1pb316">316</a>]</span>appointed in his place, at the
time of his taking leave I ordered him to go and take the province out
of the possession of that unknown and insignificant individual. As soon
as he arrived in the province of Behar he assembled a force and went
against that Zamindar. According to former custom he sent some of his
men with a promise to give some diamonds and some elephants, but the
K&#863;h&#257;n did not agree to this and entered impetuously into the
province. Before the fellow could collect his men he found guides and
invaded it. Just when the zamindar received this news, the hills and
vales that are his abode were beleaguered. Ibr&#257;h&#299;m sent men
about to find him and they got hold of him in a cave with several
women, one of whom was his mother, while others were also his
father&rsquo;s wives. They arrested him, and also one of his brothers.
They searched and took from them the diamonds they had with them.
Twenty-three male and female elephants also fell into
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m&rsquo;s hands. In reward for this service the mansab
of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n original and increase, was made up
to 4,000 personal and horse, and he was exalted with the title of
Fath&#803;-jang. Orders were also given for an increase in the mansabs
of those who accompanied him on this service and had shown bravery.
That province is now in possession of the imperial servants of the
State. They carry on work in the bed of the stream, and bring to Court
whatever diamonds are found. A large diamond, the value of which has
been estimated at 50,000 rupees, has lately been brought from there. If
a little pains are taken, it is probable that good diamonds will be
found and be placed in the jewel-room. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

I.O. MSS. and the R.A.S. MS. have 18 instead of 15. Elliot has
&ldquo;up to my fourteenth&rdquo; year. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r was born in
Rab&#299;&#703;, 977, or 31st August, 1569, and the beginning of
wine-drinking to which he refers must have taken place at earliest in
January, 1586. He tells us that it was after the death of
Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;ak&#299;m, and at the time when his father was at
Attock. Now Akbar arrived there on 15th Muh&#803;arram, 994, according
to Niz&#804;&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n, and on 12th Day, 994, according to
Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l, iii, 976, i.e. about the end of December, 1585,
and at that time Jah&#257;ng&#299;r was 17 years and 4 months of age,
or in his 18th year. He continued to drink heavily for nine years, i.e.
till he was 26 (17 + 9), then he moderated for seven years, i.e. till
he was 33, and he kept to that for fifteen years more, i.e. till he was
48. These years were lunar years, and he tells that at the time of
writing he was 47 years and 9 months old, according to the lunar
calendar. It seems to follow that the MSS. are right, and that we
should read 18.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<i>Fil&#363;n&#299;y&#257;.</i> The word is not given in ordinary
dictionaries, but it is explained in Dozy&rsquo;s Supplement. It is
stated there that it is a sedative electuary, and that the word is
derived from the Greek, being <span class="trans" title=
"phil&#333;nia"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&phi;&iota;&lambda;&omega;&nu;&iota;&alpha;</span></span>, which
is the name of an antidote or drug invented by Philon of Tarsus. There
is an account of Philon and a reference to his drug in Smith&rsquo;s
Classical Dictionary. Philon lived in or before the first century after
Christ, and is referred to by Galen and others. The word as given there
is <span class="trans" title="phil&#333;neion"><span class="Greek"
lang="grc">&phi;&iota;&lambda;&omega;&nu;&epsilon;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</span></span>.
We are not told what it was made of. In Price&rsquo;s
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, filuniya, misread there as Kelourica, is described
by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r as brother&rsquo;s son to <i>tiry&#257;q</i>,
i.e. theriaca (see Price, p. 6). <i>Tiry&#257;k</i> or
<i>t&#804;iry&#257;q</i> is supposed to be a Greek word (see Lane), and
means an antidote against poison, etc. It is so used in the verse from
Avicenna quoted by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r to his son S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n. See D&rsquo;Herbelot, s.v. <i>Teriak</i>. But it is also
often used apparently as a synonym for opium. The mixing of wine with
spirits was intended to dilute the potation, for hitherto
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r had been taking raw spirit. A
<i>mis&#804;q&#257;l</i> is said to be 63&frac12; grains troy, and so
18 misqals would be about 3 ounces, and the six cups would be about
1&frac12; lb. troy. In Elliot, Jah&#257;ng&#299;r is made to say that
he does not drink on Thursdays and Fridays. But the
<i>s&#863;hab-i-jum&#703;a</i>, as Blochmann has pointed out elsewhere,
&#256;y&#299;n translation, p. 171, n. 3, means Thursday night or
Friday eve, and this is clearly the case here, for Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
speaks of the eve&rsquo;s being followed by a blessed day. It should be
noted that there is no connection in Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s mind
between abstaining from wine and abstaining from meat. He did not eat
meat on Thursdays or Sundays because he did not approve of taking life
on these days, but he drank on both of them.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

<h2 class="main">The Eleventh New Year&rsquo;s Feast after the
auspicious Accession.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Fifteen gharis of day had passed on Sunday, the
last day of Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;, corresponding with the 1st
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal (19th March, 1616), when from the mansion of
Pisces the sun cast the ray of prosperity on the palace of Aries. At
this auspicious hour, having performed the dues of service and
supplication at the throne of Almighty God, I ascended the throne of
State in the public audience hall, the area of which was laid out with
tents and canopies (<i>s&#863;h&#257;miy&#257;nah&#257;</i>), and its
sides adorned with European screens, painted gold brocades, and rare
cloths. The princes, Amirs, the chief courtiers, the ministers of
State, and all the servants of the Court performed their congratulatory
salutations. As H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804; N&#257;d &#703;Al&#299;,
<i>g&#363;yanda</i> (singer), was one of the ancient servants, I
ordered that whatever offerings were made on the Monday by anyone in
the shape of cash or goods should be given to him by way of reward. On
the 2nd day (of Farward&#299;n) the offerings of some of the
employ&eacute;s were laid before me. On the 4th day the offering of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, who had sent them from Agra, and which
consisted of several diamonds and pearls, of jewelled things, cloth
stuffs of all kinds, and an elephant, worth altogether 50,000 rupees,
was brought before me. On the 5th day, Kunwar Karan, who had been given
leave to go to his home, returned and waited on me. He presented as
offering 100 muhrs, 1,000 rupees, an elephant with fittings, and four
horses. To the mansab of &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, which was
4,000 personal and 2,000 horse, I on the 7th made an addition of 1,000
personal and 2,000 horse, and honoured him with drums and a standard.
On this day the offering of M&#299;r Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n
H&#803;usain was laid before me; what he offered was approved and
accepted. Among the things was a jewelled dagger which had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb318" href="#v1pb318" name=
"v1pb318">318</a>]</span>been made under his superintendence.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6598src" href="#xd24e6598" name="xd24e6598src">1</a>
On its hilt was a yellow ruby<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6607src" href=
"#xd24e6607" name="xd24e6607src">2</a> (<i>y&#257;q&#363;t-i-zard</i>),
exceeding clear and bright, in size equal to half a hen&rsquo;s egg. I
had never before seen so large and beautiful a yellow ruby. Along with
it were other rubies of approved colour and old emeralds. Brokers
(<i>muq&#299;m&#257;n</i>) valued it (the dagger) at 50,000 rupees. I
increased the mansab of the said M&#299;r by 1,000 horse, which brought
it to 5,000 personal and 3,500 horse. On the 8th I increased the mansab
of S&#257;diq H&#803;&#257;z&#817;iq by 300 personal and horse, and
that of Ir&#257;dat K&#863;h&#257;n by 300 personal and 200 horse, so
as to raise each to 1,000 personal and 500 horse. On the 9th the
offering of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan was laid before
me; of jewelled ornaments and cloth stuffs, what was of the value of
40,000 rupees was accepted, and the remainder I made a present to him.
The offering of T&#257;t&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n Bak&#257;wul-beg&#299;,
consisting of one ruby (<i>la&#703;l</i>), one <i>y&#257;q&#363;t</i>,
a jewelled <i>tak&#863;ht&#299;</i> (signet?), two rings, and some
cloths, was accepted. On the 10th three elephants which R&#257;ja
Mah&#257; Singh sent from the Deccan, and 100 and odd pieces of gold
brocade, etc., which Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n sent from
Lahore, were laid before me. On this date Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n
presented his offering of two pearl rosaries, two rubies, six large
pearls, and one gold tray, to the value of 28,000 rupees. At the end of
Thursday, the 11th, I went to the house of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah
in order to add to his dignity. He then presented me with his offering,
and I examined it in detail. Much of it was exceedingly rare. Of jewels
there were two pearls worth 30,000 rupees, one <i>qut&#804;b&#299;</i>
ruby which had been purchased for 22,000 rupees, with other pearls and
rubies. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb319" href="#v1pb319" name=
"v1pb319">319</a>]</span>Altogether the value was 110,000 rupees. These
had the honour of acceptance, and of cloth, etc., the value of 15,000
rupees was taken. When I had finished inspecting the offering I passed
nearly one watch of the night in conviviality and enjoyment. I ordered
that cups (of wine) should be given to the Amirs and servants. The
ladies of the <i>mah&#803;all</i> (harem) were also with me, and a
pleasant assembly was held. After the festive assembly was over I
begged I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah to excuse me, and went to the hall
of audience. On the same day I ordered N&#363;r-mah&#803;all Begam to
be called N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam. On the 12th the offering of
I&#703;tib&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n was laid before me. They had made a
vessel (<i>z&#804;arf</i>) in the form of a fish, jewelled with
beautiful gems, exceedingly well shaped and calculated to hold my
allowance.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6638src" href="#xd24e6638" name=
"xd24e6638src">3</a> This, with other jewels and jewelled things and
cloth stuffs, the value of which was worth 56,000 rupees, I accepted
and gave back the rest. Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of
Qandahar, had sent seven Iraq horses and nine <i>tuq&#363;z</i> (81?)
of cloth stuffs. The offerings of Ir&#257;dat K&#863;h&#257;n and
R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Mal, son of R&#257;ja B&#257;so, were laid before
me on the 13th. &#703;Abdu-s-Subh&#803;&#257;n, who held a mansab of
1,200 personal and 600 horse, was promoted to 1,500 personal and 700
horse. On the 15th the Subahdarship of the province of Thatha was
transferred from S&#863;hams&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n &#362;zbeg
to Muz&#804;affar K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 16th the offering of
I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n, son of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah,
was laid before me. Of this the equivalent of 32,000 rupees was taken,
and I gave back the rest to him. On the 17th the offering of Tarbiyat
K&#863;h&#257;n was inspected. Of jewels and cloth what was valued at
17,000 rupees was approved. On the 18th I went to the house of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, and his offering was presented to me
there. From the palace <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb320" href=
"#v1pb320" name="v1pb320">320</a>]</span>to his house was a distance of
about a kos. For half the distance he had laid down under foot velvet
woven with gold and gold brocade and plain velvet, such that its value
was represented to me as 10,000 rupees. I passed that day until
midnight at his house with the ladies. The offerings he had prepared
were laid before me in detail. Jewels, jewelled ornaments, and things
of gold and beautiful cloth stuffs, things of the value of 114,000
rupees, four horses, and one camel were approved of. On the 19th
(Farward&#299;n), which was the day of honour
(<i>r&#363;z-i-s&#863;haraf</i>) of the sun, a grand assembly was held
in the palace. In order to observe the auspicious hour, when 2&frac12;
gharis of day were left of the aforesaid day, I seated myself on the
throne. My son B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram at this blessed hour laid
before me a ruby of the purest water and brilliancy, which they
pronounced to be of the value of 80,000 rupees. I fixed his mansab,
which was 15,000 personal and 8,000 horse, at 20,000 personal and
10,000 horse. On the same day my lunar weighing took place. I increased
the mansab of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, which was 6,000 personal and
3,000 horse, to 7,000 personal and 5,000 horse, and bestowed on him a
<i>t&#363;m&#257;n t&#363;g&#863;h</i> (horse-tail standard), and
ordered his drums to be beaten after those of my son K&#863;hurram. I
increased the mansab of Tarbiyat K&#863;h&#257;n by 500 personal and
horse, so as to bring it to 3,500 personal and 1,500 horse. The mansab
of I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n was increased by 1,000 personal
and 400 horse. Niz&#804;&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n was
promoted to 700 personal and 300 horse, and appointed to the Subah of
Behar. Sal&#257;mu-llah, the Arab, was honoured with the title of
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n, and, being dignified with a
necklace of pearls, became one of the royal<a class="noteref" id=

promoted M&#299;r Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n Inj&#363; to the title of
&#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daulah (Arm of the State). On the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb321" href="#v1pb321" name=

the daughter of Muq&#299;m, son of Mihtar F&#257;z&#803;il
Rik&#257;b-d&#257;r (stirrup-holder). To Allah-d&#257;d, the Afghan,
who, accepting my service, had separated himself from the evil-minded
Ah&#803;d&#257;d and come to Court, I gave 20,000 darabs (10,000
rupees). On the 25th came the news of the death of R&#257;y Manohar,
who had been attached to the army of the Deccan. Giving his son a
mansab of 500 personal and 300 horse, I bestowed upon him his
father&rsquo;s place and property. On the 26th the offering of N&#257;d
&#703;Al&#299; Maid&#257;n&#299;, consisting of nine horses, several
bits (? <i>dah&#257;na k&#299;s&#863;h</i><a class="noteref" id=

Persian camels (<i>wil&#257;yat&#299;</i>), was brought before me. On
the 28th I presented Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of
Qandahar, M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n, son of K&#863;hal&#299;lu-llah, and
Sayyid B&#257;yaz&#299;d, governor of Bhakar, each with an elephant. On
the 1st Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, at the request of &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n, I presented drums to his brother Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 3rd I gave Allah-d&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n, the
Afghan, a jewelled <i>khapwa</i> (dagger). On the same day news came
that Qadam,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6681src" href="#xd24e6681" name=
"xd24e6681src">6</a> one of the Afr&#299;d&#299; Afghans who had been
loyal and obedient, and to whom the <i>r&#257;h-d&#257;r&#299;</i>
(transit dues) of the Khaibar Pass belonged, from some slight suspicion
had withdrawn his feet from the circle of obedience and raised his head
in sedition. He had sent a force against each of the posts
(<i>th&#257;na</i>), and wherever he and his men went, through the
carelessness of those men (in the posts), had plundered and killed many
of the people. Briefly, in consequence of the shameful action of this
senseless Afghan, a new disturbance broke out in the hill country of
Kabul. When this news arrived I ordered H&#257;r&#363;n, brother of
Qadam, and Jal&#257;l, his son, who were at Court, to be apprehended
and handed over to &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n to be imprisoned in
the fort of Gwalior. By the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb322"
href="#v1pb322" name="v1pb322">322</a>]</span>manifestation of the
Divine mercy and kindness and the signs of God&rsquo;s favour, an
affair took place at this time which is not devoid of strangeness.
After the victory over the R&#257;n&#257; my son presented me in Ajmir
with an exceedingly beautiful and clear ruby, valued at 60,000 rupees.
It occurred to me that I ought to bind this ruby on my own arm. I much
wanted two rare pearls of good water of one form to be a fit match for
this kind of ruby. Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n had procured one grand
pearl of the value of 20,000 rupees, and given it to me as a New
Year&rsquo;s offering. It occurred to me that if I could procure a pair
to it they would make a perfect bracelet. K&#863;hurram, who from his
childhood had had the honour of waiting on my revered father, and
remained in attendance on him day and night, represented to me that he
had seen a pearl in an old turban (<i>sar-band</i>) of a weight and
shape equal to this pearl. They produced an old <i>sar-p&#299;ch</i>
(worn on the turban), containing a royal pearl of the same quality,
weight, and shape, not differing in weight even by a trifle, so much so
that the jewellers were astonished at the matter. It agreed in value,
shape, lustre, and brilliance; one might say they had been shed from
the same mould. Placing the two pearls alongside of the ruby, I bound
them on my arm, and placing my head on the ground of supplication and
humility, I returned thanks to the Lord that cherished His slave, and
made my tongue utter His praise&mdash;</p>

<p class="par first">On the 5th (Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht) 30 Iraq and
Turki horses that Murtaz&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n had sent from Lahore

which he had sent from Kabul, were accepted. Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n
presented an offering of a small elephant from Abyssinia which they had
brought by sea in a ship. In comparison with the elephants of Hindustan
it presents some peculiarities. Its ears are larger than the ears of
the elephants of this place, and its trunk and tail are longer. In the
time of my revered father I&#703;tim&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n of Cujarat
sent a young elephant<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6729src" href=
"#xd24e6729" name="xd24e6729src">9</a> as an offering; by degrees it
grew up and was very fiery and bad-tempered. On the 7th a jewelled
dagger was given to Muz&#804;affar K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of Thatha.
On the same day news came that a band of Afghans<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6732src" href="#xd24e6732" name="xd24e6732src">10</a> had
attacked &#703;Abdu-s-Subh&#803;&#257;n, brother of K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam, who was stationed at one of the posts, and had laid
siege to his post. &#703;Abdu-s-Subh&#803;&#257;n, with certain other
mansabdars and servants who had been appointed to go with him had
behaved valiantly. But at last, in accordance with the
saying&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;When gnats get wings they smite the

</div>
<p class="par first">those dogs overcame them, and elevated

the dignity of martyrdom.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6740src" href=
"#xd24e6740" name="xd24e6740src">11</a> As a condolence for this affair
a gracious farman and a special dress of honour were sent to
K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, who had been appointed ambassador to
Iran (and was still in that country). On the 14th the offering of
Mukarram K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Mu&#703;azzam K&#863;h&#257;n, came
from Bengal. It consisted of jewels and articles procurable in that
province, and was brought before me. I increased the mansab of some of
the jagirdars of Gujarat. Of these, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb324" href="#v1pb324" name="v1pb324">324</a>]</span>Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, whose mansab was that of 1,000 personal and 500 horse,
was raised to 1,500 personal and 300<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6745src" href="#xd24e6745" name="xd24e6745src">12</a> horse, and
had a standard given to him as well. Sayyid Q&#257;sim, son of Sayyid
Dil&#257;war B&#257;rha, was raised to an original and increased mansab
of 800 personal and 450 horse, and Y&#257;r Beg, nephew of Ah&#803;mad
Q&#257;sim Koka, to one of 600 personal with 250 horse. On the 17th
there came the news of the death of Razz&#257;q of Merv, the &#362;zbeg
who belonged to the army of the Deccan. He was well skilled in war, and
one of the distinguished Amirs of M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr. On
the 21st, Allah-d&#257;d, the Afghan, was honoured with the title of
K&#863;h&#257;n, and his mansab, which was 1,000 personal and 600
horse, was raised to 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. Three hundred
thousand rupees out of the treasury of Lahore were ordered as a reward
and for expenses to K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n, who had greatly
exerted himself in the Afghan disturbance. On the 28th, Kunwar Karan
obtained leave to go home for his marriage. I conferred on him a dress
of honour, a special Iraq horse with a saddle, an elephant, and a
jewelled waist-dagger. On the 3rd of this month
(K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d) the news of the death of Murtaz&#803;&#257;
K&#863;h&#257;n came. He was one of the ancients of this State. My
revered father had brought him up and raised him to a position of
consequence and trust. In my reign also he obtained the grace of
noteworthy service, namely the overthrow of K&#863;husrau. His mansab
had been raised to 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse. As he was at this
time Subahdar of the Panjab, he had undertaken the capture of
K&#257;ngra, to which in strength no other fort in the hill country of
that province or even in the whole inhabited world can be compared. He
had obtained leave to go on this duty. I was much grieved in mind at
this news; in truth, grief at the death of such <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb325" href="#v1pb325" name=
"v1pb325">325</a>]</span>a loyal follower is only reasonable. As he had
died after spending his days in loyalty, I prayed to God for pardon for
him. On the 4th K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d the mansab of Sayyid
Niz&#804;&#257;m was fixed, original and increase, at 900 personal and
650 horse. I gave N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299; the post of
entertainer to the ambassadors from all parts. On the 7th news came of
the death of Saif K&#863;h&#257;n B&#257;rha; he was a brave and
ambitious young man. He had exerted himself in an exemplary way in the
battle with K&#863;husrau. He bade farewell to this perishable world in
the Deccan through cholera (<i>haiz&#803;a</i>). I conferred favours on
his sons. &#703;Al&#299; Muh&#803;ammad, who was the eldest and most
upright of his children, was given the mansab of 300<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e6754src" href="#xd24e6754" name="xd24e6754src">13</a> personal
and 400 horse, and his (&#703;Al&#299; Muh&#803;ammad&rsquo;s) brother,
by name Bah&#257;dur, that of 400 personal and 200 horse. Sayyid
&#703;Al&#299;, who was his nephew, received an increase in rank of 500
personal and horse. On the same day K&#863;h&#363;b-Allah, son of
S&#863;h&#257;h-b&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n Kamb&#363;, received the title
of Ran-b&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 8th<a class="noteref" id=

of H&#257;shim K&#863;h&#257;n, original and increase, was fixed at
2,500 personal and 1,800 horse. On this date I bestowed 20,000
<i>darabs</i> (10,000 rupees) on Allah-d&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n, the
Afghan. Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, Raja of the province of B&#257;ndh&#363;,
whose ancestors were considerable zamindars in Hindustan, through the
patronage of my fortunate son B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram, obtained
the blessing of paying his respects to me, and his offences were
pardoned. On the 9th,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6766src" href=
"#xd24e6766" name="xd24e6766src">15</a> Kaly&#257;n of Jesalm&#299;r,
to summon whom R&#257;ja Kishan D&#257;s had gone, came and waited on
me. He presented 100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees. His elder brother
R&#257;wal Bh&#299;m was a person of distinction. When he died he left
a son 2 months old, and he too did not live <span class=

taken his daughter in marriage, and called her by the title of
Malika-Jah&#257;n<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6771src" href="#xd24e6771"
name="xd24e6771src">16</a> (queen of the world). As the ancestors of
this tribe had come of ancient loyal people, this alliance took place.
Having summoned the aforesaid Kaly&#257;n, who was the brother of
R&#257;wal Bh&#299;m, I exalted<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6775src"
href="#xd24e6775" name="xd24e6775src">17</a> him with the
<i>t&#299;ka</i> of R&#257;ja and the title of R&#257;wal. News came
that after the death of Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n loyalty was
shown by R&#257;ja M&#257;n, and that, after giving encouragement to
the men of the fort of K&#257;ngra an arrangement had been made that he
should bring to Court the son of the Raja of that country, who was 29
years old. In consequence of his great zeal in this service, I fixed
his mansab, which was 1,000 personal and 800 horse, at 1,500 personal
and 1,000 horse. K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n was promoted from his
original and increased mansab to that of 4,000 personal and 2,500
horse. On this date<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6781src" href=
"#xd24e6781" name="xd24e6781src">18</a> an event occurred such that,
although I was greatly desirous of writing it down, my hand and heart

pustules (<i>&#257;bila</i>) appeared, and on the 26th of the same
month, corresponding with Wednesday, the 29th Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal
(15th June, 1616), in the year 1025, the bird of her soul flew from her
elemental cage and passed into the gardens of Paradise. From this date
an order was given that Ch&#257;r-s&#863;hamba (Wednesday) should be
called Kam-s&#863;hamba (or <i>Gum-s&#863;hamba</i>). What shall I
write as to what happened to the pure personality of the shadow of God
in consequence of this heartburning event and grief-increasing
calamity? Inasmuch as it happened after this manner to that soul of the
world, what must be the condition of those other<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6807src" href="#xd24e6807" name="xd24e6807src">22</a> servants
whose life was bound up with that pure personality? For two days the
servants were not received in audience, and an order was given that a
wall should be built in front of the house which had been the abode of
that bird of paradise, so that it might not be seen. In addition to
this he did not adorn the gate of the hall of audience (did not come
there). On the third day he went in an agitated state to the house of
the illustrious prince, and the servants had the good fortune to pay
their salutations and found fresh life. On the road, however much the
H&#803;az&#803;rat (the Emperor) desired to control himself, the tears
flowed from the auspicious eyes, and for a long time it was so that at
the mere hearing of a word from which came a whiff of pain, the state
of the H&#803;az&#803;rat became bewildered. He remained for some days
in the house of the prince of the inhabitants of the world, and on
Monday<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6810src" href="#xd24e6810" name=
"xd24e6810src">23</a> of T&#299;r, Divine month, he went to the house
of &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, and turned back thence to the
Chas&#863;hma-i-N&#363;r, and for two or <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb328" href="#v1pb328" name="v1pb328">328</a>]</span>three days
employed himself there. But as long as he was in Ajmir he could not
control himself. Whenever the word &lsquo;friendship&rsquo; reached his
ear, the tears would drop from his eyes unrestrained, and the hearts of
his faithful followers were torn in pieces. When the departure of the
cort&egrave;ge of fortune to the Subah of the Deccan took place, he
gained a little composure.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On this date Prith&#299; Chand, son of R&#257;y Manohar,
obtained the title of Ray and the mansab of 500 personal and 400 horse,
and a jagir in his native place. On Saturday, the 11th, I went from the
Chas&#863;hma-i-N&#363;r to the palace at Ajmir. On the eve of Sunday,
the 12th, after 37 seconds had passed, at the time of the ascension of
Sagittarius to the 27th degree, by the calculations of the Hindu
astronomers, and the 15th degree of Capricorn, by the calculations of
the Greeks, there came from the womb of the daughter of &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n (wife of K&#863;hurram) a precious pearl into the world
of being. With joy and gladness at this great boon the drums beat
loudly, and the door of pleasure and enjoyment was opened in the face
of the people. Without delay or reflection the name of S&#863;h&#257;h
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at came to my tongue. I hope that his coming will
be auspicious and blessed to me and to his father. On the 12th a
jewelled dagger<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6817src" href="#xd24e6817"
name="xd24e6817src">24</a> and an elephant were bestowed on R&#257;wal
Kaly&#257;n of Jesalm&#299;r. On the same day arrived the news of the
death of K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K&#863;h&#257;n, whose jagir
was in the Sarkar of Qanauj. I gave an elephant to R&#257;y Kunwar,
Diwan of Gujarat. On the 22nd of the same month (T&#299;r) I added 500
personal and horse to the mansab of R&#257;ja Mah&#257; Singh, so as to
make it one of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse. The mansab of
&#703;Al&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n Tat&#257;r&#299;, who before this had
been exalted with the title of Nu&#7779;rat K&#863;h&#257;n, was fixed
at 2,000 personal and 500 horse, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb329" href="#v1pb329" name="v1pb329">329</a>]</span>a standard was
also conferred on him. With a view to the accomplishment of certain
purposes, I had made a vow that they should place a gold railing with
lattice-work at<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6822src" href="#xd24e6822"
name="xd24e6822src">25</a> the enlightened tomb of the revered
K&#863;hw&#257;ja. On the 27th of this month it was completed, and I
ordered them to take and affix it. It had been made at a cost of
110,000 rupees. As the command and leading of the victorious army of
the Deccan had not been carried out to my satisfaction by my son
Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z, it occurred to me to recall him, and
send B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram as the advanced guard of the
victorious army, inasmuch as the signs of rectitude and knowledge of
affairs were evident in him, and that I myself would follow him, so
that this important matter would be carried through in one and the same
campaign. With this object a farman had already been sent in the name
of Parw&#299;z ordering him to start for the Subah of Allahabad, which
is in the centre of my dominions. Whilst I was engaged in the campaign,
he would be entrusted with the guarding and administration of that
region. On the 29th of the same month a letter came from
Bih&#257;r&#299; D&#257;s, the news-writer of Burh&#257;np&#363;r, that
the prince on the 20th had left the city safely and well and gone
towards the aforesaid Subah. On the 1st Amurd&#257;d I bestowed a
jewelled turban on M&#299;rz&#257; R&#257;ja Bh&#257;o Singh. An
elephant was conferred on the shrine of Kus&#863;ht&#299;g&#299;r. On
the 18th, Las&#863;hkar K&#863;h&#257;n had sent four ambling
(<i>r&#257;hw&#257;r</i>) horses, and they were brought before me.
M&#299;r Mughal was appointed to the faujd&#257;rship of the Sarkar of
Sambal in the place of Sayyid &#703;Abdu-l-W&#257;ris&#804;, who had
obtained the governorship of the Subah of Qanauj in the place of
K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K&#863;h&#257;n. His mansab, in view of
that duty, was fixed at 500 personal and horse. On the 21st the
offering of R&#257;wal Kaly&#257;n of Jesalm&#299;r was laid before
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb330" href="#v1pb330" name=
"v1pb330">330</a>]</span>me; it was 3,000 muhrs, 9 horses, 25 camels,
and 1 elephant. The mansab of Qizil-b&#257;s&#863;h K&#863;h&#257;n was
fixed original and increase, at 1,200 personal and 1,000 horse. On the
23rd, S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n obtained leave to go to
his jagir that he might arrange the affairs of his servants and his
territory, and present himself at the time agreed upon. In this
year,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6834src" href="#xd24e6834" name=
"xd24e6834src">26</a> or rather in the 10th year after my accession, a
great pestilence appeared in some places in Hindustan. The commencement
of this calamity was in the parganahs of the Panjab, and by degrees the
contagion spread to the city of Lahore. Many of the people, Musulmans
and Hindus, died through this. After this it spread to Sirhind and the
D&#363;&#702;&#257;b, until it reached Delhi and the surrounding
parganahs and villages, and desolated them. At this day it had greatly
diminished. It became known from men of great age and from old
histories that this disease had never shown itself in this
country<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6837src" href="#xd24e6837" name=
"xd24e6837src">27</a> (before). Physicians and learned men were
questioned as to its cause. Some said that it came because there had
been drought for two years in succession and little rain fell: others
said it was on account of the corruption of the air which occurred
through the drought and scarcity. Some attributed it to other causes.

had insulted him by carrying him away to his house, and had done this
and that to him. This matter appeared serious to me, and I was desirous
at once to cast him out of favour and ruin him. At last it occurred to
me to send Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n to Ahmadabad to enquire into
this matter on the spot from disinterested people to see if it had
actually occurred and if so, to bring &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
with him to the Court, leaving the charge and administration of
Ahmadabad to Sard&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, his brother. Before
Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n started, the news reached
F&#299;r&#363;z-jang, and he in a state of great perturbation confessed
himself an offender and started for the Court on foot. Day&#257;nat
K&#863;h&#257;n met him on the road, and seeing him in a strange
condition, as he had wounded his feet with walking, he put him on
horseback, and taking him with him came to wait on me. Muqarrab
K&#863;h&#257;n, who is one of the old servants of the Court, from the
time when I was a prince had continually wanted the Subah of Gujarat.
It thus occurred to me that, as this kind of action on the part of
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n had come about, I might fulfil the hope
of an ancient servant and send him to Ahmadabad in the place of the
aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n. A fortunate hour was chosen in these days,
and I appointed him to be ruler of the Subah. On the 10th the mansab of
Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of Qandahar, which was 4,000
personal and 3,000 horse, was increased by 500 personal.</p>
<p class="par">S&#863;hauq&#299;, the mandolin player, is the wonder of
the age. He also sings Hindi and Persian songs in a manner that clears
the rust from all hearts. I delighted him with the title of &#256;nand
K&#863;h&#257;n: &#256;nand in the Hindi language means pleasure and
ease. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb332" href="#v1pb332" name=

and looked after the mangoes there in such a manner as to prolong the
season for more than two months, and sent them every day fresh into the
special fruit store-house. As this was altogether an unusual thing to
be accomplished, it has been recorded here. On the 8th a beautiful Iraq
horse of the name of La&#703;l B&#299;-bah&#257; (priceless ruby) was
sent for Parw&#299;z by the hand of S&#863;har&#299;f, one of his
attendants.</p>
<p class="par">I had ordered quick-handed stone-cutters to carve
full-sized figures of the R&#257;n&#257; and his son Karan out of
marble. On this day they were completed and submitted to me. I ordered
them to be taken to Agra and placed in the garden<a class="noteref" id=

<i>jharoka</i> (exhibition-window). On the 26th the meeting for my
solar weighing was held in the usual manner. The first weight came to
6,514 <i>t&#363;lcha</i> of gold. I was weighed twelve times against
different things; the second weighing was against quicksilver, the
third against silk, the fourth against various perfumes, such as
ambergris and musk, down to sandalwood, <i>&#703;&#363;d</i>,
<i>b&#257;n</i>, and so on, until twelve weighings were completed. Of
animals, according to the number of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

given to fakirs and dervishes. This rule has been observed from the
time of my revered father up to the present day in this enduring State.
They divide after the weighing all these things among the fakirs and
those in need to the value of about 100,000 rupees.</p>
<p class="par">This day a ruby which Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n had
purchased at Burhanpur for 65,000 rupees from &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n F&#299;r&#363;z-jang was laid before me, and was
approved of. It is a ruby of beautiful form. The special mansab of
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am was fixed at 7,000 personal, and an
order was passed that the diwani establishment should pay an equivalent
to that in a <i>tank&#863;hw&#257;h j&#257;g&#299;r</i>. At the request
of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, what had been deducted from the mansab
of Day&#257;nat on account of former proceedings was allowed to remain
as before. &#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daulah, who had obtained the Subah of
Malwa in jagir, took his leave, and was dignified with the gift of a
horse and a dress of honour. The mansab of R&#257;wal Kaly&#257;n of
Jesalmir was fixed at 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, <span class=

(Jesalmir) should be given him as tankhwah. As the (auspicious) hour of
his departure was on that same day, he took leave to depart for his
province well pleased and exalted with the gift of a horse, an
elephant, a jewelled sword, a jewelled <i>khapwa</i> (dagger), a robe
of honour, and a special Kashmir shawl. On the 31st Muqarrab
K&#863;h&#257;n took leave to go to Ahmadabad, and his mansab, which
was 5,000 personal and 2,500 horse, was fixed at 5,000 personal and
horse, and he was honoured with a dress of honour, a
<i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> (a kind of dress), a <i>takma</i><a class=

stable, a special elephant, and a jewelled sword were also bestowed on
him. He went off to the aforesaid Subah with delight and in a state of
happiness. On the 11th of Mihr, Jagat Singh, son of Kunwar Karan, came
from his native place and waited on me. On the 16th, M&#299;rz&#257;
&#703;Al&#299; Beg Akbars&#863;h&#257;h&#299; came from the province of
Oudh, which had been given him in jagir, and waited on me. He presented
as offerings 1,000 rupees, and he produced before me an elephant which
one of the zamindars of that province possessed, and which he had been
ordered to take from him. On the 21st the offering of Qutbu-l-mulk, the
ruler of Golcondah, consisting of some jewelled ornaments, was
inspected by me. The mansab of Sayyid Q&#257;sim B&#257;rha was fixed,
original and increase, at 1,000 personal and 600 horse. On the eve of
Friday, the 22nd, M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Al&#299; Beg, whose age had
passed 75 years, gave up the deposit of his life. Great<a class=

distinguished heroes of this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb335"

the poetic temperament. As his inevitable destiny had been
fulfilled<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6967src" href="#xd24e6967" name=

at the venerated mausoleum of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n, I ordered them to bury him in the same
blessed place.</p>
<p class="par">At the time when I gave leave to the ambassadors of
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n of Bijapur, I had requested that if in
that province there were a wrestler, or a celebrated swordsman, they
should tell &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n to send him to me. After
some time, when the ambassadors returned, they brought a Mughal, by
name S&#863;h&#299;r &#703;Al&#299;, who was born at Bijapur, and was a
wrestler by profession and had great experience in the art, together
with certain sword-players. The performances of the latter were
indifferent, but I put S&#863;h&#299;r &#703;Al&#299; to wrestle with
the wrestlers and athletes who were in attendance on me, and they could
none of them compete with him. One thousand rupees, a dress of honour,
and an elephant were conferred on him; he was exceedingly well made,
well shaped, and powerful. I retained him in my own service, and
entitled him &ldquo;the athlete of the capital.&rdquo; A jagir and
mansab were given him and great favours bestowed on him. On the 24th,
Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been appointed to bring
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n Bah&#257;dur F&#299;r&#363;z-jang,
brought him and waited on me, and presented as an offering 100 muhrs.
On the same date R&#257;m D&#257;s, the son of R&#257;ja R&#257;j
Singh, one of the Rajput Amirs who had died on duty in the Deccan, was
promoted to a mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. As
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n had been guilty of faults, he made
B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram his intercessor, and on the 26th, in order
to please him, I ordered the former <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb336" href="#v1pb336" name="v1pb336">336</a>]</span>to pay his
respects to me. He waited upon me with a face of complete shame, and
presented as offerings 100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees. Before the coming of
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s ambassadors I had made up my
mind that, having sent B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram with the vanguard,
I should myself proceed to the Deccan and carry out this important
affair, which for some reasons had been put off. For this reason I had
given an order that except the prince no one should represent to me the
affairs of the rulers of the Deccan. On this day the prince brought the
ambassadors and laid their representation before me. After the death of
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, R&#257;ja M&#257;n and many of the
auxiliary Sardars had come to Court. On this day, at the request of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, I appointed R&#257;ja M&#257;n as the
leader in the attack on the fort of K&#257;ng&#7771;a. I appointed all
the men to accompany him, and according to the condition and rank of
each made him happy with a present&mdash;a horse, an elephant, a robe
of honour, or money&mdash;and gave them leave. After some days I
conferred on &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, at the request of
B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram, a jewelled dagger, as he was exceedingly
broken-hearted and grieved in mind, and an order was passed that his
mansab should continue as it was before, and that he should remain in
attendance on my son among those appointed for duty in the Deccan. On
the 3rd &#256;b&#257;n I ordered the mansab of Waz&#299;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was in attendance on B&#257;b&#257; Parwiz, to be,
original and increase, 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 4th,
K&#863;husrau, who was in the charge, for safe keeping, of
An&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299; Singh-dalan, for certain considerations was
handed over to &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n. I presented him with a
special shawl. On the 7th (&#256;b&#257;n), corresponding with the 17th
S&#863;haww&#257;l (28th October, 1616), a person of the name of
Muh&#803;ammad Riz&#803;&#257; Beg, whom the ruler of Persia had sent
as his representative, paid his respects. After performing the dues of
prostration and salutation (<i>k&#363;rnis&#863;h, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb337" href="#v1pb337" name=
"v1pb337">337</a>]</span>sijda, tasl&#299;m</i>), he laid before me the
letter he had brought. It was decided that he should produce before me
the horses and other presents he had brought with him. The written and
verbal messages sent were full of friendship, brotherhood, and
sincerity. I gave the ambassador on that same day a jewelled tiara
(<i>t&#257;j</i>) and a dress of honour. As in the letter much
friendliness and affection were displayed, an exact copy is recorded in
the Jah&#257;ng&#299;r-n&#257;ma.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6982src"

B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram left Ajmir for the purpose of the conquest
of the provinces of the Deccan, and it was decided that my son
aforesaid should start by way of advanced guard, followed by the
glorious standards (of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r). On Monday, the 19th,
corresponding with the 9th &#256;b&#257;n, when three gharis of day had
passed, the auspicious palace moved in the same direction in the like
manner. On the 10th the mansab of R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Mal, who had
been appointed to accompany the prince, was made up, original and
increase, to 2,000 personal and horse. On the night of the 19th
&#256;b&#257;n, after my usual custom, I was in the
<i>g&#863;husul-k&#863;h&#257;na</i>. Some of the Amirs and attendants,
and by chance Muh&#803;ammad Riz&#803;&#257; Beg, the ambassador of the
ruler of Persia, were present. When six gharis had passed, an owl came
and sat on top of a high terrace roof belonging to the palace, and was
hardly visible, so that many men failed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb338" href="#v1pb338" name="v1pb338">338</a>]</span>to distinguish
it. I sent for a gun and took aim and fired in the direction that they
pointed out to me. The gun, like the decree of heaven, fell on that
ill-omened bird and blew it to pieces. A shout arose from those who
were present, and involuntarily they opened their lips in applause and
praise. On the same night I talked with the ambassador of my brother
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s, and at last the conversation turned
on the slaying of &#7778;af&#299; M&#299;rz&#257;, his (the
Shah&rsquo;s) eldest son. I asked him because this was a difficulty in
my mind. He represented that if his slaughter had not been carried out
at that time he would certainly have attempted the Shah&rsquo;s life.
As this intention became manifest from his behaviour, the Shah was
beforehand with him and ordered him to be killed. On the same day the
mansab of M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;asan, son of M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam,
was fixed, original and increase, at 1,000 personal and 300 horse. The
mansab of Mu&#703;tamad K&#863;h&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7001src" href="#xd24e7001" name="xd24e7001src">39</a> who had
been appointed to the post of paymaster of the army with B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram, was settled at 1,000 personal and 250 horse. The time
for the leave-taking of B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram had been fixed as
Friday, the 20th (&#256;b&#257;n). At the end of this day he paraded
before me the pick of his men armed and ready in the public hall of
audience. Of the distinguished favours bestowed on the aforesaid son
one was the title of S&#863;h&#257;h, which was made a part of his
name. I ordered that thereafter he should be styled S&#863;h&#257;h
Sult&#804;&#257;n K&#863;hurram. I presented him with a robe of honour,
a jewelled <i>ch&#257;rqab</i>, the fringe and collar of which were
decorated with pearls, an Iraq horse with a jewelled saddle, a Turki
horse, a special elephant called Bans&#299;-badan,<a class="noteref"

special <i>pardala</i> (sword-belt) that had been taken at the conquest
of the fort of Ahmadnagar and was very celebrated, and a jewelled
dagger. He started with great keenness. My trust in Almighty God is
that in this service he may gain renown (lit. become red-faced). On
each of the Amirs and mansabdars, according to his quality and degree,
a horse and an elephant were conferred. Loosening a private sword from
my own waist, I gave it to &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
F&#299;r&#363;z-jang. As Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n had been
appointed to accompany the prince, I gave the duty of
<i>&#703;arz&#803;-mukarrir</i> (reviser of petitions) to
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Q&#257;sim Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n.
Previously<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7022src" href="#xd24e7022" name=

certain sum of money from the royal treasury in the
<i>kotw&#257;l&#299; chab&#363;tara</i> (Police Office). After some
days seven men of that band, with their leader, of the name of Nawal,
were caught, and a portion of that money was recovered. It occurred to
me that as they had been guilty of such boldness I ought to punish them
severely. Each was punished in exemplary fashion, and I ordered Nawal,
the leader of them all, to be thrown under the feet of an elephant. He
petitioned that if I would give the order he would fight the elephant.
I ordered it to be so. They produced a very furious elephant. I bade
them put a dagger into his hand and bring him in front of the elephant.
The elephant several times threw him down, and each time that violent
and fearless man, although he witnessed the punishments of his
comrades, got up again and bravely and with a stout heart struck the
elephant&rsquo;s trunk with the dagger, so that the animal refrained
from attacking him. When I had witnessed this pluck and manliness, I
ordered them to inquire into his history. After a short time, according
to his evil nature and low disposition, he ran away in his longing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb340" href="#v1pb340" name=

greatly, and I ordered the jagirdars of that neighbourhood to hunt him
up and apprehend him. By chance he was caught a second time, and this
time I ordered that ungrateful and unappreciative one to be hanged. The
saying of S&#863;haik&#863;h Mu&#7779;lih&#803;u-d-d&#299;n

had passed, in good condition and with a right purpose I mounted the
Frank carriage, which had four horses attached to it, and left the city

at about sunset alighted at a halting-place about 1&frac34; kos

This <i>t&#257;l</i> is 1&frac12; kos and 5 <i>t&#804;an&#257;b</i>

went to look at the Pushkar lake; to the Chashma-i-N&#363;r I went
thirty-eight times. I went out to hunt tigers, etc., fifty times. I

R&#257;y. On this day I gave an elephant to Mu&#703;tamad
K&#863;h&#257;n. I stayed the next day at this village. On this day a
nilgaw was killed, and I sent two of my falcons to my son
K&#863;hurram. I marched from this village on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb342" href="#v1pb342" name=
"v1pb342">342</a>]</span>3rd &#256;z&#817;ar, and pitched at the
village of B&#257;dhal (M&#257;wal?), 2&frac14; kos distant. On the
road six water-fowl, etc., were killed. On the 4th, having gone
1&frac12; kos, R&#257;msar,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7092src" href=
"#xd24e7092" name="xd24e7092src">49</a> which belongs to
N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam, became the place for the alighting of honour
and glory. A halt was made at this place for eight days. In the place
of K&#863;hidmat-g&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n I here appointed
Hid&#257;yatu-llah <i>m&#299;r-t&#363;zak</i> (master of ceremonies).
On the 5th day 7 antelope, 1 kulang (crane), and 15 fish were killed.
The next day Jagat Singh, son of Kunwar Karan, received a horse and a
robe of honour and took leave for his native place. A horse was also
given to Kes&#863;ho D&#257;s L&#257;l&#257; and an elephant to
Allah-d&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n Afg&#863;han. On the same day I killed a
gazelle, 3 antelope, 7 fish, and 2 water-fowl. On that day was heard
the news of the death of R&#257;ja Sy&#257;m Singh, who belonged to the
army of Bangash. On the 7th day 3 antelope, 5 water-fowl, and a
<i>qas&#863;hqald&#257;g&#863;h</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e7101src"
href="#xd24e7101" name="xd24e7101src">50</a> (coot) were killed. On
Thursday and the eve of Friday, as R&#257;msar belongs to the jagir of
N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n, a feast and entertainment were prepared. Jewels,
jewelled ornaments, fine cloths, sewn tapestry, and every kind of
jewellery were presented as offerings. At night on all sides and in the
middle of the lake, which is very broad, lamps were displayed. An
excellent entertainment was arranged. In the end of the said Thursday,
having also sent for the Amirs, I ordered cups for most<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7113src" href="#xd24e7113" name=
"xd24e7113src">51</a> of the servants. On my journeys by land some
boats are always taken along with the victorious camp; the boatmen
convey them on carts. On the day after this entertainment I went to
fish in these boats, and in a short time 208 large fish came into one
net. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb343" href="#v1pb343" name=
"v1pb343">343</a>]</span>Half of these were of the species of
<i>rak&#363;</i>. At night I divided them among the servants in my own
presence. On the 13th &#256;z&#817;ar I marched from R&#257;msar, and
hunting for 4 kos along the road, the camp was pitched at the village
of Balod&#257;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7121src" href="#xd24e7121"
name="xd24e7121src">52</a> Here I stayed for two days. On the 16th,
moving 3&frac14; kos, I alighted at the village of Nih&#257;l.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7125src" href="#xd24e7125" name=
"xd24e7125src">53</a> On the 18th the march was one of 2&frac14; kos.
On this day I gave an elephant to Muh&#803;ammad Riz&#803;&#257; Beg,
ambassador of the ruler of Persia. The village of Jons&#257; became the
halting-place of the tents of greatness and prosperity. On the 20th I
marched to the halting-place of Deog&#257;on; I hunted along the road
for a distance of 3 kos. I stayed at this place for two days, and at
the end of the day went out to hunt. At this stage a strange affair was
witnessed. Before the royal standards arrived at this halting-place, an
eunuch went to the bank of a large tank there is in the village, and
caught two young <i>s&#257;ras</i>, which are a kind of crane; at
night, when we stopped at this halting-place, two large saras appeared
making loud cries near the ghusul-khana (parlour), which they had
placed on the edge of the tank, as if somebody were exercising
oppression on them. They fearlessly began their cries and came forward.
It occurred to me that certainly some kind of wrong had been done to
them, and probably their young had been taken. After enquiry was made
the eunuch who had taken the young saras brought them before me. When
the saras heard the cries of these young ones, they without control
threw themselves upon them, and suspecting that they had had no food,
each of the two saras placed food in the mouths of the young ones, and
made much lamentation. Taking the two young ones between them, and
stretching out their wings and fondling them, they went off to their
nest. Marching on the 23rd 3&frac34; kos, I alighted at the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb344" href="#v1pb344" name=
"v1pb344">344</a>]</span>village of Bah&#257;s&#363;
(Bh&#257;l&#363;?). Here there was a halt of two days, and each day I
rode to hunt. On the 26th the royal standards moved and the halt was
outside of the village of K&#257;kal. A halt was made after traversing
2 kos. On the 27th the mansab of Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, son of
M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, original and increased, was
fixed at 1,500 personal and 750 horse. Marching on the 29th 2&frac34;
kos, a halt was made at the village of L&#257;s&#257;, near parganah
Boda.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7133src" href="#xd24e7133" name=
"xd24e7133src">54</a> This day corresponded with the festival of
Qurb&#257;n (19th December, 1616). I ordered them to observe the
ordinances of that day. From the date on which I left Ajmir up to the
end of the aforesaid month, viz. the 30th &#256;z&#817;ar, 67 nilgaw,
antelope, etc., and 37 water-fowl etc., had been killed. A march was
made from L&#257;s&#257; on the 2nd Day, and I marched and hunted for 3
kos 10 <i>jar&#299;b</i>, and halted in the neighbourhood of the
village of K&#257;n&#7771;&#257;. On the 4th a march of 3&frac14; kos
was made to the village of S&#363;ra&#7789;h. Marching 4&frac12; kos on
the 6th, a halt was made near the village of Barora
(Barda&#7771;&#257;?). On the 7th, when there was a halt, 50 water-fowl
and 14 qashqaldagh (coot) were killed. The next day was a halt as well.
On this day 27 water-fowl became a prey. On the 9th a march of 4&#8539;
kos was made. Hunting and overthrowing prey, I alighted at the
halting-place of K&#863;h&#363;s&#863;h T&#257;l. At this stage a
report came from Mu&#703;tamad K&#863;h&#257;n that when the territory
of the R&#257;n&#257; became the halting-place of S&#863;h&#257;h
K&#863;hurram, though there had been no agreement to this effect (i.e.
to the R&#257;n&#257;&rsquo;s meeting him), the fame and dignity of the
victorious army had introduced a commotion into the pillars of his
patience and firmness, and he had come and paid his respects to him
when he halted at D&#363;dp&#363;r,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7139src"
href="#xd24e7139" name="xd24e7139src">55</a> which was on the border of
his jagir, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb345" href="#v1pb345" name=
"v1pb345">345</a>]</span>and observing all the dues and ceremonies of
service he had neglected not the smallest portion of them.
S&#863;h&#257;h K&#863;hurram had paid him every attention, and pleased
him with the gift of a dress of honour, a <i>ch&#257;rqab</i>, a
jewelled sword, a jewelled khapwa, Persian and Turki horses, and an
elephant, and dismissed him with every honour. He had also favoured his
sons and relations with dresses of honour, and out of his offering,
which consisted of five elephants, twenty-seven horses, and a tray full
of jewels and jewelled ornaments, had taken three horses and given back
the remainder. It was settled that his son Karan should attend on the
stirrup of B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram in this expedition with 1,500
horse. On the 10th the sons of R&#257;ja Mah&#257; Singh came from
their jagir and native place (Amber) and waited on me in the
neighbourhood of Ran&#7789;ambhor, making an offering of three
elephants and nine horses. Each one of them, according to his
condition, received an increase of mansab. As the neighbourhood of the
said fort became a halting-place for the royal standards, I released
some of the prisoners who were confined in that fort. At this place I
halted for two days and each day went to hunt. Thirty-eight water-fowl
and qashqaldagh (coot) were taken. On the 12th I marched, and after
going 4 kos halted at the village of Koyal&#257;. On the road I killed
fourteen water-fowl and an antelope. On the 14th, having traversed
3&frac34; kos, I halted in the neighbourhood of the village of
Ek&#7789;or&#257;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7148src" href=
"#xd24e7148" name="xd24e7148src">56</a> killing on the road a blue
bull, twelve herons (<i>karw&#257;nak</i>), etc. On the same day
&#256;g&#863;h&#257; F&#257;z&#803;il, who had been appointed deputy
for I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah at Lahore, was dignified with the title
of F&#257;z&#803;il K&#863;h&#257;n. At this stage they had erected the
royal lodging (<i>daulat-k&#863;h&#257;na</i>) on the bank of a tank,
which was exceedingly bright and pleasant. On account of the
pleasantness of the place <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb346" href=
"#v1pb346" name="v1pb346">346</a>]</span>I halted two days there, and
at the end of each went to hunt water-fowl. To this place the younger
son of Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n, by name Bahra-war, came from the
fort of Ran&#7789;ambhor, which is his father&rsquo;s jagir, to pay his
respects to me. He had brought two elephants, both of which were
included in my private stud. I promoted &#7778;af&#299;, son of
Am&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n, to the title of K&#863;h&#257;n, and,
increasing his mansab, made him bakhshi and news-writer of the Subah of
Gujarat. Having travelled 4&frac12; kos on the 17th, I halted at the
village of Las&#257;y&#257;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7160src" href=
"#xd24e7160" name="xd24e7160src">57</a> During the halt I killed one
water-fowl and twenty-three sand-grouse (<i>durr&#257;j</i>). As I had
sent for Las&#863;hkar K&#863;h&#257;n to Court on account of the
disagreement that had occurred between him and K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n, I at this place appointed &#703;&#256;bid

the 19th, having made a march of 2&frac14; kos, an encampment was made
in the neighbourhood of the village of K&#363;r&#257;ka
(Kor&#257;n&#817;?),<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7169src" href=
"#xd24e7169" name="xd24e7169src">59</a> which is situated on the bank
of the Chambal. On account of the excellence of the place and the
pleasantness of its air and water, a halt took place here for three
days. Every day I sat in a boat and went to hunt water-fowl and to
wander over the river. On the 22nd<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7175src"
href="#xd24e7175" name="xd24e7175src">60</a> there was a march, and
having traversed 4&frac12; kos, shooting on the road, the victorious
camp was pitched at the villages of Sult&#804;&#257;np&#363;r and
Ch&#299;la Mala (Ch&#299;l&#257;m&#299;l&#257;?). On this day of halt I
bestowed on M&#299;r&#257;n &#7778;adr Jah&#257;n 5,000 rupees, and
gave him leave to proceed to the place assigned to him as his jagir.
Another 1,000 rupees were given to S&#863;haik&#863;h P&#299;r. On the
25th I marched and hunted for 3&frac12; kos and encamped at the village
of B&#257;s&#363;r.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7178src" href=

halt and one march took place, and on the 27th I marched and hunted

(Varadh&#257;?). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb347" href="#v1pb347"
name="v1pb347">347</a>]</span>Two days halt took place here. In this
month of Day 416 animals were killed, namely, 97 sand-grouse (durraj),
192 qashqaldagh, 1 saras, 7 herons, 118 water-fowl, and 1 hare. On the
1st Bahman, corresponding with the 12th Muharram, 1026 (20th January,
1617), seating myself in boats with the ladies, I went forward one
stage. When one ghari of day remained I arrived at the village of
R&#363;p&#257;he&#7771;&#257;, the halting-place, the distance being 4
kos and 15 jarib. I shot five sand-grouse. On the same day I sent by
the hands of Kaikana winter dresses of honour to twenty-one Amirs on
duty in the Deccan, and ordered him to take 10,000<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e7184src" href="#xd24e7184" name="xd24e7184src">62</a> rupees
from those Amirs as a thanksgiving for the dresses of honour. This
halting-place had much verdure and pleasantness. On the 3rd a march
took place. As on the previous day, I embarked in a boat, and after
traversing 2&#8539; kos the village of K&#257;kh&#257;-d&#257;s
(K&#257;kh&#257;v&#257;s?)<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7187src" href=
"#xd24e7187" name="xd24e7187src">63</a> became the encamping place of
the victorious camp. As I came hunting on the way, a sand-grouse fell
flying into a thicket. After much search it was marked, and I ordered
one of the beaters to surround the thicket and catch it, and went
towards it myself. Meanwhile another sand-grouse rose, and this I made
a falcon seize. Soon afterwards the beater came and laid the
sand-grouse before me. I ordered them to satisfy the falcon with this
sand-grouse, and to keep the one we had caught, as it was a young bird.
(But) before the order reached him the head huntsman fed the falcon
with the sand-grouse (the second one, viz. that which the falcon had
caught). After a while the beater represented to me that if he did not
kill the sand-grouse it would die (and then could not be eaten as not
properly killed). I ordered him to kill it if that was the case. As he
laid his sword on its throat, it with a slight movement freed itself
from the sword and flew away. After I had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb348" href="#v1pb348" name="v1pb348">348</a>]</span>left the boat
and mounted my horse, suddenly a sparrow (<i>kunjis&#863;hk</i>) by the
force of the wind struck the head of an arrow that one of the beaters
who was in my retinue had in his hand, and immediately fell down and
died. I was amazed and bewildered at the tricks of destiny; on one side
it preserved the sand-grouse, whose time had not arrived, in a short
time from three such dangers, and on the other hand made captive in the
hand of destruction on the arrow of fate the sparrow whose hour of
death had come&mdash;</p>

<p class="par first">Dresses of honour for the winter had also been
sent by the hand of Qar&#257;, the <i>yas&#257;wul</i> (usher), to the
Amirs at Kabul. I halted at this place on account of the pleasantness
of the spot and the excellence of the air. On this day there came the
news of the death of N&#257;d &#703;Al&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n
Maid&#257;ni at Kabul. I honoured his sons with mansabs, and at the
request of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n
F&#299;r&#363;z-jang<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7205src" href=

R&#257;wat S&#863;hankar by 500 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 6th
there was a march, and going for 4&#8539; kos by the pass known as
Gh&#257;&#7789;e Ch&#257;nd&#257;, the royal camp was pitched at the
village of Amh&#803;&#257;r (Amj&#257;r?). This valley is very green
and pleasant and good trees are seen in it. Up to this stage, which is
the limit of the country of the Subah of Ajmir, 84 kos had been
traversed. It was also a pleasant stage. N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam here
shot with a gun a <i>qar&#299;s&#863;ha</i>(?), the like of which for
size and beauty of colour had never been seen. I ordered them to weigh
it, and it came to 19 tolas and 5 mashas. The aforesaid village is the
commencement of the Subah of Malwa, which is in the second clime. The
length<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7211src" href="#xd24e7211" name=

of Ga&#7771;ha to the province of B&#257;nsw&#257;la
(B&#257;nswa&#7771;&#257;?) is 245 kos, and its <span class=

"v1pb349">349</a>]</span>breadth from the parganah of Chander&#299; to
the parganah of Nandarb&#257;r is 230 kos. On the east is the province
of B&#257;ndho, and on the north the fort of Narwar, on the south the
province of Bagl&#257;n&#257;, and on the west the Subahs of Gujarat
and Ajmir. Malwa is a large province abounding in water and of a
pleasant climate. There are five rivers in it in addition to streams,
canals, and springs, namely, the Godavar&#299;,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7217src" href="#xd24e7217" name="xd24e7217src">66</a>
Bh&#299;m&#257;, K&#257;l&#299;sindh, N&#299;r&#257;, and Narbada. Its
climate is nearly equable. The land of this province is low, but part
of it is high. In the district of Dh&#257;r, which is one of the noted
places of Malwa, the vine gives grapes twice in the year, in the
beginning of Pisces and the beginning of Leo, but the grapes of Pisces
are the sweeter. Its husbandmen and artificers are not without arms.
The revenue of the province is 24,700,000 dams. When needful there are
obtained from it about 9,300<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7220src" href=
"#xd24e7220" name="xd24e7220src">67</a> horse and four lakhs, 70,300
foot-soldiers, with 100 elephants. On the 8th, moving on 3&frac12; kos,
an encampment was made near K&#863;hair&#257;b&#257;d. On the road 14
sand-grouse and 3 herons were killed, and having traversed and shot
over 3 kos the camp was pitched at the village of Sidh&#257;r&#257;. On
the 11th, while there was a halt, I mounted at the end of the day to
hunt, and killed a blue bull. On the 12th, after traversing 4&frac14;
kos, a halt was made at the village of Bachhay&#257;r&#299;. On that
day R&#257;n&#257; Amar Singh had sent some baskets of figs. In truth
it is a fine fruit, and I had never seen such delicious figs in India.
But one must eat only a few of them; it does harm to eat many. On the
14th there was a march; having traversed 4&#8539; kos, I encamped at
the village of Balbal&#299;. R&#257;ja J&#257;nb&#257; who is an
influential zamindar in these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb350"
href="#v1pb350" name="v1pb350">350</a>]</span>regions, had sent two
elephants as an offering, and they were brought before me. At the same
stage they brought many melons grown in K&#257;r&#299;z near Herat.
K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam had also sent 50 camels. In former
years they had never brought melons in such abundance. On one tray they
brought many kinds of fruit&mdash;K&#257;r&#299;z melons, melons from
Badakhshan and Kabul, grapes from Samarkand<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7225src" href="#xd24e7225" name="xd24e7225src">68</a> and
Badakhshan, apples from Samarkand, Kashmir, Kabul, and from Jalalabad,
which is a dependency of Kabul, and pineapples, a fruit that comes from
the European ports, plants of which have been set in Agra. Every year
some thousands are gathered in the gardens there which appertain to the
private domains
(<i>k&#863;h&#257;li&#7779;a-i-s&#863;har&#299;fa</i>)<a class=

similar in form to an orange, but smaller and better in flavour. They
grow very well in the Subah of Bengal. In what language can one give
thanks for such favours? My revered father had a great liking for
fruit, especially for melons, pomegranates, and grapes. During his time
the K&#257;r&#299;z melons, which are the finest kind, and pomegranates
from Yezd, which are celebrated throughout the world and Samarkand
grapes had not been brought to Hindustan. Whenever I see these fruits
they cause me great regret. Would that such fruit had come in those
days, so that he might have enjoyed them!</p>
<p class="par">On the 15th, which was a halting day, news came of the
death of M&#299;r &#703;Al&#299;, son of Far&#299;d&#363;n
K&#863;h&#257;n Barl&#257;s, who was one of the trusted
<i>am&#299;r-z&#257;das</i> (descended from amirs) of this family (the
Timurides). On the 16th a march took place. Having traversed 4&#8539;
kos, the camp of heavenly dignity was pitched near the village of
Gir&#299;. On the road the scouts brought news that there was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb351" href="#v1pb351" name=
"v1pb351">351</a>]</span>a lion in this neighbourhood. I went to hunt
him and finished him with one shot. As the braveness of the lion
(<i>sh&#299;r babar</i>) has been established, I wished to look at his
intestines. After they were extracted, it appeared that in a manner
contrary to other animals, whose gall-bladder is outside their livers,
the gall-bladder of the lion is within his liver(?). It occurred to me
that the courage of the lion may be from this cause. On the 18th, after
traversing 2&frac34; kos, the village of Amriy&#257; was our
halting-place. On the 19th, which was a halt, I went out to hunt. After
going 2 kos, a village came to view exceedingly sweet and pleasant.
Nearly 100 mango-trees were seen in one garden; I had seldom seen
mango-trees so large and green and pleasant. In the same garden I saw a
<i>bar</i>-tree (a banyan), exceedingly large. I ordered them to
measure its length, breadth, and height in yards (<i>gaz</i>). Its
height from the surface to the highest branch
(<i>sar-s&#863;h&#257;k&#863;h</i>) was 74 cubits
(<i>z&#804;ira&#703;</i>). The circumference of its trunk was
44&frac12; cubits and its breadth<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7279src"
href="#xd24e7279" name="xd24e7279src">71</a> 175&frac12; measured by
the gaz. This has been recorded as it is very unusual. On the 20th was
a march, and on the road a blue bull was shot with a gun. On the 21st,
which was a halt, I went out to hunt at the end of the day. After
returning, I came to the house of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah for the
festival of K&#863;hw&#257;ja K&#863;hiz&#803;r, whom they call
K&#863;hiz&#803;r&#299;; I remained there till a watch of the night had
passed, and then feeling inclined for food I went back to the royal
quarters. On this day I honoured I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah as an
intimate friend by directing the ladies of the harem not to veil their
faces from him. By this favour I bestowed everlasting honour on him. On
the 22nd an order was given to march, and after 3&#8539; kos were
traversed the camp was pitched at the village of B&#363;lghar&#299;
(Nawalkhe&#7771;&#299;?). On the road two blue <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb352" href="#v1pb352" name=
"v1pb352">352</a>]</span>bulls were killed. On the 23rd day of
T&#299;r, which was a halt, I killed a blue bull with a gun. On the
24th, traversing 5 kos, the village of Q&#257;sim-khe&#7771;&#257; was
the halting-place. On the road a white animal<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7286src" href="#xd24e7286" name="xd24e7286src">72</a> was killed,
which resembled the <i>k&#363;t&#257;h p&#257;ya</i> (hog-deer); it had
four horns, two of which were opposite the extremities of its eyes, and
two finger-breadths in height, and the two other horns four
finger-breadths towards the nape of the neck. These were four
finger-breadths in height. The people of India call this animal
<i>d&#363;dh&#257;dh&#257;r&#299;t</i> (<i>dudh&#257;riy&#257;</i>?).
The male has four horns and the female none. It was said that this kind
of antelope has no gall-bladder, but when they looked at its intestines
the gall-bladder was apparent, and it became clear that this report has
no foundation. On the 25th, which was a halt, at the end of the day I
rode out to hunt and killed a female nilgaw with my gun.
B&#257;lj&#363;, nephew of Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, who held the
mansab of 1,000 personal and 850 horse, and had a jagir in Oudh, I
promoted to 2,000 personal and 1,200 horse, dignified him with the
title of Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, and appointed him to the Subah of
Bengal. On the 26th a march took place, and after traversing 4&frac34;
kos a halt was made at the village of Dih Q&#257;z&#803;iy&#257;n,
which is in the neighbourhood of Ujjain. A number of mango-trees in
this place had blossomed. They had pitched the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb353" href="#v1pb353" name=
"v1pb353">353</a>]</span>tents on the bank of a lake, and had prepared
an enchanting place. Pah&#257;&#7771;, son of
G&#863;hazn&#299;n<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7332src" href=
"#xd24e7332" name="xd24e7332src">73</a> K&#863;h&#257;n, was capitally
punished at this stage. Cherishing this unlucky one after the death of
his father, I had given him the fort and province of J&#257;laur, which
was the place of his ancestors. As he was of tender years, his mother
used to forbid him certain evil practices. That eternally black-faced
one with some of his companions one night came into the house and
killed his own full mother with his own hand. This news reached me and
I ordered them to bring him. After his crime was proved against him, I
ordered them to put him to death (<i>kih ba biy&#257;s&#257;
ras&#257;n&#299;dand</i>). At this halting-place a tamarind<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7338src" href="#xd24e7338" name=
"xd24e7338src">74</a>-tree came to view, the form and habit of which
were somewhat strange. The original tree had one trunk; when it had
grown to 6 gaz, it turned into two branches, one of which was 10 and
the other 9&frac12; gaz. The distance between the two branches was
4&frac12; gaz. From the ground to the place where the branches and
leaves came to an end(?), there were on the side of the large branch 16
gaz, and on the other branch 15&frac12; gaz. From the place whence the
branches and green leaves began(?) to the top (trunk?) of the tree was
2&frac12; gaz, and the circumference was 2&frac34; gaz. I ordered them
to make a <i>chab&#363;tara</i> (platform) round it of the height of 3
gaz. As the trunk was very straight and well-shaped, I told my artists
to depict it in the illustrations to the Jah&#257;ng&#299;r-n&#257;ma.
A march was made on the 27th. After traversing 2&#8539; kos, a halt was
made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb354" href="#v1pb354" name=
"v1pb354">354</a>]</span>at the village of Hinduw&#257;l<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7359src" href="#xd24e7359" name=
"xd24e7359src">75</a>; on the road a blue bull was killed. On the 28th,
after traversing 2 kos, the village of K&#257;liy&#257;daha became the
halting-place. K&#257;liy&#257;daha is a building which was made by
N&#257;siru-d-d&#299;n, son of G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n, son
of Sult&#804;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d K&#863;halj&#299;, who was ruler
of Malwa. In the time of his rule he had made it in the neighbourhood
of Ujjain, which is one of the most celebrated cities in the Subah of
Malwa. They say that the heat overcame him so much that he passed his
time in the water. He made this building in the middle of the river,
and divided its waters into canals, and brought the water on all sides,
as well as inside and outside, of the house, and made large and small
reservoirs suited to the place. It is a very pleasant and enjoyable
place, and one of the noted habitations of Hindustan. Before it was
decided to halt at this place I sent architects and ordered them to
clean up the place again. On account of its pleasantness I remained in
this place for three days. At the same place S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n came from his jagir and waited on me. Ujjain is one of
the old cities, and is one of the seven established places of worship
of the Hindus. R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, who introduced the
observation of the heavens and stars into Hindustan, lived in this city
and province. From the time of his observations until now, which is the
1026th Hijra year (1617 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>) and the 11th year
from my accession, 1,675<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7365src" href=
"#xd24e7365" name="xd24e7365src">76</a> years have passed. The
deductions of the astronomers of India are all based on his
observations. This city is on the bank of the River Sipra. The
belief<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7368src" href="#xd24e7368" name=

href="#v1pb355" name="v1pb355">355</a>]</span>Hindus is that once in
some year at an uncertain time the water of this river turns into milk.
In the reign of my revered father, at the time when he had sent
Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l to set in order the affairs of my brother
S&#863;h&#257;h Mur&#257;d, he sent a report from that city that a
large body of Hindus and Musulmans had borne testimony that some days
previously at night this river had become milk, so that people who took
water from it that night found in the morning their pots full of
milk.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7374src" href="#xd24e7374" name=
"xd24e7374src">78</a> As this obtained currency it has been recorded,
but my intelligence will in no way agree to it. The real truth of this
affair is known to Allah. On the 2nd Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817; I embarked
in a boat from K&#257;liy&#257;daha, and went to the next stage. I had
frequently heard that an austere Sany&#257;s&#299;<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e7377src" href="#xd24e7377" name="xd24e7377src">79</a> of the
name of Jadr&#363;p many years ago retired from the city of Ujjain to a
corner of the desert and employed himself in the worship of the true
God. I had a great desire for his acquaintance, and when I was at the
capital of Agra I was desirous of sending for and seeing him. In the
end, thinking of the trouble it would give him, I did not send for him.
When I arrived in the neighbourhood of the city I alighted from the
boat and went &#8539; kos on foot to see him. The place he had chosen
to live in was a hole on the side of a hill which had been dug out and
a door made. At the entrance there is an opening in the shape of a
<i>mih&#803;r&#257;b</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7384src" href=
"#xd24e7384" name="xd24e7384src">80</a> which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb356" href="#v1pb356" name=
"v1pb356">356</a>]</span>is in length (? height) 1 gaz and in breadth
10 <i>gira</i>, (knots, each 1/16 of a gaz), and the distance from this
door to a hole which is his real abode is 2 gaz and 5 knots in length
and in breadth 11&frac14; knots. The height from the ground to the roof
is 1 gaz and 3 knots. The hole whence is the entrance to the abode is
in length 5&frac12; knots and its breadth 3&frac12; knots. A person of
weak body (thin?) can only enter it with a hundred difficulties. The
length and breadth of the hole are such. It has no mat and no straw. In
this narrow and dark hole he passes his time in solitude. In the cold
days of winter, though he is quite naked, with the exception of a piece
of rag that he has in front and behind, he never lights a fire. The
Mulla of R&#363;m (Jal&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n) has put into rhyme the
language of a dervish&mdash;</p>

<p class="par first">He bathes twice a day in a piece of water near his
abode, and once a day goes into the city of Ujjain, and nowhere but to
the houses of three brahmins whom he has selected out of seven, who
have wives and children and whom he believes to have religious feelings
and contentment. He takes by way of alms five mouthfuls of food out of
what they have prepared for their own eating, which he swallows without
chewing, in order that he may not enjoy their flavour; always provided
that no misfortune has happened to their three houses, that there has
been no birth, and there be no menstruous woman in the house. This is
his method of living, just as it is now written. He does not desire to
associate with men, but as he has obtained great notoriety people go to
see him. He is not devoid of knowledge, for he has thoroughly mastered
the science of the Ved&#257;nta, which is the science of Sufism. I
conversed with him for six gharis; he spoke well, so much so as to make
a great impression on me. My society also suited him. <span class=

<p class="par">The learned of India have established four modes of life
for the caste of brahmins, which is the most honoured of the castes of
Hindus, and have divided their lives into four periods. These four
periods they call the four <i>&#257;sram</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7417src" href="#xd24e7417" name="xd24e7417src">81</a> The boy who
is born in a brahmin&rsquo;s house they do not call brahmin till he is
7 years old, and take no trouble on the subject. After he has arrived
at the age of 8 years, they have a meeting and collect the brahmins
together. They make a cord of <i>m&#363;nj</i> grass, which they call
<i>m&#363;nj&#299;</i>, in length 2&frac14; gaz, and having caused
prayers and incantations to be repeated over it, and having had it made
into three strands, which they call <i>sih tan</i>, by one in whom they
have confidence, they fasten it on his waist. Having woven a
<i>zunn&#257;r</i> (girdle or thread) out of the loose threads, they
hang it over his right<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7433src" href=
"#xd24e7433" name="xd24e7433src">82</a> shoulder. Having given into his
hand a stick of the length of a little over 1 gaz to defend himself
with from hurtful things and a copper vessel for drinking-water, they
hand him over to a learned brahmin that he may remain in his house for
twelve years, and employ himself in reading the Vedas, which they
believe in as God&rsquo;s book. From this day forward they call him a
brahmin. During this time it is necessary that he should altogether
abstain from bodily pleasures. When midday is passed he goes as a
beggar to the houses of other brahmins, and bringing what is given him
to his preceptor, eats it with his permission. For clothing, with the
exception of a loin cloth (<i>lung&#299;</i>) of cotton to cover his
private parts, and 2 or 3 more gaz of cotton <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb358" href="#v1pb358" name=
"v1pb358">358</a>]</span>which he throws over his back, he has nothing
else. This state is called <i>brahmacharya</i>, that is, being busied
with the Divine books. After this period has passed, with the leave of
his preceptor and his father, he marries, and is allowed to enjoy all
the pleasures of his five senses until the time when he has a son who
shall have attained the age of 16 years. If he does not have a son, he
passes his days till he is 48 in the social life. During this time they
call him a <i>grihast</i>, that is, householder. After that time,
separating himself from relatives, connections, strangers, and friends,
and giving up all things of enjoyment and pleasure, he retires to a
place of solitude from the place of attachment to sociality
(<i>ta&#703;alluq-i-&#257;b&#257;d-i-kas&#804;rat</i>), and passes his
days in the jungle. They call this condition
<i>b&#257;nprasta</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7454src" href=
"#xd24e7454" name="xd24e7454src">83</a> that is, abode in the jungle.
As it is a maxim of the Hindus that no good deed can be thoroughly
performed by men in the social state without the partnership of the
presence of a wife, whom they have styled the half of a man, and as a
portion of the ceremonies and worshippings is yet before him (has to be
accomplished), he takes his wife with him into the jungle. If she
should be pregnant, he puts off his going until she bear a child and it
arrive at the age of 5 years. Then he entrusts the child to his eldest
son or other relation, and carries out his intention. In the same way,
if his wife be menstruous, he puts off going until she is purified.
After this he has no connection with her, and does not defile himself
with communication with her, and at night he sleeps apart.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7457src" href="#xd24e7457" name=
"xd24e7457src">84</a> He passes twelve years in this place, and lives
on vegetables which may have sprung up of themselves in the desert and
jungle. He keeps his zunnar by him and worships fire. He does not waste
his time in looking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb359" href=
"#v1pb359" name="v1pb359">359</a>]</span>after his nails or the hair of
his head, or in trimming his beard and moustaches. When he completes
this period in the manner related, he returns to his own house, and
having commended his wife to his children and brothers and sons-in-law,
goes to pay his respects to his spiritual guide, and burns by throwing
into the fire in his presence whatever he has in the way of a zunnar,
the hair of his head, etc., and says to him: &ldquo;Whatever attachment
(<i>ta&#703;alluq</i>) I may have had, even to abstinence and
worshipping and will, I have rooted up out of my heart.&rdquo; Then he
closes the road to his heart and to his desires and is always employed
in contemplation of God, and knows no one except the True Cause of
Being (God). If he speak of science it is the science of Ved&#257;nta,
the purport of which B&#257;b&#257; Fig&#863;h&#257;n&#299; has
versified in this couplet&mdash;</p>

the place where the royal camp was pitched. On the 3rd day, which was a
halting day, I went, from desire for association with him, after
midday, to see Jadr&#363;p, and for six gharis enjoyed myself in his
company. On this day also he uttered good words, and it was near
evening when I entered my palace. On the 4th day I journeyed 3&frac14;

also a very pleasant halting-place, full of trees. On the 6th there was
a march; after proceeding for 4&frac34; kos I halted on the bank of the
lake of Deb&#257;lp&#363;r Bheriy&#257;. On account of the pleasantness
of the place and the delights of the lake, I halted at this stage for
four days, and at the end of each day, embarking in a boat, employed
myself in shooting ducks (<i>murg&#863;h&#257;b&#299;</i>) and other
aquatic animals. At this halting-place they brought
<i>fak&#863;hr&#299;</i> grapes from Ahmadnagar. Although they are not
as large as the Kabul fakhri grapes, they do not yield to them in
sweetness.</p>
<p class="par">At the request of my son B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram
the mansab of Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, son of M&#299;rz&#257;

On the 11th I marched, and after proceeding for 3&frac14; kos halted in
the parganah Daulatabad. On the 12th, which was a halt, I rode out to
hunt. In the village of S&#863;haik&#863;h&#363;p&#363;r, which
belonged to the said parganah, I saw a very large and bulky
banyan-tree, measuring round its trunk 18&frac12; gaz, and in height
from the root to the top of the branches 128&frac14; cubits. The
branches spread a shade for 203&frac12; cubits. The length of a branch,
on which they have represented the tusks of an elephant, was 40 gaz. At
the time when my revered father passed by this, he had made an
impression of his hand by way of a mark at the height of 3&frac34; gaz
from the ground. I ordered them also to make the mark of my hand 8 gaz
above another root. In order that these two hand-marks might not be
effaced in the course of time, they were carved on a piece of marble
and fastened on to the trunk of the tree. I ordered them to place a
<i>chab&#363;tara</i> and platform round the tree.</p>
<p class="par">As at the time when I was prince I had promised M&#299;r
Z&#803;iy&#257;&#702;u-d&#299;n Qazw&#299;n&#299;, who was one of the

<i>&#257;l tamg&#863;h&#257;</i> (perpetual royal grant), this great
gift was bestowed in his honour at this halting-place. On the 13th a
march took place. Going separately from this camp to look round the
country and hunt with some of the ladies and intimates and servants, I
proceeded to the village of H&#803;&#257;&#7779;ilp&#363;r, and whilst
the camp was pitched in the neighbourhood of N&#257;lcha
(B&#257;lchha?) I halted at the village of S&#257;ngor. What shall be
written of the beauty and sweetness of this village? There were many
mango-trees, and its lands were altogether green and delightful. On
account of its greenness and pleasantness I halted here for three days.
I gave this village to Kam&#257;l K&#863;h&#257;n, the huntsman, in
place of Kes&#863;ho D&#257;s M&#257;r&#363;. An order was passed that
they should hereafter call it Kam&#257;lp&#363;r. At this same
halting-place occurred the night of S&#863;h&#299;vr&#257;t
(Shivr&#257;tri). Many Jogis collected. The ceremonies of this night
were duly observed, and I met the learned of this body in social
intercourse. In these days I shot three blue bulls. The news of the
killing of R&#257;ja M&#257;n reached me at this place. I had appointed
him to head the army that had been sent against the fort of
K&#257;ng&#7771;&#257;. When he arrived at Lahore he heard that
Sangr&#257;m, one of the zamindars of the hill-country of the Panjab,
had attacked his place and taken possession of part of his province.
Considering it of the first importance to drive him out, he went
against him. As Sangr&#257;m had not the power to oppose him, he left
the country of which he had taken possession and took refuge in
difficult hills and places. R&#257;ja M&#257;n pursued him there, and
in his great pride, not looking to the means by which he himself could
advance and retreat, came up to him with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb362" href="#v1pb362" name="v1pb362">362</a>]</span>a small force.
When Sangr&#257;m saw that he had no way to flee by, in accordance with
this couplet&mdash;</p>

<p class="par first">A fight took place, and according to what was
decreed, a bullet struck R&#257;ja M&#257;n and he delivered his soul
to the Creator thereof. His men were defeated and a great number of
them killed. The remainder, wounded, abandoned their horses and arms,
and with a hundred alarms escaped half-dead.</p>
<p class="par">On the 17th I marched from S&#257;ngor, and after
proceeding 3 kos came again to the village of
H&#803;&#257;&#7779;ilp&#363;r. On the road a blue bull was killed.
This village is one of the noted places in the Subah of Malwa. It has
many vines and mango-trees without number. It has streams flowing on
all sides of it. At the time I arrived there were grapes contrary to
the season in which they are in the Wil&#257;yat (Persia or
Afghanistan). They were so cheap and plentiful that the lowest and
meanest could get as much as they desired. The poppy had flowered and
showed varied colours. In brief, there are few villages so pleasant.
For three days more I halted in this village. Three blue bulls were
killed with my gun. From H&#803;&#257;&#7779;ilp&#363;r on the 21st in
two marches I rejoined the big camp. On the road a blue bull was
killed. On Sunday, the 22nd, marching from the neighbourhood of
N&#257;lcha (B&#257;lchha?), I pitched at a lake that is at the foot of
the fort of M&#257;nd&#363;. On that day the huntsmen brought news that
they had marked down a tiger within 3 kos. Although it was Sunday, and
on these two days, viz. Sunday and Thursday, I do not shoot, it
occurred to me that as it is a noxious animal it ought to be done away
with. I proceeded towards him, and when I arrived at the place it was
sitting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb363" href="#v1pb363" name=
"v1pb363">363</a>]</span>under the shade of a tree. Seeing its mouth,
which was half open, from the back of the elephant, I fired my gun. By
chance it entered its mouth and found a place in its throat and brain,
and its affair was finished with that one shot. After this the people
who were with me, although they looked for the place where the tiger
was wounded, could not find it, for on none of its limbs was there any
sign of a gunshot wound. At last I ordered them to look in its mouth.
From this it was evident that the bullet had entered its mouth and that
it had been killed thereby. M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam had killed a male
wolf and brought it. I wished to see whether its gall-bladder was in
its liver like that of the tiger, or like other animals outside its
liver. After examination it was clear that the gall-bladder was also
inside the liver. On Monday, the 23rd, when one watch had passed in a
fortunate ascension and a benign hour, I mounted an elephant and
approached the fort of M&#257;nd&#363;. When a watch and three gharis
of day had passed, I entered the houses which they had prepared for the
royal accommodation. I scattered 1,500 rupees on the way. From Ajmir to
M&#257;nd&#363;, 159 kos, in the space of four months and two days, in
forty-six marches and seventy-eight halts, had been traversed. In these
forty-six marches our halts were made on the banks of tanks or streams
or large rivers in pleasant places which were full of trees and
poppy-fields in flower, and no day passed that I did not hunt while
halting or travelling. Riding on horseback or on an elephant I came
along the whole way looking about and hunting, and none of the
difficulties of travelling were experienced; one might say that there
was a change from one garden to another. In these huntings there were
always present with me &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, M&#299;rz&#257;
Rustam, M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n, An&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299;,
Hid&#257;yatu-llah, R&#257;ja S&#257;rang Deo, Sayyid K&#257;s&#363;,
and K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K&#863;h&#257;n. As before the
arrival of the royal standards in these <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb364" href="#v1pb364" name="v1pb364">364</a>]</span>regions I had
sent &#703;Abdu-l-Kar&#299;m, the architect, to look to the repair of
the buildings of the old rulers in M&#257;nd&#363;, he during the time
the camp halted at Ajmir had repaired some of the old buildings that
were capable of repair, and had altogether rebuilt some places. In
short, he had made ready a house the like of which for pleasantness and
sweetness has probably not been made anywhere else. Nearly 300,000
rupees, or 2,000 Persian tumans, were expended on this. There should be
such grand buildings in all great cities as might be fit for royal
accommodation. This fort is on the top of a hill 10 kos in
circumference; in the rainy season there is no place with the fine air
and pleasantness of this fort. At nights, in the season of the
<i>qalbu-l-asad</i> (Cor leonis of Regulus, the star <span class=
"trans" title="a"><span class="Greek" lang="grc">&alpha;</span></span>
of Leo), it is so cold that one cannot do without a coverlet, and by
day there is no need for a fan (<i>b&#257;d-zan</i>). They say<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7557src" href="#xd24e7557" name=
"xd24e7557src">89</a> that before the time of R&#257;ja
Bikram&#257;j&#299;t there was a Raja of the name of Jai Singh Deo. In
his time a man had gone into the fields to bring grass. While he was
cutting it, the sickle he had in his hand appeared to be of the colour
of gold. When he saw that his sickle had been transmuted, he took it to
a blacksmith of the name of M&#257;dan<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7560src" href="#xd24e7560" name="xd24e7560src">90</a> to be
repaired. The blacksmith knew the sickle had been turned into gold. It
had before this been heard that there was in this country the
alchemist&rsquo;s stone (<i>sang-i-p&#257;ras</i>), by contact with
which iron and copper became gold. He immediately took the grass-cutter
with him to that place and procured the stone. After this he brought to
the Raja of the time this priceless jewel. The Raja by means of this
stone made gold, and spent part of it on the buildings of this fort
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb365" href="#v1pb365" name=
"v1pb365">365</a>]</span>and completed them in the space of twelve
years. At the desire of that blacksmith he caused them to cut into the
shape of an anvil most of the stones that were to be built into the
wall of the fort. At the end of his life, when his heart had given up
the world, he held an assembly on the bank of the Narbada, which is an
object of worship among the Hindus, and, assembling brahmins, made
presents to each of cash and jewels. When the turn of a brahmin came
who had long been associated with him, he gave this stone into his
hand. He from ignorance became angry and threw the priceless jewel into
the river. After he came to know the true state of the affair he was a
captive to perpetual sorrow. However much he searched, no trace of it
was found. These things are not written in a book; they have been
heard, but my intelligence in no way accepts this story. It appears to
me to be all delusion. M&#257;nd&#363;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7574src" href="#xd24e7574" name="xd24e7574src">91</a> is one of
the famous Sarkars of the Subah of Malwa. Its revenue is 1,390,000
dams. It was for a long time the capital of the kings of this country.
There are many buildings and traces of former kings in it, and up till
now it has not fallen into ruin.</p>
<p class="par">On the 24th I rode to go round and see the buildings of
the old kings, and went first to the J&#257;mi&#703; mosque, which is
one built by Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#363;s&#863;hang
G&#863;h&#363;r&#299;. A very lofty building came to view, all of cut
stone, and although 180 years have passed since the time of its
building, it is as if the builder had just withdrawn his hand from it.
After this I went to the building containing the tombs of the
K&#863;halj&#299; rulers. The grave of Na&#7779;&#299;ru-d-d&#299;n,
son of Sult&#804;&#257;n G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n, whose
face is blackened for ever, was also there. It is well known that that
wretch advanced himself by the murder of his own father,
G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n, who was in his 80th year. Twice
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb366" href="#v1pb366" name=
"v1pb366">366</a>]</span>he gave him poison, and he twice expelled it
by means of a <i>zahr-muhra</i> (poison antidote, bezoar) he had on his
arm. The third time he mixed poison in a cup of sherbet and gave it to
his father with his own hand, saying he must drink it. As his father
understood what efforts he was making in this matter, he loosened the
zahr-muhra from his arm and threw it before him, and then turning his
face in humility and supplication towards the throne of the Creator,
who requires no supplication, said: &ldquo;O Lord, my age has arrived
at 80 years, and I have passed this time in prosperity and happiness
such as has been attained to by no king. Now as this is my last time, I
hope that Thou wilt not seize Na&#7779;&#299;r for my murder, and that
reckoning my death as a thing decreed Thou wilt not avenge it.&rdquo;
After he had spoken these words, he drank off that poisoned cup of
sherbet at a gulp and delivered his soul to the Creator. The meaning of
his preamble was that he had passed the time of his reign in enjoyment
such as has not been attained to by any of the kings. When in his 48th
year he came to the throne, he said to his intimates and those near
him, &ldquo;In the service of my revered father I have passed thirty
years in warfare and have committed no fault in my activity as a
soldier; now that my turn to reign has arrived, I have no intention to
conquer countries, but desire to pass the remainder of my life in ease
and enjoyment.&rdquo; They say that he had collected 15,000 women in
his harem. He had a whole city of them, and had made it up of all
castes, kinds, and descriptions&mdash;artificers, magistrates, qazis,
kotwals, and whatever else is necessary for the administration of a
town. Wherever he heard of a virgin possessed of beauty, he would not
desist (lit. did not sit down from his feet) until he possessed her. He
taught the girls all kinds of arts and crafts, and was much inclined to
hunt. He had made a deer park and collected all kinds of animals in it.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb367" href="#v1pb367" name=
"v1pb367">367</a>]</span>He often used to hunt in it with his women. In
brief, in the period of thirty-two years of his reign, as he had
determined, he went against no enemy, and passed this time in ease and
enjoyment. In the same way no one invaded his country. It is reported
that when S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n, the Afghan, in the time of
his rule, came to the tomb of Na&#7779;&#299;ru-d-d&#299;n, he, in
spite of his brutish nature, on account of
Na&#7779;&#299;ru-d-d&#299;n&rsquo;s shameful conduct, ordered the head
of the tomb to be beaten with sticks. Also when I went to his tomb I
gave it several kicks, and ordered the servants in attendance on me to
kick the tomb. Not satisfied with this, I ordered the tomb to be broken
open and his impure remains to be thrown into the fire. Then it
occurred to me that since fire is Light, it was a pity for the Light of
Allah to be polluted with burning his filthy body; also, lest there
should be any diminution of torture for him in another state from being
thus burnt, I ordered them to throw his crumbled bones, together with
his decayed limbs, into the Narbada. During his lifetime he always
passed his days in the water in consequence of the heat that had
acquired a mastery over his temperament. It is well known that in a
state of drunkenness he once threw himself into one of the basins at
K&#257;liy&#257;daha, which was very deep. Some of the attendants in
the harem exerted themselves and caught his hair in their hands and
drew him out of the water. After he had come to his senses they told
him that this thing had happened. When he had heard that they had
pulled him out by the hair of his head, he became exceedingly angry,
and ordered the hands of the attendants to be cut off. Another time,
when an affair of this kind took place, no one had the boldness to pull
him out and he was drowned. By chance, after 110 years had passed since
his death, it came to pass that his decayed limbs also became mingled
with the water. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb368" href="#v1pb368"
name="v1pb368">368</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">On the 28th, as a reward for the buildings of
M&#257;nd&#363; having been completed through his excellent exertions,
I promoted &#703;Abdu-l-Kar&#299;m to the rank of 800 personal and 400
horse, and dignified him with the title of Ma&#703;m&#363;r
K&#863;h&#257;n (the architect-K&#863;h&#257;n). On the same day that
the royal standards entered the fort of M&#257;nd&#363;, my son of
lofty fortune, Sult&#804;&#257;n K&#863;hurram, with the victorious
army, entered the city of Burhanpur, which is the seat of the governor
of the province of Khandesh.</p>
<p class="par">After some days, representations came from Afz&#803;al
K&#863;h&#257;n and the R&#257;y R&#257;y&#257;n, to whom at the time
of leaving Ajmir my son had given leave to accompany the ambassador to
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, reporting that when the news of our
coming reached &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n he came out for 7 kos to
meet the order and the litter of the prince, and performed the duties
of salutation and respect which are customary at Court. He did not omit
a hair&rsquo;s point of such ceremonies. At the same interview he
professed the greatest loyalty, and promised that he would restore all
those provinces that &#703;Ambar of dark fate had taken from the
victorious State, and agreed to send to the Court with all reverence a
fitting offering with his ambassadors. After saying this he brought the
ambassadors in all dignity to the place that had been prepared for
them. On the same day he sent some one to &#703;Ambar with a message of
the matters it was necessary to acquaint him with. I heard this news
from the reports of Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n and the R&#257;y
R&#257;y&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">From Ajmir up to Monday, the 23rd of the
aforesaid<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7594src" href="#xd24e7594" name=
"xd24e7594src">92</a> month, during four months, 2 tigers, 27 blue
bulls, 6 <i>ch&#299;tal</i> (spotted deer), 60 deer, 23 hares and
foxes, and 1,200 water-fowl and other animals had been killed. On these
nights I told the story of my former hunting expeditions and the liking
I had for this occupation to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb369"
href="#v1pb369" name="v1pb369">369</a>]</span>those standing at the
foot of the throne of the Caliphate. It occurred to me that I might
make up the account of my game from the commencement of my years of
discretion up to the present time. I accordingly gave orders to the
news-writers, the hunt-accountants and huntsmen, and others employed in
this service to make enquiries and tell me of all the animals that had
been killed in hunting. It was shown that from the commencement of my
12th year, which was in 988 (1580), up to the end of this year, which
is the 11th year after my accession and my 50th lunar year, 28,532 head
of game had been taken in my presence. Of these, 17,167 animals I
killed myself with my gun or otherwise, viz.: Quadrupeds, 3,203; viz.,
tigers, 86; bears, cheetahs, foxes, otters (<i>&#363;dbil&#257;o</i>),
and hy&aelig;nas, 9; blue bulls, 889; <i>mh&#257;ka</i>, a species of

&ldquo;It is a pity that no trace of these is left at Agra. Had there

been supposed to have been put up by Akbar and to represent Chitor
heroes. The word <i>tark&#299;b</i> in the text may mean that they were

has <i>g&#363;sfand-i-nar</i>, &lsquo;a ram,&rsquo; but the MSS. have
<i>g&#363;sfand u bar</i>, or buz, and it is evident that the true
reading is &lsquo;a sheep, a goat.&rsquo; See Blochmann, p. 266, where
goats are mentioned among the animals distributed by Akbar. The number
of animals distributed corresponded with the years of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s age (48) multiplied by 3, and so would be 48
&times; 3 = 144 (see Blochmann, l.c.). The weight of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
was 6,514 tulchas, and Blochmann (p. 267, n.) takes this to be the same
as tolas, and estimates Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s weight at
210&frac12; lb. troy or 15 stone. Probably this is excessive, and his
weight might be 82 sir or about 2 maunds, i.e. 164 lb. or 11&frac12;
stone. The perfumes against which he was weighed were ambergris, not
amber (which has no scent), <i>&#703;&#363;d</i>, i.e. lignum aloes,
and <i>b&#257;n</i> (not <i>p&#257;n</i> as in text), which apparently
is the same as <i>lub&#257;n</i>, &lsquo;frankincense&rsquo; (see the
chapter on perfumes in Blochmann, p. 77). I am not sure of the meaning
of the phrase <i>ba-dast nih&#257;da</i>. The MSS. have not the
preposition <i>ba</i>. Perhaps the meaning is &lsquo;put them into the
hands of the fakirs.&rsquo; Jah&#257;ng&#299;r was born on the 18th
S&#863;hahr&#299;war, 977 = 31st August, 1569. The weighings described
in the text took place on the 26th S&#863;hahr&#299;war. Perhaps this
was because his birthday was on the 24th S&#863;hahr&#299;war according
to the Jal&#257;l&#299; year.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

By the latter part of the sentence Jah&#257;ng&#299;r means that

Evidently the four-horned antelope, the <i>Tetracerus quadricornis</i>
of Blanford, p. 520, and which has the Hindustani name of <i>doda</i>.
Blanford describes its colour as dull pale brown. &ldquo;The posterior
horns are much larger than the anterior ones, which are situated
between the orbits and are often mere knobs. It is the only Indian
representative of the <i>duikarbok</i> of Africa. Another Indian name
is <i>chausingha</i>. In jungle this species and the hog-deer may
easily be mistaken the one for the other. It is not gregarious, and
moves with a peculiar jerky action.&rdquo; The resemblance between the
four-horned antelope and the hog-deer&mdash;the <i>k&#363;t&#257;h
p&#257;ycha</i> or short-legged deer of B&#257;bar and
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&mdash;may account for Blanford&rsquo;s giving
<i>doda</i> as a native name for the hog-deer (<i>Cervus porcinus</i>).
For B&#257;bar&rsquo;s description of the <i>k&#363;t&#257;h
p&#257;ya</i> or <i>p&#257;ycha</i> see Erskine, p. 317. Gladwin in his
history of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r writes the native name as
<i>Dirdhayan</i>.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

&lsquo;one,&rsquo; before the word <i>s&#863;h&#257;k&#863;h</i> is not
in the MSS. and is, I think, wrong. I think the 16 gaz and 15&frac12;

Erskine takes this to show that B&#257;bar was writing in 934, and if

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One ghari of day remained of Monday, the 30th of
the aforesaid (Isfand&#299;y&#257;r) month, corresponding to the 12th
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal, 1026 (20th March, 1617), when the sun changed
from the constellation of Pisces into the pleasure-house of Aries,
which is his abode of honour and good fortune. At the very time of
transit, which was a fortunate hour, I sat upon the throne. I had
ordered that according to the usual custom they should decorate the
public audience hall with fine cloths, etc. Notwithstanding that many
of the Amirs and chief men of the State were in attendance on my son
K&#863;hurram, a meeting was arranged which was not inferior to those
of previous years. I presented the offerings of Tuesday<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7688src" href="#xd24e7688" name="xd24e7688src">1</a>
to &#256;nand K&#863;h&#257;n. On the same day, which was the 1st
Farward&#299;n of the 12th year (21st or 22nd March, 1617) a
representation arrived from S&#863;h&#257;h K&#863;hurram to the effect
that the New Year&rsquo;s festival had been arranged for in the same
manner as in previous years, but as the days of travelling and service
had occurred the annual offerings of the servants would be remitted.
This proceeding of my son was much approved. Remembering my dear son in
my prayers, I besought for him from the throne of Allah his welfare in
both worlds, and ordered that on this New Year&rsquo;s Day no one
should present offerings.</p>
<p class="par">In consequence of the disturbance that tobacco brings
about in most temperaments and constitutions, I had ordered that no one
should smoke it (lit. draw). My brother S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;Abb&#257;s had also become aware of the mischief arising from it,
and had ordered that in Iran no one should venture to smoke. As

was without control in continual smoking of tobacco, he frequently
practised it. Y&#257;dg&#257;r &#703;Al&#299; Sult&#804;&#257;n,
ambassador of the ruler of Iran, represented to S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;Abb&#257;s that K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam could never be a
moment without tobacco, and he (S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s) wrote
this couplet in answer&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="par first">On the 3rd of the same month, H&#803;usain Beg,
the diwan of Bengal, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and
made an offering of twelve elephants, male and female.
T&#804;&#257;hir, bakhshi of Bengal, who had been accused of several
offences, obtained the favour of paying his respects to me, and
presented before me an offering of twenty-one elephants. Twelve of
these were approved and the remainder I conferred on him. On this day a
wine-feast was arranged, and I gave wine to most of the servants who
were engaged in waiting on me, and made them all heated with the wine
of loyalty. On the 4th the huntsmen sent news that they had marked down
a lion in the neighbourhood of the Shakkar<a class="noteref" id=

is inside the fort and one of the famous constructions of the rulers of
Malwa. I at once mounted and went towards that game. When the lion
appeared he charged the ahadis and the retinue and wounded ten<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7715src" href="#xd24e7715" name="xd24e7715src">3</a>

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb372" href="#v1pb372" name=

9th, at the request of my son K&#863;hurram, I increased the mansab of
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n by 1,000 personal and horse, making it thus
6,000 personal and horse; that of Ya&#703;q&#363;b K&#863;h&#257;n,
which was 1,500 personal with 1,000 horse, was made 2,000 personal and
1,500 horse; that of Bahl&#363;l K&#863;h&#257;n Miy&#257;na<a class=

was increased by 500 personal and 300 horse to 1,500 personal and 1,000
horse; and that of M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;harafu-d-d&#299;n
K&#257;s&#863;hg&#863;har&#299;, by whom and his son great bravery had
been shown in the Deccan, was increased to 1,500 personal and 1,000
horse. On the 10th Farward&#299;n, corresponding with the 22nd
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal, 1026, my lunar weighing took place. On this
day two &#703;Iraq horses from my private stable and a dress of honour
were conferred on my son K&#863;hurram and sent to him by Bahr&#257;m
Beg. I increased the mansab of I&#703;tib&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n to
5,000 personal and 3,000 horse. On the 11th, H&#803;usain Beg, of
Tabriz, whom the ruler of Iran had sent to the ruler of Golconda by way
of embassy, as, in consequence of the quarrel of the Franks with the
Persians, the road of the M&#299;r had been closed,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e7730src" href="#xd24e7730" name="xd24e7730src">6</a> waited

(nine-pieces?) of cloth from the Deccan and Gujarat. On the same day an
&#703;Iraq horse from my private stable was bestowed on K&#863;h&#257;n
Jah&#257;n. On the 15th, 1,000 personal were added to the mansab of
M&#299;rz&#257; R&#257;ja Bh&#257;o Singh, raising it to 5,000 personal
and 3,000 horse. On the 17th, 500 horse were added to the mansab of
M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam, and I made it up to 5,000 personal and 1,000
horse; that of S&#257;diq K&#863;h&#257;n was fixed at 1,500 personal
and 700 horse, original and increase; Ir&#257;dat K&#863;h&#257;n in
the same manner was raised to the mansab of 1,500 and <span class=

An&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299; 500 personal and 100 horse were added, and
it was made one of 1,500 personal and 500 horse. Three gharis of
Saturday, the 19th, remained when the beginning of the
<i>s&#863;haraf</i> (day of sun&rsquo;s culmination) occurred, and at
the same time I again took my seat on the throne. Of the thirty-two
prisoners from the army of the rebel &#703;Ambar who had been captured
by the servants of the victorious State in the battle won by
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n and the defeat of that
disastrous man (&#703;Ambar), I had handed one man over to
I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n. The guards who had been appointed to
keep him showed carelessness and let him escape. I was much annoyed at
this, and I forbade I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n to come to wait
on me for three months. As the said prisoner&rsquo;s name and condition
were unknown, he was not caught again, although they showed activity in
the matter. At last I ordered the captain of the guards who had been
careless in keeping him to be capitally punished. I&#703;tiq&#257;d
K&#863;h&#257;n on this day, at the request of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, had the good fortune to pay his respects
to me.</p>
<p class="par">As for a long time no good had been heard of the affairs
of Bengal and of the conduct of Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n, it entered
my mind to send to the Subah of Bengal Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
K&#863;h&#257;n Fath&#803;-jang, who had carried on successfully the
affairs of the Subah of Behar and had brought a diamond mine into the
possession of the State, and to despatch Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n, who had a jagir in the Subah of Allahabad, in his
place to Behar. I sent for Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n to Court. At the
same hour on the auspicious day (the day of culmination) an order was
given that they should write royal farmans to the effect that
<i>saz&#257;wal&#257;n</i> (revenue collectors) should be appointed to
take Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n to Behar and to send
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n Fath&#803;-jang to Bengal.

<p class="par">On the 21st I gave leave to Muh&#803;ammad
Riz&#803;&#257;, ambassador of the ruler of Iran, and bestowed on him
60,000 darbs, equal to 30,000 rupees, with a dress of honour. As an
equivalent to the souvenir (<i>y&#257;d-b&#363;d&#299;</i>) that my
brother S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s had sent to me, I forwarded
with the aforesaid ambassador certain presents of jewelled things which
the rulers of the Deccan had sent, with cloths and rare things of every
kind fit for presentation, of the value of 100,000 rupees. Among these
was a crystal cup that Cheleb&#299;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7766src"
href="#xd24e7766" name="xd24e7766src">9</a> had sent from &#703;Iraq.
The Shah had seen this cup and said to the ambassador that if his
brother (Jah&#257;ng&#299;r) would drink wine out of it and send it to
him it would be a great mark of affection. When the ambassador
represented this, having drunk wine several times out of the cup in his
presence, I ordered them to make a lid and a saucer for it and sent it
along with the presents. The lid was of enamel
(<i>m&#299;n&#257;-k&#257;r&#299;</i>). I ordered the Munshis of
mercurial writing (<i>&#703;Ut&#804;&#257;rid-raqm</i>) to write in due
form an answer to the letter he had brought.</p>
<p class="par">On the 22nd the scouts brought in news of a tiger.
Mounting immediately, I went against the tiger and with three shots I
delivered the people from his wickedness, and himself from the
wickedness of his vile nature. Mas&#299;h&#803;u-z-zam&#257;n produced
before me a cat, and represented that it was a hermaphrodite, and that
in his house it had young ones, and that when it had connection with
another cat, young were born to the latter.</p>
<p class="par">On the 25th the contingent of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah passed before me in review on the plain
under the jharoka. There were 2,000 cavalry well horsed, most of whom
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb375" href="#v1pb375" name=
"v1pb375">375</a>]</span>were Moghuls, 500 foot armed with bows and
guns, and fourteen elephants. The bakhshis reckoned them up and
reported that this force was fully equipped and according to rule. On
the 26th a tigress was killed. On Thursday, the 1st
Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, a diamond that Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n had
sent by runners was laid before me; it weighed 23 <i>surkh</i>, and the
jewellers valued it at 30,000 rupees. It was a diamond of the first
water, and was much approved. I ordered them to make a ring of it. On
the 3rd the mansab of Y&#363;suf K&#863;h&#257;n was, at the request of
B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram, fixed at 1,000 with 1,500 horse and in
the same way the mansabs of several of the Amirs and mansabdars were
increased at his suggestion. On the 7th, as the huntsmen had marked
down four tigers, when two watches and three gharis had passed I went
out to hunt them with my ladies. When the tigers came in sight
N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam submitted that if I would order her she
herself would kill the tigers with her gun. I said, &ldquo;Let it be
so.&rdquo; She shot two tigers with one shot each and knocked over the
two others with four shots. In the twinkling of an eye she deprived of
life the bodies of these four tigers. Until now such shooting was never
seen, that from the top of an elephant and inside of a howdah
(<i>&#703;am&#257;r&#299;</i>) six shots should be made and not one
miss, so that the four beasts found no opportunity to spring or
move.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7787src" href="#xd24e7787" name=
"xd24e7787src">10</a> As a reward for this good shooting I gave her a
pair of bracelets<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7802src" href="#xd24e7802"
name="xd24e7802src">11</a> (<i>pahunch&#299;</i>) of diamonds worth
100,000 rupees and scattered 1,000 ashrafis (over her). On the same day
Ma&#703;m&#363;r K&#863;h&#257;n (the architect-K&#863;h&#257;n)

buildings of the palace there. On the 10th the death of Sayyid
W&#257;ris&#804;, who was faujd&#257;r of the Subah of Oudh, was
reported. On the 12th, as M&#299;r Mah&#803;m&#363;d asked for a
faujd&#257;rship, I dignified him with the title of Tahawwur
K&#863;h&#257;n, and, increasing his mansab, appointed him to the
faujd&#257;rship of some of the parganahs of the Subah of Multan. On
the 22nd, T&#804;&#257;hir, the bakhshi of Bengal, who had been
forbidden to pay his respects, waited upon me and presented his
offerings. Eight elephants were also presented as the offering of
Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of Bengal, and two as that of
S&#863;haik&#863;h Modh&#363;. On the 28th, at the request of
K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n, an order was given for the increase of the
mansab of &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K&#863;h&#257;n by 500. On the
5th K&#863;hurd&#257;d the duty of the Diwanship of Gujarat was given
to M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;usain in supercession of Kes&#863;ho. I
dignified him with the title of Kif&#257;yat K&#863;h&#257;n. On the
8th, Las&#863;hkar K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been appointed bakhshi of
Bangash, came and waited on me; he offered 100 muhrs and 500 rupees.
Some days before this &#362;st&#257;d Muh&#803;ammad N&#257;y&#299;
(flute-player), who was unequalled in his craft, was sent by my son
K&#863;hurram at my summons. I had heard some of his musical
pieces<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7811src" href="#xd24e7811" name=
"xd24e7811src">12</a> (<i>majlis-s&#257;z</i>), and he played a tune
which he had composed for an ode (<i>g&#863;hazal</i>) in my name. On
the 12th I ordered him to be weighed against rupees; this came to 6,300
rupees. I also gave him an elephant with a howdah,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e7820src" href="#xd24e7820" name="xd24e7820src">13</a> and I
ordered him to ride on it and, having packed<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7826src" href="#xd24e7826" name="xd24e7826src">14</a> his rupees
about him, to proceed to his lodging. Mull&#257; Asad, the
story-teller, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb377" href="#v1pb377"
name="v1pb377">377</a>]</span>one of the servants of M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;, came on the same day from Tattah and waited on
me. As he was a reciter and story-teller full of sweetness and
smartness, I liked his society, and I made him happy with the title of
Mah&#803;z&#804;&#363;z&#804; K&#863;h&#257;n, and gave him 1,000
rupees, a dress of honour, a horse, an elephant, and a palanquin. After
some days I ordered him to be weighed against rupees, and his weight
came up to 4,400. He was raised to the mansab of 200 personal and 20
horse. I ordered him always to be present at the meetings for talk
(<i>gap</i>). On the same day Las&#863;hkar K&#863;h&#257;n brought his
men to the <i>dars&#863;han jharoka</i> before me. There were 500
horse, 14 elephants, and 100 musketeers. On the 24th news came that
Mah&#257; Singh, grandson of R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh, who was entered
among the great officers, had died from excessive wine-drinking at
B&#257;l&#257;p&#363;r in the province of Berar. His father also had
died at the age of 32<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7840src" href=
"#xd24e7840" name="xd24e7840src">15</a> from the drinking of wine
beyond measure. On the same day they had brought to my private
fruit-house many mangoes from all parts of the province of the Deccan,
Burhanpur, Gujarat, and the parganahs of Malwa. Although this province
is well known and celebrated for the sweetness, freedom from
stringiness, and size of its mangoes, and there are few mangoes that
equal its mangoes&mdash;so much so that I often ordered them to be
weighed in my presence, when they were shown to come to a seer or
1&frac14; seer or even more&mdash;yet in sweetness of water and
delicious flavour and digestibility the mangoes of
Chapr&#257;mau,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7843src" href="#xd24e7843"
name="xd24e7843src">16</a> in the province of Agra, are superior to all
the mangoes of this province and of all other places in India.</p>
<p class="par">On the 28th I sent for my son B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram a special gold-embroidered <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> of a
fineness such as had never <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb378" href=
"#v1pb378" name="v1pb378">378</a>]</span>been produced before in my
establishment; I ordered the bearer to tell him that as this rarity had
the speciality that I had worn it on the day I quitted Ajmir for the
conquest of the Deccan, I had sent it to him. On the same day I placed
the turban from my own head, just as it was, on the head of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, and honoured him with this favour. Three
emeralds, a piece of jewelled <i>&#363;rbas&#299;</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7857src" href="#xd24e7857" name=
"xd24e7857src">17</a> and a ruby signet ring that Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n had sent by way of offering were laid before me. They
came to 7,000 rupees in value. On this day, by the mercy and favour of
Allah, continued rain fell. Water in M&#257;nd&#363; had become very
scarce and the people were agitated about the matter so that most of
the servants had been ordered to go to the bank of the Narbada. There
was no expectation of rain at that season. In consequence of the
agitation of the people I turned by way of supplication to the throne
of God, and He in His mercy and grace gave such rain that in the course
of a day and a night tanks, ponds (<i>birkah&#257;</i>), and rivers
became full, and the agitation of the people was changed to complete
ease. With what tongue can I render thanks for this favour? On the 1st
of T&#299;r a standard was presented to Waz&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n. The
offering of the R&#257;n&#257;, consisting of two horses, a piece of
Gujarati cloth, and some jars of pickles and preserves, was laid before
me. On the 3rd, Mu&#703;azz&#257;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7869src"
href="#xd24e7869" name="xd24e7869src">18</a>(?) brought news of the
capture of &#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f, a descendant of the rulers of
Gujarat, who had always been the originator of mischief and disturbance
in that Subah. As his capture was a reason for the contentment of the
people, praise was given to God, and I ordered Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n
to send him to Court <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb379" href=
"#v1pb379" name="v1pb379">379</a>]</span>by one of his mansabdars. Many
of the zamindars in the neighbourhood of M&#257;nd&#363;, came and
waited on me, and laid offerings before me. On the 8th, R&#257;m
D&#257;s, son of R&#257;ja R&#257;j Singh Kachhw&#257;ha, was given the
<i>&#7789;&#299;ka</i> of a Raja, and I honoured him with that title.
Y&#257;dg&#257;r Beg, who was known in M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr
(Transoxiana) as Y&#257;dg&#257;r Q&#363;rch&#299;, and had not been
without connection and influence with the ruler of that country, came
and waited on me. Of all his offerings a white china cup on a stand was
the most approved. The offering of Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n,
governor of Qandahar, consisting of nine horses, nine <i>tuq&#363;z</i>
of fine cloth (81 pieces?), two black foxes&rsquo; skins, and other
things, was brought before me. Also on this day the R&#257;ja of
Gadeha, Pem<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7886src" href="#xd24e7886" name=
"xd24e7886src">19</a> Nar&#257;yan, had the good fortune to wait on me,
and made an offering of seven elephants, male and female. On the 10th a
horse and dress of honour were given to Y&#257;dg&#257;r
Q&#363;rch&#299;. On the 13th was the feast of rose-water scattering
(<i>gul&#257;b-p&#257;s&#863;h&#257;n</i>). The rites due to that day
were performed. S&#863;haik&#863;h Maud&#363;d Chis&#863;ht&#299;, one
of the officers of Bengal, was honoured with the title of
Chis&#863;ht&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, and I presented him with a horse.
On the 14th, R&#257;wal Samars&#299; (Samarsim&#803;ha), son of
R&#257;wal &#362;day Singh, zamindar of B&#257;nsw&#257;la, waited on
me; he gave as offering 30,000 rupees, three elephants, a jewelled
<i>p&#257;n-d&#257;n</i> (box for betel), and a jewelled belt. On the
15th nine diamonds which Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n
Fath&#803;-jang, the governor of Behar, had sent along with Muhammad
Beg from the mine, and from the collections of the zamindars of that
place, were laid before me. Of these, one weighed 14&frac12; tanks, and
was of the value of 100,000 rupees. On the same day Y&#257;dg&#257;r
Q&#363;rch&#299; was presented with 14,000 darbs, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb380" href="#v1pb380" name=
"v1pb380">380</a>]</span>and I promoted him to the mansab of 500
personal and 300 horse. I fixed the mansab of T&#257;t&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, <i>bak&#257;wul-beg&#299;</i> (chief steward),
original and increase, at 2,000 personal and 300 horse, and each of his
sons was separately promoted to an increased mansab. At the request of
Prince Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z, I increased the personal mansab
of Waz&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n by 500.</p>
<p class="par">On the 29th, which was the auspicious day of Thursday,
Sayyid &#703;Abdu-llah B&#257;rha, the envoy of my son of good fortune,
B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram, waited on me, and presented a letter from
that son containing news of a victory over the provinces of the Deccan.
All the chiefs, laying the head of duty in the noose of obedience, had
consented to service and humility, and laid before him the keys of
forts and strongholds, especially the fort of Ahmadnagar. In gratitude
for this great favour and beneficence, placing the head of supplication
on the throne of that God who requires no return, I opened my lips in
thankfulness, and, humbling myself, ordered them to beat the drums of
rejoicing. Thanks be to Allah that a territory that had passed out of
hand has come back into the possession of the servants of the
victorious State, and that the seditious, who had been breathing the
breath of rebellion and boasting, have turned towards supplication and
weakness, and become deliverers of properties and payers of tribute. As
this news reached me through N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam, I gave her the
parganah of Boda (&#7788;o&#7693;&#257;?),<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7906src" href="#xd24e7906" name="xd24e7906src">20</a> the revenue
of which is 200,000 rupees. Please God, when the victorious forces
enter the province of the Deccan and its forts, and the mind of my
excellent son K&#863;hurram is satisfied with regard to their
possession, he will bring with the ambassadors such an offering from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb381" href="#v1pb381" name=
"v1pb381">381</a>]</span>the Deccan as no other king of this age has
received. It was ordered that he should bring with him the Amirs who
were to receive jagirs in this Subah, in order that they might have the
honour of waiting on me. They will thereafter get leave to depart, and
the glorious royal standards will return with victory and rejoicing to
the capital of Agra. Some days before the news of this victory reached
me, I took one night an augury from the diwan of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804; as to what would be the end of this affair, and
this ode turned up&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The day of absence and night of parting from the
friend are o&rsquo;er.</p>
<p class="line">I took this augury; the star passed and fulfilment
came.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7916src" href="#xd24e7916"
name="xd24e7916src">21</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par first">When the secret tongue
(<i>lis&#257;nu-l-g&#863;haib</i>) of H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804; showed
such an ending it gave me a strong hope, and accordingly, after
twenty-five days, the news of victory arrived. In many of my desires I
have resorted to the K&#863;hw&#257;ja&rsquo;s diwan, and (generally)
the result has coincided with what I found there. It is seldom that the
opposite has happened.</p>
<p class="par">On the same day I added 1,000 horse to the mansab of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, and raised it to that of 5,000
personal and horse. At the end of the day I went with the ladies to
look round the building of the Haft Manz&#804;ar<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7926src" href="#xd24e7926" name="xd24e7926src">22</a> (seven
storeys), and at the beginning of the evening returned to the palace.
This building was founded by a former ruler of Malwa, Sult&#804;&#257;n
Mah&#803;m&#363;d K&#863;halj&#299;. It has seven storeys, and in each
storey there are four chambers (<i>&#7779;uffa</i>) containing four
windows. The height of this tower (<i>m&#299;n&#257;r</i>) is
54&frac12; cubits, and its circumference 50 yards (<i>gaz</i>). There
are 171 steps from the ground <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb382"
href="#v1pb382" name="v1pb382">382</a>]</span>to the seventh storey. In
going and returning I scattered 1,400 rupees.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7941src" href="#xd24e7941" name="xd24e7941src">23</a></p>
<p class="par">On the 31st I honoured Sayyid &#703;Abdu-llah with the
title of Saif K&#863;h&#257;n, and having exalted him with a dress of
honour, a horse, an elephant, and a jewelled dagger, gave him leave and
sent him to do duty with my son of lofty fortune. I also sent by him a
ruby of the value of more than 30,000 rupees for my son. I did not
regard its value, but as for a long time I used to bind it on my own
head, I sent it him by way of good augury, considering it lucky for
him. I appointed Sult&#804;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d, a son-in-law of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan bakhshi, to be bakhshi and
news-writer of the Subah of Behar, and when he took leave I gave him an
elephant. At the end of the day of Thursday, 5th Amurd&#257;d, I went
with the ladies to see the N&#299;l-kun&#7693;, which is one of the
most<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7946src" href="#xd24e7946" name=
"xd24e7946src">24</a> pleasant places in the fort of Mandu
(M&#257;n&#7693;oga&#7771;h). S&#863;h&#257;h-bud&#257;g&#863;h
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of my revered father&rsquo;s most
considerable Amirs, at the time when he held this province in jagir,
built in this place an exceedingly pleasing and enjoyable building.
Delaying there till two or three gharis of night had passed I returned
to the auspicious palace.</p>
<p class="par">As several indiscretions on the part of
Muk&#863;hli&#7779; K&#863;h&#257;n diwan and bakhshi of the Subah of
Bengal, had come to my ears, I reduced his mansab by 1,000 personal and
200 horse. On the 7th a war (<i>mast&#299;</i>) elephant from among
those sent as offerings by &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, by name
Gaj-r&#257;j, was sent to R&#257;n&#257; Amr Singh. On the 11th, I went
out to hunt and came one stage from the fort. There was excessive rain,
and the mud was such that there was hardly any moving. For the
convenience of the people and the comfort of the animals I gave up
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb383" href="#v1pb383" name=
"v1pb383">383</a>]</span>this undertaking, and passing the day of
Thursday outside, returned on Friday eve. On the same day
Hid&#257;yatu-llah, who is very well suited to carry out the rules and
movements (in travelling) of the headquarters (lit. presence), was
honoured with the title of Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n. In
this rainy season rain fell in such quantities that old men said that
they did not remember such rain in any age. For nearly forty days there
was nothing but cloud and rain, so that the sun only appeared
occasionally. There was so much wind that many buildings, both old and
new, fell down. On the first night there was<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7956src" href="#xd24e7956" name="xd24e7956src">25</a> such rain
and thunder and lightning as has seldom been heard of. Nearly twenty
women and men were killed, and the foundations even of some of the
stone buildings were broken up. No noise is more terrifying than this.
Till the middle of the month was passed, wind and rain increased. After
this they gradually became less. What can be written of the verdure and
self-grown fragrant plants? They covered valley and plain and hill and
desert. It is not known if in the inhabited world there exists another
such place as Mandu for sweetness of air and for the pleasantness of
the locality and the neighbourhood, especially in the rainy season. In
this season, which lasts for months and extends up to the hot weather,
one cannot sleep inside houses without coverlets, and in the day the
temperature is such that there is no need for a fan or for change of
place. All that could be written would still fall short of the many
beauties of the place. I saw two things that I had not seen in any
other place in Hindustan. One was the tree of the wild plantain that
grows in most of the uncultivated places in the fort, and the other the
nest of the wagtail (<i>mam&#363;la</i>), which they call in Persian
the <i>dum-s&#299;cha</i> (tail-wagger). Up till now none of the
hunters had pointed out its nest. By <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb384" href="#v1pb384" name="v1pb384">384</a>]</span>chance in the
building I occupied there was its nest, and it brought out two young
ones.</p>
<p class="par">Three watches of day had passed on Thursday, the 19th,
when I mounted with the ladies in order to go round and see the courts
and buildings on the Shakkar tank, founded by former rulers of Malwa.
As an elephant had not been conferred on I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah on
account of his government of the Panjab, I gave him on the road one of
my private elephants of the name of Jagjot. I remained in this
enchanting place until the evening, and was much delighted with the
pleasantness and greenness of the surrounding open spaces. After
performing my evening prayer and counting my rosary, we returned to our
fixed residence. On Friday an elephant named Ran-b&#257;dal (cloud of
war?), which Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n had sent as
an offering, was brought before me. Having adopted for myself certain
special cloths and cloth-stuffs, I gave an order that no one should
wear the same but he on whom I might bestow them. One was a
<i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> coat that they wear over the <i>qab&#257;</i>
(a kind of outer vest). Its length is from the waist down to below the
thighs, and it has no sleeves. It is fastened in front with buttons,
and the people of Persia call it <i>kurd&#299;</i> (from the country of
the Kurds). I gave it the name of nadiri. Another garment is a
T&#804;&#363;s shawl, which my revered father had adopted as a dress.
The next was a coat (qaba) with a folded collar (<i>bat&#363;
gir&#299;b&#257;n</i>). The ends of the sleeves were embroidered. He
had also appropriated this to himself. Another was a qaba with a
border, from which the fringes of cloth were cut off and sewn round the
skirt and collar and the ends of the sleeve. Another was a qaba of
Gujarati satin, and another a <i>ch&#299;ra</i> and waistbelt woven
with silk, in which were interwoven gold and silver threads.</p>
<p class="par">As the monthly pay of some of Mah&#257;bat

been performed, I gave an order that the civil officers
(<i>d&#299;w&#257;niy&#257;n</i>) should levy the difference from his
jagir. In the end of Thursday, the 26th, corresponding with the 14th
S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n, which is the S&#863;hab-i-bar&#257;t, I held a
meeting in one of the houses of the palace of N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n
Begam, which was situated in the midst of large tanks, and summoning
the Amirs and courtiers to the feast which had been prepared by the
Begam, I ordered them to give the people cups and all kinds of
intoxicating drinks according to the desire of each. Many asked for
cups, and I ordered that whoever drank a cup should sit according to
his mansab and condition. All sorts of roast meats, and fruits by way
of relish, were ordered to be placed before everyone. It was a
wonderful assembly. In the beginning of the evening they lighted
lanterns and lamps all round the tanks and buildings, and a lighting up
was carried out the like of which has perhaps never been arranged in
any place. The lanterns and lamps cast their reflection on the water,
and it appeared as if the whole surface of the tank was a plain of
fire. A grand entertainment took place, and the drinkers of cups took
more cups than they could carry.</p>

<p class="par">After three of four gharis of night had passed, I
dismissed the men and summoned the ladies, and till a watch of night
(remained?) passed the time in this delightful place, and enjoyed
myself. On this day of Thursday several special things had happened.
One was that it was the day of my ascension of the throne; secondly, it
was the S&#863;hab-i-bar&#257;t, thirdly, it was the day of the
<i>r&#257;kh&#299;</i>, which has already been described, and with the
Hindus is a special day. On account of these three pieces of good
fortune I called the day Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba.</p>
<p class="par">On the 27th, Sayyid K&#257;s&#363; was dignified with
the title of Parwaris&#863;h K&#863;h&#257;n. Wednesday in the same way
that Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba had been a fortunate one for me had
fallen out exactly the opposite. On this account I gave this evil day
the name of Kam-s&#863;hamba, in order that this day might always fail
from the world (lessen). On the next day a jewelled dagger was
conferred on Y&#257;dg&#257;r Q&#363;rch&#299;, and I ordered that
after this he should be styled Y&#257;dg&#257;r Beg. I had sent for Jay
Singh, son of R&#257;ja Mah&#257; Singh. On this day he waited on me
and presented an elephant as an offering. A watch and three gharis of
Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba, the 2nd of S&#863;hahriy&#257;r, had passed,
when I rode to look round the N&#299;l-kund and its neighbourhood;
thence I passed on to the plain of the &#703;&#298;d-g&#257;h on the
top of a mound that was very green and pleasant. Champa flowers and
other sweet wild herbs of that plain had bloomed to such a degree that
on all sides on which the eye fell the world looked like a world of
greenery and flowers. I entered the palace when a watch of night had
passed.</p>
<p class="par">As it had been several times mentioned to me that a kind
of sweetmeat was obtained from the wild plantain such that dervishes
and other poor people made it their food, I wished to enquire into the
matter. What I found was that the fruit of the wild plantain was an
exceedingly hard and tasteless thing. The real fact is that in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb387" href="#v1pb387" name=
"v1pb387">387</a>]</span>lower part (of the trunk) there is a thing
shaped like a fir-cone from which the real fruit of the plantain comes
out. On this a kind of sweetmeat forms which has exactly the juiciness
and taste of <i>p&#257;l&#363;da</i>. It appears that men eat this and
enjoy it.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8034src" href="#xd24e8034" name=
"xd24e8034src">28</a></p>
<p class="par">With regard to carrier pigeons
(<i>kab&#363;tar-i-n&#257;ma-bar</i>), it had been stated to me in the
course of conversation that in the time of the Abbaside Caliphs they
taught<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8054src" href="#xd24e8054" name=
"xd24e8054src">29</a> the Baghdad pigeons who were styled
&lsquo;letter-carriers&rsquo; (<i>n&#257;ma-bar</i>), and were one-half
larger<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8063src" href="#xd24e8063" name=
"xd24e8063src">30</a> than the wild pigeon. I bade the pigeon-fanciers
to teach their pigeons, and they taught some of them in such a manner
that we let them fly from Mandu in the early morning, and if there was
much rain they reached Burhanpur by 2&frac12; pahars (watches) of the
day, or even in 1&frac12; pahars. If the air was very clear most of
them arrived by one pahar of the day and some by four gharis (hours) of
the day.</p>
<p class="par">On the 3rd a letter came from B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram, announcing the coming of Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n and
R&#257;y R&#257;y&#257;n and the arrival of the ambassadors of
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, and their bringing suitable offerings
of jewels, jewelled things, elephants, and horses, offerings such as
had never come in any reign or time, and expressing much gratitude for
the services and loyalty of the aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n, and his
faithfulness to his word and duty. He asked for a gracious royal firman
bestowing on him the title of <i>farzand</i> (son) and for other
favours, which had never <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb388" href=
"#v1pb388" name="v1pb388">388</a>]</span>yet been vouchsafed in his
honour. Since it was very gratifying to me to please my son, and his
request was reasonable, I ordered that the Munshis of the mercurial pen
should write a farman in the name of &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n,
conveying every kind of affection and favour, and exceeding in his
praise ten or twelve times what had been previously written. They were
ordered in these farmans to address him as farzand. In the body of the
farman I wrote this couplet with my own hand&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;st become, at S&#863;h&#257;h
K&#863;hurram&rsquo;s request,</p>
<p class="line">Renowned in the world as my son&rdquo;
(<i>farzand&#299;</i>).</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">On the 4th day this farman was sent off with its
copy, so that my son S&#863;h&#257;h K&#863;hurram might see the copy
and send off the original. On Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba, the 9th, I
went with the ladies to the house of &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n.
His house was situated in the valley, and was exceedingly pleasant and
bright. It had several valleys round it; in some places there were
flowing waterfalls, and mango and other trees exceedingly green and
pleasant and shady. Nearly 200 or 300 keora shrubs
(<i>gul-i-keo&#7771;&#257;</i>, <i>Pandanus odoratissimus</i>) grew in
one valley. In fine that day passed in great enjoyment. A wine party
was held and cups were presented to the Amirs and intimates, and an
offering from &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n was laid before me. There
were many rare things. I took whatever I approved, and the remainder
was given to him. On the same day K&#863;hw&#257;ja M&#299;r, son of
Sult&#804;&#257;n K&#863;hw&#257;ja, who had come on a summons from
Bangash, waited on me, and presented as an offering a ruby, two pearls,
and an elephant. R&#257;ja Bh&#299;m Nar&#257;yan, a zamindar of the
province of Gadeha, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and
500 horse. An order was given that a jagir should be provided him out
of his native country. On the 12th a letter came from my son
K&#863;hurram that R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Mal, son of R&#257;ja
B&#257;so, whose territory is near the fort of Kangra, had promised
that in the course of a year he would <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb389" href="#v1pb389" name="v1pb389">389</a>]</span>bring that fort
into the possession of the servants of the victorious State. He also
sent his letter which covenanted for this. I ordered that after
comprehending his desires and wishes, and satisfying himself with
regard to them, he should send off the Raja to wait on me, so that he
might set about the said duty. On the same day, which was Monday, the
11th, corresponding with the 1st Ramaz&#803;&#257;n (2nd September,
1617), after four gharis and seven pals had passed, a daughter was born
to my son by the mother of his other children, who was the daughter of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n. This child was named
R&#363;s&#863;han&#257;r&#257; Begam. As the Zamindar of Jaitp&#363;r,
which is in the jurisdiction<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8100src" href=
"#xd24e8100" name="xd24e8100src">31</a> of Mandu, in consequence of
wickedness had not had the felicity of kissing the threshold I ordered
Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n to proceed against him with some
mansabdars and 400 or 500 musketeers and plunder his country. On the
13th one elephant was given to Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n
and one to M&#299;r Q&#257;sim, son of Sayyid Mur&#257;d. On the 16th
Jay Singh, son of R&#257;ja Mah&#257; Singh, who was 12 years old, was
promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and horse. To M&#299;r
M&#299;r&#257;n, son of M&#299;r K&#863;hal&#299;lu-llah, I gave an
elephant which I had myself approved, and another to Mull&#257;
&#703;Abdu-s-Satt&#257;r.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8109src" href=
"#xd24e8109" name="xd24e8109src">32</a> Bhoj, son of R&#257;ja
Bikram&#257;j&#299;t Bhadauriy&#257;, after his father&rsquo;s death,
came from the Deccan and waited on me, and presented 100 muhrs as an
offering. On the 17th it was represented that R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n had
come from the province of Orissa, and proposed to kiss my threshold. As
some unpleasant stories had been told with regard to him, an order was
given that they should hand him over with his son to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb390" href="#v1pb390" name=
"v1pb390">390</a>]</span>&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n to enquire
into the truth of what had been said about him. On the 19th an elephant
was given to Jay Singh. On the 20th 200 horses were added to the mansab
of Kes&#863;ho D&#257;s M&#257;r&#363;, so that it came, original and
increase, to 2,000 personal and 1,200 horse. On the 23rd, having
distinguished Allah-d&#257;d, the Afghan, with the title of
Ras&#863;h&#299;d K&#863;h&#257;n, I gave him a <i>parm-narm</i>
(shawl). The offering of R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n Singh, consisting of
eighteen elephants, was brought before me; sixteen elephants were
included in my private elephant stud, and I presented him with two. As
the news had arrived from Iraq of the death of the mother of M&#299;r
M&#299;r&#257;n, daughter of S&#863;h&#257;h Isma&#703;&#299;l II, of
the race of the &#7778;afaw&#299; kings, I sent him a dress of honour
and brought him out of the robes of mourning. On the 25th
Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n received a dress of honour, and,
in company with his brother R&#363;hu-llah and other mansabdars,
obtained leave to go to punish the Zamindar of Jaitpur. On the 28th,
having come down from the fort with the intention of seeing the Narbada
and to hunt in its neighbourhood, I took the ladies with me and halted
two stages down on the bank of the river. As there were many mosquitoes
and fleas, I did not stay more than one night. Having come the next day
to T&#257;r&#257;p&#363;r I returned on Friday, the 31st. On the 1st of
the month of Mihr, Muh&#803;sin K&#863;hw&#257;ja, who at this time had
come from Transoxiana, received a dress of honour and 5,000 rupees. On
the 2nd, after enquiry into the matters of R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n, with
regard to which a report had been received, and which &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n had been appointed to investigate, as he appeared
innocent, he enjoyed the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and
presented as an offering 100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees. His offering of a
string of pearls, consisting of eighty pearls and two rubies with a
bracelet with a ruby and two pearls, and the golden figure of a horse
studded with jewels, was laid before <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb391" href="#v1pb391" name="v1pb391">391</a>]</span>me. A petition
from Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n arrived stating that when
the victorious army entered the province of Jaitpur the zamindar had
elected to run away. He could not oppose Fid&#257;&#702;&#299;, and his
country was ravaged. He now repented of what he had done, and intended
to come to the Court, which was the asylum of the world, and proffer
service and obedience. A force with R&#363;h&#803;u-llah was sent in
pursuit of him to capture and bring him to Court, or to lay waste and
ruin his domain and imprison his women and dependants, who had gone
into the country of the neighbouring zamindars. On the 8th
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Niz&#804;&#257;m came and laid before me fourteen
pomegranates from the port of Muk&#863;h&#257; (Mocha), which they had
brought to Surat in the space of fourteen days, and in eight days more
to Mandu. The size of these was the same as that of the Thatta
pomegranates. Though the pomegranates of Thatta are seedless and these
have seeds,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8120src" href="#xd24e8120" name=
"xd24e8120src">33</a> yet they are delicate, and in freshness excel
those of Thatta. On the 9th news came that while R&#363;h&#803;u-llah
was passing through the villages, he came to know that the women and
dependants of the Jaitp&#363;r&#299; zamindar were in a certain
village. He remained outside, and sent men into the village to make
enquiries and to bring out the persons who were there. Whilst he was
making enquiries, one of the devoted servants of the zamindar came
along with the villagers. Whilst his men were scattered here and there,
and R&#363;h&#803;u-llah with some servants had brought out his
furniture and was sitting on a carpet, that devoted servant came behind
him and struck him with a spear; the blow was fatal and the spearhead
came out at his breast. The pulling out of the spear and the
reverting<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8126src" href="#xd24e8126" name=
"xd24e8126src">34</a> to his original (dying) of R&#363;h&#803;u-llah
took place together. Those who were present sent that wretch to hell.
All the men who had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb392" href=
"#v1pb392" name="v1pb392">392</a>]</span>scattered about put on their
armour and attacked the village. Those doomed men
(<i>k&#863;h&#363;n-giriftah&#257;</i>) had the disgrace of
harbouring<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8138src" href="#xd24e8138" name=
"xd24e8138src">35</a> rebels and sedition-mongers, and were killed in
the course of an astronomical hour. They brought into captivity their
wives and daughters, and, setting fire to the village, made it so that
nothing was seen but heaps of ashes. They then lifted up the body of
R&#363;h&#803;u-llah and went and joined Fid&#257;&#702;&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n. With regard to the bravery and zeal of
R&#363;h&#803;u-llah, there was no dispute; at the most, his
carelessness brought about this turn of fortune. No traces of
habitation remained in that region; the zamindar of that place went
into the hills and jungles and concealed and obliterated himself. He
then sent someone to Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n and begged
for pardon for his offences. An order was given that he should be
allowed quarter and brought to Court.</p>
<p class="par">The mansab of Muruwwat K&#863;h&#257;n was fixed,
original and increase, at 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, on condition
that he should destroy Harbh&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id=

the 13th R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Mal, together with Taq&#299;, the bakhshi
who was in attendance on B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram, came and waited
on me. He represented all his requirements. His engagement to perform
the work was approved, and at the request of my son he was honoured
with a standard and drums. To Taq&#299;, who had been appointed with
him, a jewelled <i>khapwa</i> (dagger) was given, and it was arranged
that he should finish his own affairs and start off quickly. The mansab
of K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;Al&#299; Beg M&#299;rz&#257;, who had been
appointed to the defence and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb393"

was given to N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299;, K&#863;hw&#257;jag&#299;

mansab of H&#803;&#257;kim Beg was fixed, original and increase, at
1,000 personal and 200 horse. On the same day, after presenting
R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Mal with a dress of honour, an elephant, and a
jewelled khapwa, and Taq&#299; with a dress of honour, I gave them
leave to proceed on duty to Kangra. When those who had been sent by my
son of lofty fortune, S&#863;h&#257;h K&#863;hurram, with the
ambassadors of &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n and his offerings,
arrived at Burhanpur, and my son&rsquo;s mind was completely satisfied
with regard to the affairs of the Deccan, he prayed for the
Subahdarship of Berar, Khandesh, and Ahmadnagar for the
Commander-in-Chief, the Khankhanan, and sent his son
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n, who is really Khankhanan
junior, with 12,000 cavalry to hold possession of the conquered
provinces. Every place and estate were put as jagirs into the hands of
reliable men, and fitting arrangements were made for the government of
the province. He left, out of the troops that were with him, 30,000
horse and 7,000 musketeer infantry, and took with him the remainder,
amounting to 25,000 horse and 2,000 gunners, and set off to wait on me.
On Thursday (Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba), the 20th<a class="noteref" id=

month of Mihr (Divine month), in the twelfth year from my accession,
corresponding with the 11th S&#863;haww&#257;l, 1026 Hijra (12th
October, 1617), after three watches and one ghari had passed, he
entered the fort of Mandu auspiciously and joyfully, and had the honour
of waiting on me. The duration of our separation was 11<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8159src" href="#xd24e8159" name=
"xd24e8159src">38</a> months and 11 days. After he had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb394" href="#v1pb394" name=
"v1pb394">394</a>]</span>performed the dues of salutation and kissing
the ground, I called him up into the jharokha, and with exceeding
kindness and uncontrolled delight rose from my place and held him in
the embrace of affection. In proportion as he strove to be humble and
polite, I increased my favours and kindness to him and made him sit
near me. He presented 1,000 ashrafis and 1,000 rupees as <i>nazar</i>
and the same amount by way of alms. As the time did not allow of his
presenting all his offerings, he now brought before me the elephant
Sarn&#257;k (?) (snake-head?), that was the chief of the elephants of
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s offering, with a casket of
precious stones. After this the bakhshis were ordered to arrange
according to their mansabs the Amirs who had come with my son to pay
their respects. The first who had the honour of audience was
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n. Sending for him above, I selected him for
the honour of kissing my feet. He presented 1,000 muhrs and 1,000
rupees as nazr, and a casket filled with jewels and jewelled things as
an offering (<i>p&#299;s&#863;h-kas&#863;h</i>). What was accepted of
his offering was worth 45,000 rupees. After this &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n kissed the threshold, and presented 100 muhrs as nazr.
Then Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n had the honour of kissing the ground,
and presented an offering of 100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees, with a parcel
(<i>ga&#7789;h&#7771;&#299;</i>)<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8174src"
href="#xd24e8174" name="xd24e8174src">39</a> of precious stones and
jewelled vessels, the value of which was 124,000 rupees. Of these one
ruby weighed 11 miskals; an European brought it last year to sell at
Ajmir, and priced it at 200,000 rupees, but the jewellers valued it at
80,000 rupees. Consequently the bargain did not come off, and it was
returned to him and he took it away. When he came to Burhanpur,

Niz&#804;&#257;mu-l-mulk, and who came on the promise of my son
S&#863;h&#257;h K&#863;hurram and joined the ranks of the loyal, waited
on me in the order of their mansabs. After this the Wakils of
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n had the honour of kissing the ground,
and presented a letter from him. Before this, as a reward for the
conquest of the R&#257;n&#257;, a mansab of 20,000 personal and 10,000
horse was conferred on my son of lofty fortune. When he had hastened to
the capture of the Deccan he had obtained the title of Shah, and now,
in reward for this distinguished service, I gave him a mansab of 30,000
personal and 20,000 horse and bestowed on him the title of
S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n. An order was given that henceforth they
should place a chair in the paradise-resembling assemblies near my
throne for my son to sit upon. This was a special favour for my son, as
it had never been the custom heretofore. A special dress of honour with
a gold-embroidered <i>ch&#257;rqab</i>, with collar, the end of the
sleeves and the skirt decorated with pearls, worth 50,000 rupees, a
jewelled sword with a jewelled <i>pardala</i> (belt), and a jewelled
dagger were bestowed upon him. In his honour I myself came down from
the jharokha and poured over his head a small tray of jewels and a tray
of gold (coins).<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8198src" href="#xd24e8198"
name="xd24e8198src">41</a> Having called Sarn&#257;k elephant to me, I
saw without doubt that what had been heard in its praise and of its
beauty was real. It stood all the tests in size, form, and beauty. Few
elephants are to be seen of such beauty. As it appeared acceptable to
me, I myself mounted (i.e. drove it) and took it into my private
palace, and scattered a quantity of gold coins on its head,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb396" href="#v1pb396" name=

the 24th, R&#257;ja Bharj&#299;v, Zamindar of Bagl&#257;&#7751;a, came
and waited on me. His name is Part&#257;p; every Raja there has been of
that place they call Bharj&#299;v. He has about 1,500 horse in his pay
(<i>maw&#257;jib-k&#863;hw&#257;r</i>), and in time of need he can
bring into the field 3,000 horse. The province of Bagl&#257;&#7751;a
lies between Gujarat, Khandesh, and the Deccan. It has two strong
forts, S&#257;ler and M&#257;ler (Muler), and as M&#257;ler is in the
midst of a populous country he lives there himself. The country of
Bagl&#257;&#7751;a has pleasant springs and running waters. The mangoes
of that region are very sweet and large, and are gathered for nine
months from the beginning of immaturity<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8213src" href="#xd24e8213" name="xd24e8213src">43</a> until the
end. It has many grapes, but not of the best kinds. The aforesaid Raja
does not drop the thread of caution and prudence in dealing with the
rulers of Gujarat, the Deccan, and Khandesh. He has never gone himself
to see any of them, and if any of them has wished to stretch out his
hand to possess his kingdom, he has remained undisturbed through the
support of the others. After the provinces of Gujarat, the Deccan, and
Khandesh came into the possession of the late king (Akbar),
Bharj&#299;v came to Burhanpur and had the honour of kissing his feet,
and after being enrolled among his servants was raised to the mansab of
3,000. At this time, when S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n went to Burhanpur,
he brought eleven elephants as an offering. He came to Court in
attendance on my son, and in accordance with his friendship and service
was dignified with royal favours, and had presented to him a jewelled
sword, an elephant, a horse, and dress of honour. After some days I
conferred on him three rings of jacinth (<i>y&#257;q&#363;t</i>),
diamond, and ruby. On Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba <span class=

Begam prepared a feast of victory for my son S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n, and conferred on him dresses of honour of great price, with
a <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> with embroidered flowers, adorned with rare
pearls, a <i>sarp&#299;ch</i> (turban ornament) decorated with rare
gems, a turban with a fringe of pearls, a waistbelt studded with
pearls, a sword with jewelled <i>pardala</i> (belt), a <i>ph&#363;l
ka&#7789;&#257;ra</i> (dagger), a <i>sada</i> (?) of pearls, with two
horses, one of which had a jewelled saddle, and a special elephant with
two females. In the same way she gave his children and his ladies
dresses of honour, <i>t&#363;quz</i> (nine pieces) of cloth with all
sorts of gold ornaments, and to his chief servants as presents a horse,
a dress of honour, and a jewelled dagger. The cost of this
entertainment was about 300,000 rupees. Presenting on the same day a
horse and dress of honour to &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n and
Sard&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, his brother, I gave them leave to go to
the Sarkar of Kalpi, which had been given them in jagir, and also
dismissed S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n to his jagir, which
was in the Subah of Gujarat, with a dress of honour and an elephant. I
dismissed Sayyid H&#803;&#257;j&#299;, who was a jagirdar of Behar,
with a gift of a horse.</p>
<p class="par">It was frequently reported to me that K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n had become old and weak, so as to be unfit for active duty,
and the Subahs of Kabul and Bangash is a land of disturbance, and to
subdue the Afghans required riding and active movement. Inasmuch as
caution is the condition of rule, I appointed Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n, Subahdar of Kabul and Bangash, giving him a dress of
honour, and promoted K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n to the governorship of
the province of Thatta. Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n
Fath&#803;-jang had sent as an offering from Behar forty-nine
elephants; these were submitted to me. On this day they brought some
<i>s&#333;na-kela</i> (golden plantains, bananas) for me. I had never
eaten such plantains before. In size they are one finger, and are very
sweet and of good flavour; they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb398"
href="#v1pb398" name="v1pb398">398</a>]</span>have no resemblance to
plantains of other descriptions, but are somewhat indigestible, so that
from the two that I ate I experienced heaviness, whilst others say they
can eat as many as seven or eight. Though plantains are really unfit to
eat, yet of all the kinds this is the one fit to eat. This year, up to
the 23rd of the month of Mihr, Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n sent Gujarat
mangoes by post (<i>&#7693;&#257;k-chauk&#299;</i>).</p>
<p class="par">On this date I heard that Muh&#803;ammad
Riz&#803;&#257;, ambassador of my brother S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;Abb&#257;s, gave up the deposit of his life at Agra through the
disease of <i>ish&#257;l</i> (diarrh&oelig;a). I made the merchant
Muh&#803;ammad Q&#257;sim, who had come from my brother, his executor,
and ordered that according to the will he should convey his goods and
chattels to the Shah, so that he might grant them in his own presence
to the heirs of the deceased. Elephants and dresses of honour were
conferred on Sayyid Kab&#299;r and Bak&#863;htar K&#863;h&#257;n,
Wakils of &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n. On
Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba, the 13th &#256;b&#257;n, Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
Qul&#299; Beg, Turkm&#257;n, who is dignified with the title of
J&#257;n-sip&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, came from the Deccan and waited on
me. His father was included among the Amirs of Iran. He had come from
Persia in the time of the late king Akbar, and having a mansab
conferred on him was sent to the Deccan. He was brought up in that
Subah. Although he had been appointed to a duty, yet as my son
S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n came at this time to pay his respects and
represented his sincerity and devotion, I ordered that he should come
post to Court and have the good fortune to wait upon me and then
return. On this day I promoted &#362;d&#257; R&#257;m<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e8257src" href="#xd24e8257" name="xd24e8257src">44</a> to the
rank of 3,000 personal and 1,500 horse. He is a brahmin by caste, and
was much relied on by &#703;Ambar. At the time when
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n went against &#703;Ambar,
&#256;dam K&#863;h&#257;n H&#803;abs&#863;h&#299;, J&#257;d&#363;
R&#257;y, B&#257;b&#363; R&#257;y K&#257;yath, &#362;d&#257; R&#257;m,
and some other Sard&#257;rs of Niz&#804;&#257;mu-l-mulk <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb399" href="#v1pb399" name=
"v1pb399">399</a>]</span>left him and came to
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n. After &#703;Ambar&rsquo;s
defeat they, by the persuasions of &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n and
the deceit of &#703;Ambar, left the right road again and gave up their
loyalty and service. &#703;Ambar took an oath on the Koran to &#256;dam
K&#863;h&#257;n and put him off his guard, and, capturing him
deceitfully, imprisoned him in the fort of Daulatabad, and at last
killed him. B&#257;b&#363; R&#257;y K&#257;yath and &#362;d&#257;
R&#257;m came away and went to the borders of &#703;&#256;dil
K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s dominions, but he would not admit them into his
territory. About that time B&#257;b&#363; R&#257;y K&#257;yath lost his
life (lit. played away the coin of existence) by the deceit of his
intimates, and &#703;Ambar sent a force against &#362;d&#257; R&#257;m.
He fought well and defeated &#703;Ambar&rsquo;s army. But afterwards,
as he could not remain in that country, he threw himself on to the
borders of the royal dominions, and, having got a promise, came with
his family and dependants and entered the service of my son
S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n. That son distinguished him with favours and
kindnesses of all sorts, and made him hopeful by giving him a mansab of
3,000 personal and 1,000 horse, and brought him to Court. As he was a
useful servant, I increased this by 500 horse. I also increased the
mansab of S&#863;h&#257;h-b&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n, who had one of
2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, by 500 more horse, and gave him the
faujd&#257;rship of the Sarkar of S&#257;rangp&#363;r and a part of the
Subah of Malwa. A special horse and elephant were given to
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n. On Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba (Thursday),
the 10th of the month, my son S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n produced his
own offerings&mdash;jewels and jewelled things and fine cloths and
other rare things. These were all laid out in the courtyard of the
jharokha, and arranged together with the horses and elephants adorned
with gold and silver trappings. In order to please him I came down from
the jharokha and looked through them in detail. Among all these there
was a fine ruby they had bought for my son at the port of Goa for
200,000 rupees; its weight was 19&frac12; tanks, or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb400" href="#v1pb400" name=
"v1pb400">400</a>]</span>17 miskals, and 5&frac12; surkhs. There was no
ruby in my establishment over 12 tanks, and the jewellers agreed to
this valuation. Another was a sapphire, among the offerings of
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n; it weighed 6 tanks and 7 surkhs and
was valued at 100,000 rupees. I never before saw a sapphire of such a
size and good colour. Another was the Chamko&#7771;a diamond, also of
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s; its weight was 1 tank and 6
surkhs, which they valued at 40,000 rupees. The name of Chamko&#7771;a
is derived from this, that there is in the Deccan a plant called
<i>s&#257;g-i-chamko&#7771;a</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8268src"
href="#xd24e8268" name="xd24e8268src">45</a> At the time when
Murtaz&#803;&#257; Niz&#804;&#257;mu-l-mulk conquered Berar he had gone
one day with his ladies round to look at the garden, when one of the
women found the diamond in a chamkora vegetable, and took it to
Niz&#804;&#257;mu-l-mulk. From that day it became known as the Chamkora
diamond, and came into the possession of the present Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n during the interregnum
(<i>fatar&#257;t</i>) of Ahmadnagar. Another was an emerald, also among
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s offerings. Although it is from
a new mine, it is of such a beautiful colour and delicacy as I have
never before seen. Again, there were two pearls, one of the weight of
64 surkhs, or 2 miskals and 11 surkhs, and it was valued at 25,000
rupees. The other weighed 16 surkhs, and was of exceeding roundness and
fineness. It was valued at 12,000 rupees. Another was a diamond from
the offerings of Qut&#804;bu-l-mull, in weight 1 tank, and valued at
30,000 rupees. There were 150 elephants, out of which three had gold
trappings, chains, etc., and nine had silver trappings. Though
twenty<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8276src" href="#xd24e8276" name=
"xd24e8276src">46</a> elephants were put into my private stud, five
were very large and celebrated. The first, N&#363;r-bak&#863;ht, which
my son presented on the day of meeting, was worth 125,000 rupees. The
second, Mah&#299;pati,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8279src" href=
"#xd24e8279" name="xd24e8279src">47</a> from the offerings of
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, was valued <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb401" href="#v1pb401" name=
"v1pb401">401</a>]</span>at 100,000 rupees; I gave it the name of
Durjans&#257;l. Another, also from his offerings, was
Bak&#863;ht-buland, and valued at 100,000 rupees; I called it
Gir&#257;n-b&#257;r. Another was Qadd&#363;s K&#863;h&#257;n, and the
fifth was Im&#257;m Riz&#803;&#257;. They were from the offerings of
Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk. Each of the two was valued at 100,000 rupees.
Again, there were 100 Arab and Iraq horses, most of which were good
horses. Of these, three had jewelled saddles. If the private offerings
of my son and those of the rulers of the Deccan were to be written down
in detail, it would be too long a business. What I accepted of his
presents was worth 2,000,000 rupees. In addition to this he gave his
(step-)mother,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8284src" href="#xd24e8284"
name="xd24e8284src">48</a> N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam, offerings worth
200,000 rupees, and 60,000 rupees to his other mothers and the Begams.
Altogether my son&rsquo;s offerings came to 2,260,000 rupees, or 75,000
tumans of the currency of Iran or 6,780,000 current
T&#363;r&#257;n-kh&#257;n&#299;s. Such offerings had never been made
during this dynasty. I showed him much attention and favour; in fact,
he is a son who is worth grace and kindness. I am very pleased and
satisfied with him. May God Almighty allow him to enjoy long life and
prosperity!</p>
<p class="par">As I had never in my life had any elephant-hunting, and
had a great desire to see the province of Gujarat and to look on the
salt sea, and my huntsmen had often gone and seen wild elephants and
fixed on hunting-places, it occurred to me to travel through Ahmadabad
and look on the sea, and having hunted elephants on my return, when it
was hot and the season for hunting them to go back to Agra. With this
intention I despatched to Agra H&#803;az&#803;rat Maryamu-z-zam&#257;n
(his mother) and the other Begams and people of the harem with the
baggage and extra establishments, and betook myself to a tour in the
Subah of Gujarat to hunt, with such as were indispensable <span class=

&#256;b&#257;n (precise date not given, but apparently the 10th), I
marched auspiciously and happily from Mandu, and pitched on the bank of
the tank of N&#257;lchh&#257;. In the morning I went out to hunt and
killed a blue bull with my gun. On the eve of Saturday, Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n was presented with a special horse and an elephant, and
obtained leave to go to his Subah of Kabul and Bangash. At his request
I conferred on Ras&#863;h&#299;d K&#863;h&#257;n a robe of honour, a
horse, an elephant, and a jewelled dagger, and appointed him to assist
him. I promoted Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain to the post of bakhshi
in the Deccan, and M&#299;rak H&#803;usain to that of news-writer in
the same Subah. R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id=

R&#257;ja To&#7693;ar Mal, had come from the Subah of Orissa; on
account of some faults which had been attributed to him he had for some
days been forbidden the honour of paying his respects. After enquiry
his innocence appeared clear, and having given him a dress of honour
and a horse, I appointed him to do duty together with Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n in Bangash. On Monday I gave the Wakils of
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n jewelled turban fringes after the
fashion of the Deccan, one of the value of 5,000 rupees and the other
worth 4,000 rupees. As Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n and R&#257;y
R&#257;y&#257;n had performed the duties of Wakils to my son
S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n in a becoming manner, I raised them both in
mansab and honoured R&#257;y R&#257;y&#257;n with the title of
Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, which among Hindus is the highest title. In truth
he is a servant worthy of patronage. On Saturday, the 12th, I went to
hunt and shot two female nilgaw. As the hunting-ground was a long way
from this halting-place, I on Monday marched 4&frac12; kos<a class=

On Tuesday, the 15th, I killed three blue bulls, the larger one of
which weighed 12 maunds. On this day M&#299;rz&#257; <span class=

fired his gun. Then he reloaded, and as his bullet was very flexible,
he rested the gun on his chest and put the bullet between his teeth in
order that he might contract it and put it right. By chance the match
reached the pan, and his chest at the place where the gun was resting
was burnt to the extent of the palm of the hand, and the grains of
powder got into his skin and flesh and a wound was made, and he
suffered much pain.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8312src" href=

On Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba (Thursday) I went to look round a hill
valley in which there was a waterfall near the camp. At this season it
had but little water, but as for two or three days they had dammed the
watercourse and, about the time of my reaching the place, let it loose,
it flowed over very well. Its height might be 20 <i>gaz</i>. It
separates at the top of the hill and flows down. In this way it is a
great boon (<i>g&#863;han&#299;mat</i>) on the road. Having enjoyed the
usual cups on the edge of the stream and the shade of the hill, I came
back to the camp at night. On this day the Zamindar of Jaitpur, whose
offences I had forgiven at the request of my son S&#863;h&#257;h

H&#803;usain Q&#363;s&#863;h-begi and Y&#257;dg&#257;r
Q&#363;rch&#299;, who had been appointed to do duty in Bangash, with an
elephant each. On this day some H&#803;usain&#299; grapes without seeds
arrived from Kabul; they were very fresh. The tongue of this suppliant
at the throne of God fails in gratitude for the favours by which,
notwithstanding a distance of three months, grapes from Kabul arrive
quite fresh in the Deccan. On Monday, the 21st, three small blue bulls,
on Tuesday, the 22nd, one blue bull and three cows, and on
Kam-s&#863;hamba (Wednesday), the 23rd, one cow, were killed. On
Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba, the 24th, a feast of cups was held on the
bank of the tank of H&#803;&#257;&#7779;ilp&#363;r. Cups were presented
to my son S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n and some of the great Amirs and
private servants. On Y&#363;suf K&#863;h&#257;n, son of H&#803;usain
K&#863;h&#257;n (Tukriyah), who was of the houseborn ones worthy of
patronage, was bestowed the mansab of 3,000 personal and 1,500 horse,
original and increase, and he was dismissed to the faujd&#257;rship of
Gon&#7693;w&#257;na, dignifying him with a gift of a dress of honour
and an elephant. R&#257;y Bih&#257;r&#299; D&#257;s, the diwan of the
Subah of the Deccan, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. On
Friday J&#257;n-sip&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n was exalted with a standard,
presented with a horse and a dress of honour, and despatched to the
Deccan. This day I made a remarkable shot with a gun. By chance there
was inside the palace a <i>khirn&#299;</i> tree (<i>Mimusops
Kauki</i>). A <i>qur&#299;s&#863;ha</i><a class="noteref" id=

in the midst of it. I fired at it and struck it in the middle of its
breast; from where I stood to the top of the branch was 22 gaz. On
Saturday, the 26th, marching about 2 kos, I pitched at the village of
Kam&#257;lp&#363;r. On this day I shot a blue bull.<a class="noteref"

K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of the principal attendants of my son
S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n, and who had been appointed from Burhanpur
with a body of the royal servants against the zamindars of
Gon&#7693;w&#257;na, having taken a tribute of 110 elephants and
120,000 rupees, came this day to wait upon me. Z&#257;hid, son of
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n, was given the mansab of 1,000
personal and 400 horse, original and increase. On Sunday, the 27th, I
hunted with hawks and falcons. On Monday I killed a large blue bull and
a bukra; the bull weighed 12&frac12; maunds. On Tuesday, the 29th, a
blue bull was killed. Bahl&#363;l Miy&#257;na and Allah-y&#257;r came
from service in Gon&#7693;w&#257;na, and had the good fortune to wait
upon me. Bahl&#363;l K&#863;h&#257;n is the son of H&#803;asan
Miy&#257;na, and Miy&#257;na is an Afghan tribe. In the commencement of
his career Hasan was a servant of &#7778;&#257;diq K&#863;h&#257;n, but
a servant who recognized the king (worthy of a king&rsquo;s service),
and was at last included among the royal servants and died on service
in the Deccan. After his death his sons were granted mansabs. He had
eight sons, and two of them became famous as swordsmen. The elder
brother in his youth gave up the deposit of his life. Bahl&#363;l by
degrees was promoted to the mansab of 1,000. At this time my son
S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n arrived at Burhanpur, and, finding him
worthy of patronage, made him hopeful with a mansab of 1,500 personal
and 1,000 horse. As he had not yet waited on me and was very desirous
to kiss the threshold, I summoned him to Court. He is in truth
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb406" href="#v1pb406" name=
"v1pb406">406</a>]</span>a good K&#863;h&#257;na-z&#257;da
(household-born one), inasmuch as his heart is adorned with the
perfection of bravery and his exterior is not wanting in good
appearance. The mansab my son S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n had bespoken
for him was granted at his request, and he was honoured with the title
of Sar-buland K&#863;h&#257;n. Allah-y&#257;r Koka was also a brave
youth and a servant worthy of patronage. Finding him fit and suitable
for service in my presence, I sent for him to Court. On
Kam-s&#863;hamba (Wednesday), the 1st of the month of &#256;z&#817;ar,
I went out to hunt and shot a blue bull. On this day the
Kashmir<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8378src" href="#xd24e8378" name=
"xd24e8378src">57</a> reports were laid before me. One was that in the
house of a certain silk-seller two girls were born with teeth, and with
their backs as far as the waist joined together, but the heads, arms,
and legs were separate; they lived a short time and died. On
Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba, the 2nd, on the bank of a tank where my
tents were, a feast of cups was held. Presenting Las&#863;hkar
K&#863;h&#257;n with a dress of honour and an elephant, I promoted him
to the duty of diwan of the Subah of the Deccan, and gave him the
mansab of 2,500 personal and 1,500 horse, original and increase. To
each of the Wakils of &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n two<a class=

star) muhrs, the weight of each of which was 500 ordinary muhrs, were
given. I gave a horse and robe of honour to Sar-buland K&#863;h&#257;n.
As fitting service and approved activity were manifest in
Allah-y&#257;r Koka, I honoured him with the title of Himmat
K&#863;h&#257;n and gave him a dress of honour. On Friday, the 3rd, I
marched 4&frac14; kos and halted the royal standards in the parganah of

time of the Sultans of Malwa it was for a long time the capital. At the
time when Sult&#804;&#257;n Muh&#803;ammad Tug&#863;hluq was proceeding
to the conquest of the Deccan, he built a fort of cut stone on the top
of a ridge. Outside it is very showy and handsome, but inside the fort
is devoid of buildings. I ordered them to measure its length, breadth,
and height. The length inside the fort was 12 <i>t&#804;an&#257;b</i>,
7 gaz; the breadth, 17 tanab, 13 gaz, and the breadth of the fort wall
19&frac12; gaz. Its height up to the battlements appeared to be
17&frac12; gaz. The length of the outer circuit (?) of the fort was 55
tanabs. &#703;Am&#299;d S&#863;h&#257;h G&#863;hor&#299;, who was
called Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n, and who in the time of
Sult&#804;&#257;n Muh&#803;ammad, son of Sult&#804;&#257;n
F&#299;r&#363;z, king of Delhi, had complete authority over the
province of Malwa, built the J&#257;mi&#703; mosque in the inhabitable
part outside the fort, and opposite the gate of the mosque fixed a
quadrangular iron column. When Sult&#804;&#257;n Bah&#257;dur of
Gujarat took the province of Malwa into his own possession, he wished
to transfer this column to Gujarat. The artificers did not take proper
precautions when they lowered it, and it fell and broke into two
pieces, one of them of 7&frac12; gaz and the other of 4&frac14; gaz.
The column was 1&frac14; gaz round. As it was lying there useless, I
ordered them to take the larger piece to Agra and put<a class="noteref"

the courtyard of the mausoleum of H.M. Akbar, and to burn a lamp on the
top of it at night. The aforesaid mosque has two gates. In front of the

<p class="par first">When Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n gave up the
deposit of his life there was no king with full dominion over
Hindustan, and it was a time of confusion. H&#363;s&#863;hang, son of
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n, who was just and possessed of courage,
seeing his opportunity, sat on the throne of sovereignty in Malwa.
After his death through destiny the rule was transferred<a class=

after him to N&#257;&#7779;iru-d-d&#299;n, son of
G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n, who gave his father poison and sat
on the throne of infamy. From him it passed to his son
Mah&#803;m&#363;d. Sult&#804;&#257;n Bah&#257;dur of Gujarat took from
Mah&#803;m&#363;d the province of Malwa. The succession of kings of
Malwa ended with the aforesaid Mah&#803;m&#363;d.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 6th, I went to hunt and shot a female
nilgaw. Presenting an elephant to M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;harafu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain K&#257;s&#863;hg&#863;har&#299;,
I dismissed him to duty in the Subah of Bangash. A present of a
jewelled dagger, a muhr of 100 tolas, and 20,000 darbs was made to
&#362;d&#257; R&#257;m. On Tuesday, the 7th, I shot an alligator in the
tank at Dh&#257;r. Though only the top of his snout was visible and the
rest of his body was hidden in the water, I fired <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb409" href="#v1pb409" name=
"v1pb409">409</a>]</span>at a guess and hit him in his lungs and killed
him with a single shot. An alligator is of the crocodile species and
exists in most of the rivers of Hindustan, and grows very large. This
one was not so very big. An alligator has been seen (by me) 8 gaz long
and 1 gaz in breadth. On Sunday, marching 4&frac12; kos, I halted at
Sa&#703;dalp&#363;r. In this village there is a stream over which
N&#257;&#7779;iru-d-d&#299;n K&#863;halj&#299; built a bridge and
erected buildings. It is a place like K&#257;liy&#257;da, and both are
his works. Although his building is not worthy of praise, yet as it has
been built in the river-bed and they have made rivulets and reservoirs,
it is somewhat remarkable. At night I ordered them to place lamps all
round the canals and streams. On Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba (Thursday),
the 9th, a feast of cups was held. On this day I made a present to my
son S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n of a ruby of one colour, weighing 9
tanks and 5 surkh, of the value of 125,000 rupees, with two pearls.
This is the ruby which had been given to my father at the time of my
birth by H&#803;az&#803;rat Maryam-mak&#257;n&#299;, mother of H.M.
Akbar, by way of present when my face was shown, and was for many years
in his <i>sarp&#299;ch</i> (turban ornament). After him I also happily
wore it in my sarpich. Apart from its value and delicacy, as it had
come down as of auspicious augury to the everlasting State, it was
bestowed on my son. Having raised Mub&#257;riz K&#863;h&#257;n to a
mansab of 1,500 personal and horse, I appointed him to the
faujd&#257;rship of the province of Mew&#257;t, distinguishing him with
the present of a dress of honour, a sword, and an elephant. A sword was
given to Himmat K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Rustam K&#863;h&#257;n. I gave
Kam&#257;l K&#863;h&#257;n, the huntsman, who is one of the old
servants and is always present with me on hunting expeditions, the
title of S&#863;hik&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n (hunting-K&#863;h&#257;n).
Appointing &#362;d&#257; R&#257;m to service in the Subah of the
Deccan, I conferred on him a dress of honour, an elephant, and Iraq
horses (lit. wind-footed ones), and sent with him for the <span class=

&#256;t&#257;l&#299;q, a special gilt dagger
(<i>zar-nis&#863;h&#257;n</i>). On Friday, the 10th, I halted. On
Saturday, the 11th, I marched 3&frac34; kos and halted at the village
of H&#803;alwat.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8462src" href="#xd24e8462"
name="xd24e8462src">66</a> On Sunday, the 12th, marching 5 kos, I
halted in the parganah<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8466src" href=

M&#257;r&#363;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8475src" href="#xd24e8475"

<i>wat&#804;an</i> (native country) to him. He had constructed gardens
and buildings. Out of these one was a well (<i>b&#257;ol&#299;</i>)
(step-well probably) on the road, which appeared exceedingly pleasant
and well made. It occurred to me that if a well had to be made anywhere
on a roadside it should be built like this one. At least two such ought
to be made.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 13th, I went to hunt and shot a blue
bull. From the day on which the elephant N&#363;r-bak&#863;ht was put
into the special elephant stables, there was an order that he should be
tied up in the public palace (court). Among animals elephants have the
greatest liking for water; they delight to go into the water,
notwithstanding the winter and the coldness of the air, and if there
should be no water into which they can go, they will take it from a
water-bag (<i>mas&#863;hk</i>) with their trunks and pour it over their
bodies. It occurred to me that however much an elephant delights in
water, and it is suited to their temperament, yet in the winter the
cold water must affect them. I accordingly ordered the water to be made
lukewarm (as warm as milk) before they (the elephants) poured it into
their trunks. On other days when they poured cold water over themselves
they evidently shivered, but with warm water, on the contrary they were
delighted. This usage is entirely my own. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par">On Tuesday, the 14th, marching 6 kos, I halted at
S&#299;lga&#7771;h (Sabalga&#7771;h ?). On Wednesday, the 15th,
crossing the Mah&#299; River, a halt was made near R&#257;mga&#7771;h.
A march of 6 kos was made on Thursday, the 16th, and a halt was made
and a feast of cups held at a waterfall near the camp. Distinguishing
Sar-buland K&#863;h&#257;n with a standard and giving him an elephant,
I dismissed him to do duty in the Deccan. His mansab, original and
increase, was fixed at 1,500 personal and 1,200 horse. R&#257;ja
Bh&#299;m Nar&#257;yan, Zamindar of Gadeha, who had been promoted to
the mansab of 1,000 horse, obtained leave to go to his jagir. Having
raised R&#257;ja Bharj&#299;v, Zamindar of Bagl&#257;&#7751;a, to the
mansab of 4,000, I gave him leave to go to his native country, and an
order was given that when he arrived there he should send to Court his
eldest son, who was his successor, that he might do duty in my
presence. I honoured H&#803;&#257;j&#299; Bal&#363;ch, who was the
chief of the huntsmen and was an active and old servant, with the title
of Bal&#363;ch K&#863;h&#257;n. On Friday, the 17th, marching 5 kos, I
alighted at the village of Dh&#257;vala. On Saturday, the 18th, which
was the feast of Qurb&#257;n, after the Qurb&#257;n rites had been
performed, marching 3&frac14; kos, I halted on the bank of the tank of

trees and stony land. On Tuesday, the 21st, I halted. On
Kam-s&#863;hamba (Wednesday), the 22nd, marching 5&frac14; kos, I
halted at the village of Rany&#257;d (Ren&#257;v ?). On Thursday, the

marching 2&frac12; kos, the royal standards were hoisted at the village
of J&#257;lot. At this halt some jugglers from the Carnatic came and
showed their tricks. One of them placed one end of an iron chain,

it up. On Saturday, the 25th, there was a halt. On Sunday, the 26th,
marching 5 kos, I alighted at the village of N&#299;mdah. On Monday,
the 27th, also marching 5 kos, I pitched on the bank of a tank. On
Tuesday, the 28th, marching 3&frac34; kos, the royal standards alighted

flower of the lotus, which in the Hindi language they call
<i>kumudin&#299;</i>, is of three colours&mdash;white, blue, and red. I

have seen in Kashmir many kanwal with a hundred leaves (petals). It is
certain that it opens during the day and becomes a bud at night. The
kumudini, on the contrary, is a bud during the day and opens at night.
The black bee, which the people of India call
<i>bhau&#7751;r&#257;</i>, always sits on these flowers, and goes
inside them to drink the juice that is in both of them. It often
happens that the kanwal flower closes and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

in it the whole night. In the same manner it remains in the kumudini
flower. When the flower opens it comes out and flies away. As the black
bee is a constant attendant on these flowers, the poets of India look
on it as a lover of the flower, like the nightingale, and have put into
verse sublime descriptions of it. Of these poets the chief was T&#257;n
Sen Kal&#257;want, who was without a rival in my father&rsquo;s service
(in fact, there has been no singer like him in any time or age). In one
of his compositions he has likened the face of a young man to the sun
and the opening of his eyes to the expanding of the kanwal and the exit
of the bee. In another place he has compared the side-glance of the
beloved one to the motion of the kanwal when the bee alights on it.</p>

Kam-s&#863;hamba, the 29th, and Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba, the 30th, we
halted. At this stage Sar-far&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n came from
Ahmadabad and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Out of his
offerings a rosary of pearls, bought for 11,000 rupees, two elephants,
two horses, two bullocks and a riding cart, and some pieces of
Gujarat&#299; cloth, were accepted, and the remainder presented to him.
Sar-far&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n is a grandson of Mus&#257;h&#803;ib Beg,
by which name he was called by Akbar after his grandfather, who was one
of the Amirs of Hum&#257;y&#363;n. In the beginning of my reign I
increased his mansab and appointed him to the Subah of Gujarat. As he
had an hereditary connection with the Court as a Khana-zada (one born
in the house), he proved himself efficient in the Subah of Gujarat.
Considering him worthy of patronage, I gave him the title of
Sar-far&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n and raised him in the world, and his
mansab has risen to 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. On Friday,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb414" href="#v1pb414" name=

halted on the bank of the tank of Jhasod.<a class="noteref" id=

the flesh of fish, especially that of the rohu, which is the best kind
of fish in Hindustan, and I had never, notwithstanding much enquiry,
had one for eleven months from the time of crossing the pass of

M&#257;n. Although the parganah of Dohad is reckoned as within the
boundary of Gujarat, yet, in fact, it was from this stage that all
things appeared different. The open plains and soil are of a different
kind; the people are different and the language of another description.
The jungle that appeared on the road, has fruit-bearing trees, such as
the mango and <i>khirn&#299;</i> and tamarind, and the method of
guarding the cultivated fields is with hedges of <i>zaqq&#363;m</i>.
The cultivators separate their fields with cactus, and leave a narrow
road between them for coming and going. Since all this country has a
sandy soil, when any movement takes place, so much dust rises that the
faces of people are seen with difficulty, so that one should call
Ahmadabad &lsquo;Gard&#257;b&#257;d&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=

dust). On Saturday, the 2nd, having marched 3&frac34; kos, I encamped
on the bank of the Mah&#299;. On Sunday, the 3rd, again after a march
of 3&frac34; kos, I halted at the village of Bardala. At this stage a
number of mansabdars who had been appointed to serve in Gujarat had the
good fortune to kiss the threshold. Marching 5 kos on Monday, the 4th,
the royal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb415" href="#v1pb415" name=

Mond&#257;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8574src" href="#xd24e8574" name=

equal to 23,000 current tumans of Iraq. The population of the town
(<i>qa&#7779;ba</i>), too, is dense. Whilst I passed through it I
scattered 1,000 rupees. All my mind is bent upon this, that under any
pretext the people of God may be benefited. As the chief way of riding
among the people of this country is in carts, I also wished to travel
in a cart. I sat for 2 kos in a cart, but was much troubled with the
dust, and after this till the end of the stage rode on horseback. On
the road Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n came from Ahmadabad, and had the good
fortune to wait on me, and presented an offering of a pearl he had
bought for 30,000 rupees. On Friday, the 8th, marching 6&frac12; kos,
the place of the descent of prosperity was on the shore of the salt

<p class="par">Cambay<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8589src" href=
"#xd24e8589" name="xd24e8589src">82</a> is one of the old ports.
According to the brahmins, several thousand years have passed since its
foundation. In the beginning its name was Trimb&#257;wat&#299;, and
R&#257;ja Tryambak Kunwar had the government of the country. It would
take too long to write in detail the circumstances of the aforesaid
Raja as the brahmins relate it. In brief, when the turn to the
government came round <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb416" href=
"#v1pb416" name="v1pb416">416</a>]</span>to R&#257;ja Abhay
Kum&#257;r,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8594src" href="#xd24e8594" name=
"xd24e8594src">83</a> who was one of his grandsons, by the decree of
heaven a great calamity happened to this city. So much dust and earth
were poured on it that all the houses and buildings were hidden, and
the means of livelihood of many people was destroyed. Before the
arrival of this calamity, an idol (<i>but</i>), which the Raja
worshipped, came in a dream and announced this event. The Raja with his
family embarked in a ship, and carried away the idol with them with a
pillar it had behind it for a support. By chance the ship also was
wrecked by a storm of misfortune. As there was left still a term of
life for the Raja, that pillar bore the boat of his existence in safety
to the shore, and he proposed to rebuild the city. He put up the pillar
as a mark of repopulation and the coming together of the people. As in
the Hindi language they call a pillar <i>istambh</i> and <i>khambh</i>,
they called the city Istambhnagar&#299; and Khamb&#257;wat&#299;, and
sometimes also Trimb&#257;wat&#299;, in connection with the
Raja&rsquo;s name; Khamb&#257;wat&#299; has by degrees and much use
become Khamb&#257;yat (Cambay). This port is one of the largest
ports<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8607src" href="#xd24e8607" name=
"xd24e8607src">84</a> in Hindustan and is near a firth, which is one of
the firths of the Sea of Oman. It has been estimated to be 7 kos in
width, and nearly 40 kos in length. Ships cannot come inside the firth,
but must cast anchor in the port of Gog&#257;, which is a
dependency<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8610src" href="#xd24e8610" name=
"xd24e8610src">85</a> of Cambay and situated near the sea. Thence,
putting their cargoes into <i>ghur&#257;bs</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8615src" href="#xd24e8615" name="xd24e8615src">86</a> (commonly
called &lsquo;grabs&rsquo;) they bring them to the port of Cambay. In
the same way, at the time of loading a ship they carry the cargo in
ghurabs and put it in the ships. Before the arrival of the victorious
host some ghurabs from European ports had come to Cambay to buy and
sell, and were about to return. On Sunday, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb417" href="#v1pb417" name=
"v1pb417">417</a>]</span>the 10th, they decorated them and showed them
to me. Taking leave they went about their business. On Monday, the
11th, I myself went on board a ghurab for about a kos on the face of
the water. On Tuesday, the 12th, I went out with cheetahs
(<i>y&#363;z</i>), and captured two<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8627src"
href="#xd24e8627" name="xd24e8627src">87</a> antelope. On Wednesday,
the 13th, I went to see the tank of T&#257;rangsar
(Narangsar?),<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8630src" href="#xd24e8630"
name="xd24e8630src">88</a> and passed through the streets and bazaar on
the way, scattering nearly 5,000 rupees. In the time of H.M. Akbar (may
Allah&rsquo;s lights be his testimony), Kaly&#257;n R&#257;y, the
superintendent of the port, by His Majesty&rsquo;s order built a wall
of brick and cement round the city, and many merchants came from
various quarters and settled there, and built fine houses and employed
themselves in gaining their livelihood under easy circumstances.
Although its market is small, it is clean and full of people. In the
time of the Sultans of Gujarat the customs of this port came to a large
sum. Now in my reign it is ordered that they should not take more than
one in forty. In other ports, calling it a tithe, they take one in ten
or one in eight, and give all kinds of trouble to merchants and
travellers. In Jeddah, which is the port of Mecca, they take one in
four or even more. One may imagine from this what the customs of the
ports of Gujarat must have come to in the time of the former rulers.
God be praised that this suppliant at the throne of God obtained the
grace to remit the whole of the customs dues of his dominions, which
came to a countless sum, and the very name of customs
(<i>tamg&#863;h&#257;</i>) has passed away from my empire. At this time
an order was given that tankas<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8644src"
href="#xd24e8644" name="xd24e8644src">89</a> of gold and silver should
be coined twice the weight of ordinary muhrs and rupees. The legend
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb418" href="#v1pb418" name=

&ldquo;Jah&#257;ng&#299;r-s&#863;h&#257;h&#299;, 1027&rdquo; (1618),
and on the reverse &ldquo;Struck in Cambay in the 12th year of the
reign.&rdquo; The legend for silver coins was on one side &ldquo;Sikka,
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r-s&#863;h&#257;h&#299;, 1027&rdquo;; round it this
hemistich, &ldquo;King Jah&#257;ng&#299;r of the conquering ray struck

year of the reign,&rdquo; with this second hemistich round
it&mdash;</p>

of Am&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n, the superintendent
(<i>muta&#7779;add&#299;</i>) of Cambay, was laid before me in the
women&rsquo;s apartments. His mansab was fixed, original and increase,
at 1,500 personal and 400 horse. N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299; was
honoured with the mansab, original and increase, of 3,000 personal and
600 horse. On Friday, the 15th, mounted on the elephant
N&#363;r-bak&#863;ht, I made it run after a horse. It ran exceedingly
well, and when it was stopped stood well. This is the third time that I
myself have ridden it. On Saturday, the 16th, R&#257;m D&#257;s, son of
Jay Singh<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8673src" href="#xd24e8673" name=
"xd24e8673src">91</a>, was promoted to the mansab, original and

days during which I was encamped on the shore of the salt sea,
merchants, traders, indigent people, and other inhabitants of the port
of Cambay having been summoned before me, I gave each according to his
condition a dress of honour or a horse or travelling money or
assistance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb419" href="#v1pb419" name=

&#7778;&#257;h&#803;ib Sajj&#257;da (Lord of the prayer carpet) of
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam (a mosque near Ahmadabad), the sons of
S&#863;haik&#863;h Muh&#803;ammad G&#863;haus&#804;, S&#863;haik&#863;h
H&#803;aidar, grandson of Miy&#257;n Waj&#299;h&#363;-d-d&#299;n, and
other Shaikhs living at Ahmadabad came to meet me and pay their
respects. As my desire was to see the sea and the flow and ebb of the
water, I halted for ten days, and on Tuesday, the 19th (Day, about 30th
December, 1618), the royal standards started for Ahmadabad. The best
description of fish procurable in this place, the name of which is
<i>&#703;arb&#299;yat</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8688src" href=
"#xd24e8688" name="xd24e8688src">92</a> was caught and frequently
brought for me by the fishermen. Without doubt these fish, are, as
compared with other fish of this country, more delicious and better,
but they are not of the flavour of the roh&#363;. One might say as nine
to ten or even eight to ten. Of the food which is peculiar to the
people of Gujarat there is the <i>khich&#7771;&#299;</i> of
<i>b&#257;jr&#257;</i> (a mixture of split peas and millet boiled
together); this they also call <i>laz&#817;&#299;z&#817;a</i>. It is a
kind of split grain, which does not grow in any other country but
Hindustan, and which in comparison with many other regions of India is
more abundant in Gujarat; it is cheaper than most vegetables. As I had
never eaten it, I ordered them to make some and bring it to me. It is
not devoid of good flavour, and it suited me well. I ordered that on
the days of abstinence, when I partake of dishes not made with flesh,
they should frequently bring me this khichri On the said Tuesday having
marched 6&frac14; kos, I halted at the village of Kos&#257;l&#257;. On
Wednesday, the 20th, I passed through the parganah of
B&#257;br&#257;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8703src" href="#xd24e8703"
name="xd24e8703src">93</a> and halted on the bank of the river. This
was a march of 6 kos. On Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba, the 21st, I halted
and held a feast of cups. In this river I caught many fish, and divided
them among the servants who were present at the feast. On Friday, the
22nd, having moved on 4 kos, I pitched at <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb420" href="#v1pb420" name="v1pb420">420</a>]</span>the village of
B&#257;&#7771;&#299;ch&#257;. On this road, walls came in sight from
2&frac12; to 3 <i>gaz</i> in length, and on enquiry it appeared that
people had made them from the desire of spiritual reward. When a porter
is tired on the road he places his burden on the wall and gains his
breath a little, and lifting it up again with ease and without
assistance from anyone proceeds towards his destination. This is one of
the peculiar ideas of the people of Gujarat. The building of these
walls pleased me greatly, and I ordered that in all large
towns<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8712src" href="#xd24e8712" name=
"xd24e8712src">94</a> they should make walls of this kind at the
imperial expense. On Saturday, the 23rd marching 4&frac34; kos, the
camp was pitched at the K&#257;nkr&#299;ya tank. Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n
Muh&#803;ammad, grandson of Sult&#804;&#257;n Ah&#803;mad, the founder
of the city of Ahmadabad, made this tank, and placed round it steps of
stone and cement. In the middle of the tank he constructed a little
garden and some buildings. Between the bank of the tank and these
buildings he had made a causeway, which was the way for entering and
leaving, Since this occurred a long time ago, most of the buildings had
become dilapidated, and there was no place left fit to sit in. At the
time when the host of prosperity was about to proceed towards
Ahmadabad, &#7778;af&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, bakhsh&#299; of Gujarat,
repaired at the expense of government what was broken down and in
ruins, and clearing out the little garden erected a new building in it.
Certainly it is a place exceedingly enjoyable and pleasant. Its style
pleased me. On the side where the causeway is,
Niz&#804;&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n Ah&#803;mad,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8715src" href="#xd24e8715" name="xd24e8715src">95</a> who was for
a while bakhshi of Gujarat in my father&rsquo;s time, had made a garden
on the bank of the tank. At this time a representation was made to me
that &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, in consequence of a dispute that
he had with &#703;&#256;bid, son of Niz&#804;&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n
Ah&#803;mad, cut down the trees of this garden. I also heard that
during his government <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb421" href=
"#v1pb421" name="v1pb421">421</a>]</span>he, at a wine party, signed to
a slave, and cut off the head of an unfortunate man who was not wanting
in fun and jesting, merely because in a state of drunkenness he had
uttered some improper expressions by way of a joke. On hearing these
two reports, my sense of justice was shocked, and I ordered the Diwans
to change one thousand of his two-horsed and three-horsed cavalry into
one-horsed, and to deduct from his jagir the difference (of pay), which
came to 7,000,000 dams<span class="corr" id="xd24e8720" title=

<p class="par">As at this stage the tomb of S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;&#256;lam was by the roadside, I recited the
<i>f&#257;tih&#803;a</i> in passing by it. About 100,000 rupees had
been spent in building this mausoleum. S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam
was the son of Qut&#804;b &#703;&#256;lam, and their family goes back
to Mak&#863;hd&#363;m-i-Jah&#257;niy&#257;n<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8728src" href="#xd24e8728" name="xd24e8728src">96</a> (a saint).
The people of this country, high and low, have a wonderful belief in
him, and they say that S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam used to raise
the dead. After he had raised several dead men, his father became aware
of this and sent him a prohibition, saying it was presumption in him to
meddle with the workshop of God, and was contrary to true obedience. It
happened that S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam had an attendant (female)
who had no children, but at S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam&rsquo;s
prayer God Almighty bestowed a son on her. When he reached his
27th<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8734src" href="#xd24e8734" name=
"xd24e8734src">97</a> year he died, and that slave came weeping and
wailing into his presence, saying, &ldquo;My son has died, and he was
my only son; since God Almighty gave him to me by your favour, I am
hopeful that through your prayer he may become alive.&rdquo;
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam fell into thought for a time and went
into his cell, and the attendant went to his son, who greatly loved
her, and besought him to ask the S&#863;h&#257;h to make his son alive.
The son, who was of tender years, went into his cell, and used much
entreaty. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb422" href="#v1pb422" name=
"v1pb422">422</a>]</span>S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam said,
&ldquo;If you are content to give up your life for him, perhaps my
petition may be accepted.&rdquo; He represented &ldquo;I am perfectly
contented with what may be your wish and the desire of God.&rdquo;
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam took his son&rsquo;s hands, and lifting
him up from the ground turned his face towards heaven and said,
&ldquo;O God, take this kid in place of that one.&rdquo;
Instantaneously the boy surrendered his soul to God, and
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam laid him down on his own bed and
covered his face with a sheet, and coming out of the house said to that
attendant, &ldquo;Go home, and get news of thy son; perhaps he may have
been in a trance and not have died.&rdquo; When she arrived at her
house she saw her son alive. In short, in the country of Gujarat they
say many things of this sort of S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam. I
myself asked Sayyid Muh&#803;ammad, who is lord of his prayer carpet
(in charge of the mausoleum), and who is not wanting in excellence and
reasonableness, what was the real state of the case. He said, &ldquo;I
have also heard the same from my father and grandfather, and it has
come down in succession, and wisdom is from Allah.&rdquo; Although this
affair is beyond the laws of understanding, yet, as it has attained
great notoriety among men, it has been recorded as a strange
occurrence. His departure from this perishable mansion to the eternal
world took place in 880 (1475), in the time of the reign of
Sult&#804;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d B&#299;gara, and the buildings of
this mausoleum are the memorial of T&#257;j K&#863;h&#257;n
Tariy&#257;n&#299;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8739src" href=
"#xd24e8739" name="xd24e8739src">98</a> who was one of the Amirs of
Sult&#804;&#257;n Muzaffar, the son of Mah&#803;m&#363;d.</p>
<p class="par">As an hour on Monday had been chosen for my entry into
the city, on Sunday, the 24th, I halted. At this place some melons came
from K&#257;riz, which is a town dependent on Herat, and it is certain
that in Khurasan there are no melons better than those of K&#257;riz.
Although <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb423" href="#v1pb423" name=
"v1pb423">423</a>]</span>this is at a distance of 1,400 kos, and
kafilahs (caravans) take five months to come, they arrived very ripe
and fresh. They brought so many that they sufficed for all the
servants. Together with these there came oranges
(<i>kau&#7751;l&#257;</i>) from Bengal, and though that place is 1,000
kos distant most of them arrived quite fresh. As this is a very
delicate and pleasant fruit, runners bring by post as much as is
necessary for private consumption, and pass it from hand to hand. My
tongue fails me in giving thanks to Allah for this.</p>

is perfect in appearance and disposition. Although he was fractious
(<i>mast</i>), I had confidence in my own riding and his pleasant paces
(<i>?</i>).<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8763src" href="#xd24e8763" name=
"xd24e8763src">99</a> Crowds of people, men and women, had assembled,
and were waiting in the streets and bazars and at the gates and the
walls. The city of Ahmadabad did not seem to me so worthy of praise as
I had heard. Although they had made the main road of the bazar wide and
spacious, they had not suited the shops to this breadth. Its buildings
are all of wood and the pillars of the shops slender and mean
(<i>zab&#363;n</i>). The streets of the bazar were full of dust, and
there was dust from the K&#257;nkriy&#257; tank up to the citadel,
which in the dialect of the country they call Bhadar. I hastened along
scattering <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb424" href="#v1pb424" name=
"v1pb424">424</a>]</span>money. The meaning of Bhadar is
&lsquo;blessed&rsquo; (<i>bhadra</i>). The houses of the Sultans of
Gujarat, which were inside the Bhadar, have fallen into ruin within the
last fifty or sixty years, and no trace of them is left. However, our
servants who have been sent to the government of this country have
erected buildings. When I was proceeding from M&#257;nd&#363; to
Ahmadabad, Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n had done up the old buildings and
prepared other places for sitting that were necessary, such as a
jharokha, a public audience hall, etc. As to-day was the auspicious day
for the weighing of my son S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n, I weighed him in
the usual manner against gold and other things, and the 27th year from
his blessed birth began in pleasure and enjoyment. I hope that the
Giver of gifts will bestow him on this suppliant at His throne and let
him enjoy life and prosperity. On the same day I gave the province of
Gujarat in jagir to that son. From the fort of M&#257;nd&#363; to the
fort of Cambay, by the road we came, it is 124 kos, which were
traversed in twenty-eight marches and thirty halts. I remained at
Cambay for ten days; from that place to the city of Ahmadabad is 21
kos; which we traversed in five marches with two halts. Altogether,
from M&#257;nd&#363; to Cambay and from Cambay to Ahmadabad by the road
we came is 145 kos, which we accomplished in two months and fifteen
days; this was in thirty-three marches and forty-two halts.</p>
<p class="par">On Tuesday, the 26th, I went to see the J&#257;mi&#703;
mosque, and gave with my own hand in alms to the fakirs who were
present there about 500 rupees. This mosque was one of the memorials of
Sult&#804;&#257;n Ah&#803;mad, the founder of the city of Ahmadabad. It
has three gates,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8782src" href="#xd24e8782"
name="xd24e8782src">100</a> and on each side a bazar. Opposite the gate
that looks towards the east is the mausoleum of the said
Sult&#804;&#257;n Ah&#803;mad. In that dome Sult&#804;&#257;n
Ah&#803;mad, his son Muh&#803;ammad, and his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb425" href="#v1pb425" name=
"v1pb425">425</a>]</span>grandson Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n are laid to
rest. The length of the court of the mosque, excluding
<i>maq&#7779;&#363;ra</i> (the holy of holies), is 103<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8790src" href="#xd24e8790" name=
"xd24e8790src">101</a> cubits, and its breadth 89 cubits. Round this
they have made an <i>ayw&#257;n</i> (portico), in breadth 4&frac34;
cubits. The flooring of the court is of trimmed bricks, and the pillars
of the portico of red stone. The maqsura contains 354<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e8797src" href="#xd24e8797" name="xd24e8797src">102</a>
pillars, above which there is a dome. The length of the maqsura is 75
cubits, and its breadth 37 cubits. The flooring of the maqsura, the
<i>mihr&#257;b</i> (arch towards which the face is turned in prayer),
and the pulpit are made of marble. On both sides of the main arch
(<i>p&#299;sh-t&#804;&#257;q</i>) are two polished minarets of cut
stone, containing three <i>&#257;shy&#257;na</i> (stories) beautifully
shaped and decorated. On the right-hand side of the pulpit near the
recess of the maqsura they have made a separate seat for the king. The
space between the pillars has been covered in with a stone platform,
and round this up to the roof of the maqsura they have put stone
cages<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8809src" href="#xd24e8809" name=
"xd24e8809src">103</a> (in which women sit so as not to be seen). The
object of this was that when the king came to the Friday service or the
&#703;&#298;d he went up there with his intimates and courtiers, and
performed his devotions. This in the dialect of the country they call
the Mul&#363;k-k&#863;h&#257;na (King&rsquo;s chamber). This practice
and caution were on account of the crowding of the people. Truly this
mosque is a very noble building.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8814src"

<p class="par">On Wednesday,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8819src" href=
"#xd24e8819" name="xd24e8819src">105</a> the 27th, I went to the
monastery of S&#863;haik&#863;h Waj&#299;hu-d-d&#299;n, which was near
the palace, and the <i>f&#257;tih&#803;a</i> was read at the head of
his shrine, which is in the court of the monastery. &#7778;&#257;diq
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of the chief Amirs of my father, built
this monastery. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb426" href="#v1pb426"
name="v1pb426">426</a>]</span>The Shaikh was a successor of
S&#863;haik&#863;h Muh&#803;ammad G&#863;haus&#804;,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e8827src" href="#xd24e8827" name="xd24e8827src">106</a> but a
successor against whom the teacher disputed.
Waj&#299;hu-d-d&#299;n&rsquo;s loyalty to him is a clear proof<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8830src" href="#xd24e8830" name=
"xd24e8830src">107</a> of the greatness of S&#863;haik&#863;h
Muh&#803;ammad G&#863;haus&#804;. S&#863;haik&#863;h
Waj&#299;hu-d-d&#299;n was adorned with visible excellencies and
spiritual perfection. He died thirty years ago in this city
(Ahmadabad), and after him S&#863;haik&#863;h &#703;Abdu-llah,
according to his father&rsquo;s will, took his place. He was a very
ascetic dervish. When he died his son S&#863;haik&#863;h Asadu-llah sat
in his place, and also quickly went to the eternal world. After him his
brother S&#863;haik&#863;h H&#803;aidar became lord of the prayer
carpet, and is now alive, and is employed at the grave of his father
and grandfather in the service of dervishes and in looking after their
welfare. The traces of piety are evident on the forehead of his life.
As it was the anniversary festival of S&#863;haik&#863;h
Waj&#299;hu-d-d&#299;n, 1,500 rupees were given to S&#863;haik&#863;h
H&#803;aidar for the expenses of the anniversary, and I bestowed 1,500
rupees more on the band of fakirs who were present in the monastery,
with my own hand in charity, and made a present of 500 rupees to the
grandson (?) of S&#863;haik&#863;h Waj&#299;hu-d-d&#299;n. In the same
way I gave something for expenses, and land to each of his relatives
and adherents according to his merit. I ordered S&#863;haik&#863;h
H&#803;aidar to bring before me the body of dervishes and deserving
people who were associated with him, in order that they might ask for
money for expenses and for land. On Thursday, the 28th, I went to look
round the Rustam-K&#863;h&#257;n-b&#257;&#7771;&#299;, and scattered
1,500 rupees on the road. They call a garden a
<i>b&#257;&#7771;&#299;</i> in the language of India. This is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb427" href="#v1pb427" name=
"v1pb427">427</a>]</span>a garden that my brother S&#863;h&#257;h
Mur&#257;d made in the name of his son Rustam. I made a Thursday
entertainment in this garden, and gave cups to some of my private
servants. At the end of the day I went to the little garden of the
<i>h&#803;aw&#257;l&#299;</i> (mansion) of S&#863;haik&#863;h Sikandar,
which is situated in the neighbourhood of this garden, and which has
exceedingly good figs. As picking the fruit with one&rsquo;s own hand
gives it quite a different relish, and I had never before plucked figs
with my own hand, their excellence in this respect was approved.
S&#863;haik&#863;h Sikandar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8845src" href=
"#xd24e8845" name="xd24e8845src">108</a> is by origin a Gujarati, and
is not wanting in reasonableness, and has complete information about
the Sultans of Gujarat. It is now eight or nine years since he has been
employed among the servants (of the State). As my son S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n had appointed to the government of Ahmadabad Rustam
K&#863;h&#257;n, who is one of his chief officers, at his request I, in
accordance with the association of his name, presented him with (the
garden) Rustam-b&#257;&#7771;&#299;. On this day R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n,
zamindar of the province of &#298;&#7693;ar, had the good fortune to
kiss my threshold, and presented an elephant and nine horses as an
offering; I gave him back the elephant. He is one of the most
considerable zamindars on the frontier of Gujarat, and his country is
close to the hill-country of the R&#257;n&#257;. The Sultans of Gujarat
constantly sent armies against the Raja of that place. Although some of
them have professed obedience and presented offerings, for the most
part none of them have come to see anyone personally. After the late
king Akbar conquered Gujarat, the victorious army was sent to attack
him. As he understood that his deliverance lay in obedience and
submission, he agreed to serve and be loyal, and hastened to enjoy the
good fortune of kissing the threshold. From that date he has been
enrolled among the servants (of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb428" href="#v1pb428" name="v1pb428">428</a>]</span>State). He
comes to see whoever is appointed to the government of Ahmadabad, and
when work and service are necessary appears with a body of his men. On
Saturday, the 1st of the month of Bahman, in the 12th year of my reign,
Chandar Sen, who is one of the chief zamindars of this country, had the
good fortune to kiss the threshold, and presented an offering of nine
horses. On Sunday, the 2nd, I gave elephants to R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n,
zamindar of &#298;&#7693;ar, to Sayyid Mu&#7779;t&#804;af&#257;, and
M&#299;r F&#257;z&#803;il. On Monday I went out hawking, and scattered
nearly 500 rupees on the road. On this day pears came from Badakhshan.
On Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba, the 6th, I went to see the &ldquo;garden
of victory&rdquo; at the village of Sair-khaiz (Sarkhej), and scattered
1,500 rupees on the way. As the tomb of S&#863;haik&#863;h Ah&#803;mad
K&#863;ha&#7789;&#7789;&#363;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8850src" href=
"#xd24e8850" name="xd24e8850src">109</a> is on the road, I first went
there and the <i>f&#257;tih&#803;a</i> was read.
K&#863;ha&#7789;&#7789;&#363; is the name of a town in the Sarkar of
N&#257;gor, and was the birthplace of the Shaikh.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8857src" href="#xd24e8857" name="xd24e8857src">110</a> The Shaikh
lived in the time of Sult&#804;&#257;n Ah&#803;mad, who founded the
city of Ahmadabad, and the latter had a great respect for him. The
people of this country have a strange belief in him, and consider him
one of the great saints. Every Friday night a great crowd of people,
high and low, go to visit his shrine. Sult&#804;&#257;n Muh&#803;ammad,
son of the aforesaid Sult&#804;&#257;n Ah&#803;mad, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb429" href="#v1pb429" name=
"v1pb429">429</a>]</span>built lofty buildings in the shape of
mausoleums, mosques, and monasteries at the head of his tomb, and near
his mausoleum on the south side made a large tank, and surrounded it
with stone and lime (masonry). This building was completed in the time
of Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n, son of the aforesaid Muh&#803;ammad. The
shrines of several of the Sultans of Gujarat are on the bank of the
tank by the feet of the Shaikh. In that dome there have been laid at
rest Sult&#804;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d B&#299;gara, Sult&#804;&#257;n
Muz&#804;affar, his son, and Mah&#803;m&#363;d, the martyr, grandson of
Sult&#804;&#257;n Muz&#804;affar, and who was the last of the Sultans
of Gujarat. B&#299;gara, in the language of the people of Gujarat,
signifies &lsquo;turned-up moustache,&rsquo; and Sult&#804;&#257;n
Mah&#803;m&#363;d had a large turned-up moustache; on this account they
call him B&#299;gara. Near his (S&#863;haik&#863;h
K&#863;ha&#7789;&#7789;&#363;&rsquo;s) tomb is the dome of his
ladies.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8868src" href="#xd24e8868" name=
"xd24e8868src">111</a> Without doubt the mausoleum of the Shaikh is a
very grand building and a beautiful place. It is estimated that 500,000
rupees were spent on it. God only knows what is true.</p>
<p class="par">After performing this visitation I went to
Fath&#803;-b&#257;g&#863;h (garden of victory). This garden is situated
on the ground on which the Commander-in-Chief,
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n &#256;t&#257;l&#299;q fought with
and defeated Nab&#363; (Nann&#363;? Nanh&#363;?), who gave himself the
title of Muz&#804;affar K&#863;h&#257;n. On this account he called it
B&#257;g&#863;h-i-fath&#803;; the people of Gujarat call it
Fath&#803;-b&#257;&#7771;&#299;. The details of this are that when, by
means of the good fortune of the late king Akbar, the country of
Gujarat was conquered, and Nab&#363; fell into his hands,
I&#703;tim&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n represented that he was the son of a
carter. As no son was left by Sult&#804;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d, and
moreover there was no one of the descendants of the Sultans of Gujarat
whom he could raise to the throne, he (I&#703;tim&#257;d) had accepted
the most available course, and had made out that this was the son of
Mah&#803;m&#363;d. He gave him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb430"
href="#v1pb430" name="v1pb430">430</a>]</span>the name of
Sult&#804;&#257;n Muz&#804;affar, and raised him to the sovereignty.
Men from necessity consented to this. As His Majesty considered the
word of I&#703;tim&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n of weight, he ignored
Nab&#363;, and for some time he did duty among the servants, and the
king paid no attention to his case. In consequence of this he ran away
from Fath&#803;p&#363;r, and coming to Gujarat lived for some years
under the protection of the zamindars. When
S&#863;hih&#257;bu-d-d&#299;n Ah&#803;mad K&#863;h&#257;n was turned
out from the government of Gujarat and I&#703;tim&#257;d
K&#863;h&#257;n installed in his place, a body of the servants of
S&#863;hih&#257;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n, who were attached to
Gujarat, separated from him, and remained at Ahmadabad in the hope of
service with I&#703;tim&#257;d. After I&#703;tim&#257;d entered the
city they had recourse to him, but had no good luck with him. They had
not the face to go to S&#863;hih&#257;bu-d-d&#299;n, and had no
prospects in Ahmadabad. As they were without hope they thought their
remedy lay in betaking themselves to Nab&#363;, and in making him an
excuse for disturbance. With this intent 600 or 700 horsemen from among
them went to Nab&#363; and carried him off along with Lon&#257;
K&#257;th&#299;, under whose protection he was living, and proceeded to
Ahmadabad. When he arrived near the city many wretched men on the look
out for an occasion joined him, and nearly 1,000 horsemen, Mughals and
Gujaratis, collected together. When I&#703;tim&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n
became aware of this he left his son S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n in
the city, and hastened off in search of S&#863;hih&#257;b
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was proceeding towards the Court, in order that
with his help he might quiet the disturbance. Many of the men had
separated themselves from him, and he read on the faces of those who
were left the signs of unfaithfulness, but
S&#863;hih&#257;bu-d-d&#299;n, in company with I&#703;tim&#257;d
K&#863;h&#257;n, turned his rein. It happened that before their arrival
Nab&#363; had entered the fort of Ahmadabad. Those who were loyal drew
up their troops near the city, and the rebels came out of the fort and
hastened to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb431" href="#v1pb431"
name="v1pb431">431</a>]</span>battlefield. When the army of the rebels
showed itself, those of the servants of S&#863;hih&#257;b
K&#863;h&#257;n who were left took the wrong road and joined the enemy.
S&#863;hih&#257;b K&#863;h&#257;n was defeated and hastened towards
Pa&#7789;an (P&#257;tan?), which was in the possession of the royal
servants. His retinue and camp were plundered, and Nab&#363;, bestowing
mansabs and titles on the rebels, went against Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n
Muh&#803;ammad K&#863;h&#257;n, who was in Baroda. The servants of the
latter, like the servants of S&#863;hih&#257;b K&#863;h&#257;n, took
the road of faithlessness and chose separation, as is related in detail
in the Akbar-n&#257;ma. In the end, after giving his word to
Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n Muh&#803;ammad, he sent him to martyrdom, and
his goods and property, which were equal to the treasure of his
courtesy and grandeur, were plundered. Nearly 45,000 horsemen collected
round Nab&#363;.</p>
<p class="par">When this state of affairs was represented to H.M. Akbar
he sent against him M&#299;rz&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Bair&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, with a force of brave warriors. On the day when
M&#299;rz&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n arrived near the city, he drew up the
ranks of good fortune. He had about 8,000 or 9,000 horse, and Nab&#363;
met him with 30,000, and drew up his host tainted with ruin. After
prolonged fighting and slaughter the breeze of victory blew on the flag
of the loyal, and Nab&#363;, being defeated, fled in wretched plight.
My father, in reward for this victory, gave M&#299;rz&#257;
K&#863;h&#257;n a mansab of 5,000 with the title of
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n and the government of the country
of Gujarat. The garden that K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n made
on the field of battle is situated on the bank of the River
S&#257;barmat&#299;. He founded lofty buildings along that eminence on
the river, and made a strong wall of stone and cement round the garden.
The garden contains 120 <i>jar&#299;b</i> of land, and is a charming
resort. It may have cost 200,000 rupees. It pleased me greatly. One may
say that in the whole of Gujarat there is no garden like this.
Arranging a Thursday feast, I bestowed cups on my private servants, and
remained there for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb432" href=
"#v1pb432" name="v1pb432">432</a>]</span>night. At the end of the day,
on Friday, I entered the city, scattering about 1,000 rupees on the
road. At this time the gardener represented that a servant of Muqarrab
K&#863;h&#257;n had cut down some <i>champ&#257;</i> trees above the
bench alongside the river. On hearing this I became angry, and went
myself to enquire into the matter and to exact satisfaction. When it
was established that this improper act had been committed by him, I
ordered both his thumbs to be cut off as a warning to others. It was
evident that Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n knew nothing of this affair, or
otherwise he would have punished him there and then. On Tuesday, the
11th, the Kotwal of the city caught a thief and brought him. He had
committed several thefts before, and each time they had cut off one of
his members; once his right hand, the second time the thumb of his left
hand, the third time his left ear, and fourth time they hamstringed
him, and the last time his nose; with all this he did not give up his
business, and yesterday entered the house of a grass-seller in order to
steal. By chance the owner of the house was on the look out and seized
him. The thief wounded the grass-seller several times with a knife and
killed him. In the uproar and confusion his relatives attacked the
thief and caught him. I ordered them to hand over the thief to the
relatives of the deceased, that they might retaliate on him.</p>

<p class="par first">On Wednesday, the 12th, 3,000 rupees were handed
over to &#703;Az&#804;amat K&#863;h&#257;n and Mu&#703;taqad
K&#863;h&#257;n, that they might go the next day to the tomb of
S&#863;haik&#863;h Ah&#803;mad K&#863;ha&#7789;&#7789;&#363;, and
divide it among the fakirs and indigent people who had taken up their
abode there. On Thursday, the 13th, I went to the lodging of my son
S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n, and held a Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba
entertainment there, and distributed cups among my private servants. I
gave my son the elephant Sundar Mathan,<a class="noteref" id=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb433" href="#v1pb433" name=
"v1pb433">433</a>]</span>superior to all my private elephants in speed
and beauty and pleasant paces, and competed with horses, and was the
first among the elephants, and one much liked by King Akbar. My son
S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n had a great liking for him, and frequently
asked him of me, and seeing no way out of it I gave it to him with its
gold belongings of chains, etc., together with a female elephant. A
present of 100,000 of darbs was given to the wakils of &#703;&#256;dil
K&#863;h&#257;n. At this time it was represented<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8907src" href="#xd24e8907" name="xd24e8907src">113</a> to me that
Mukarram K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Mu&#703;az&#804;z&#804;am
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was the governor of Orissa, had conquered the
country of K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;, and that the Raja of that place had
fled and gone into the R&#257;jmahendra. As he was a
<i>k&#863;h&#257;na-z&#257;d</i> (houseborn one) and worthy of
patronage, I ordered his mansab, original and increase, to be 3,000
personal and 2,000 horse, and honoured him with drums, a horse, and a
dress of honour. Between the province of Orissa and Golconda there were
two zamindars, one the Raja of K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257; and the second
the Raja of R&#257;jmahendra. The province of K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;
has come into the possession of the servants of the Court. After this
it is the turn of the country of R&#257;jmahendra. My hope in the grace
of Allah is that the feet of my energy may advance farther. At this
time a petition from Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk reached my son S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n to the effect that as the boundary of his territory had
approached that of the King, and he owed service to this Court, he
hoped an order would be issued to Mukarram K&#863;h&#257;n not to
stretch out his hand, and to acquire possession of his country. It was
a proof of Mukarram&rsquo;s valour and energy that such a one as
Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk should be apprehensive about his (Mukarram) becoming
his neighbour.</p>
<p class="par">On this day Ikr&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n, son of
Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n, was appointed faujd&#257;r of
Fath&#803;p&#363;r and its neighbourhood, and presented with a dress of
honour and an elephant; Chandar <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb434"

Haloz&#817; (Halwad?),<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8917src" href=
"#xd24e8917" name="xd24e8917src">114</a> was given a dress of honour, a
horse, and an elephant. An elephant was also given to L&#257;ch&#299;n
Q&#257;qs&#863;h&#257;l. At the same time Muz&#804;affar,<a class=

"xd24e8920src">115</a> son of M&#299;rz&#257; B&#257;q&#299;
Tark&#863;h&#257;n, had the honour of kissing the threshold. His mother
was the daughter of B&#257;rha (Bh&#257;r&#257;), the zamindar of
Kachh. When M&#299;rz&#257; B&#257;q&#299; died and the government of
Thatta went to M&#299;rz&#257; J&#257;n&#299;, Muz&#804;affar was
apprehensive of M&#299;rz&#257; J&#257;n&#299;, and he took refuge with
the aforesaid zamindar. He had remained from his childhood until now in
that country. Now that the fortunate retinue had reached Ahmadabad, he
came and did homage. Though he had been reared among men of the wilds,
and was unfamiliar with civilized ways and ceremonies, yet as his
family had had the relations of service with our exalted dynasty from
the times of Timur<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8923src" href=
"#xd24e8923" name="xd24e8923src">116</a>&mdash;may God make his proof
clear!&mdash;I considered it right to patronize him. For the present I
gave him 2,000 rupees for expenses, and a dress of honour. A suitable
rank will be given to him, and perhaps he will show himself efficient
as a soldier.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 20th, I went to the &ldquo;Garden of
Victory,&rdquo; and contemplated the red roses. One plot had bloomed
well. There are not many red roses (<i>gul-i-surk&#863;h</i>) in this
country, so it was pleasant to see so many here. The anemone<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8937src" href="#xd24e8937" name=
"xd24e8937src">117</a> bed, too, was not bad, and the figs had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb435" href="#v1pb435" name=
"v1pb435">435</a>]</span>ripened. I gathered some figs with my own
hands, and weighed the largest one. It came to 7&frac12; tolas. On this
day there arrived 1,500 melons from K&#257;r&#299;z. The
K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam had sent them as a present. I gave a
thousand of them to the servants in attendance, and five hundred to the
women of the harem. I spent four days in this garden in enjoyment, and
on Monday eve, the 24th, I came to the city. Some of the melons were
given to the Shaikhs of Ahmadabad, and they were astonished to see how
inferior were the Gujarat melons. They marvelled at the goodness of the
Deity.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 27th, I held a wine-feast in the
Nag&#299;na<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8946src" href="#xd24e8946" name=
"xd24e8946src">118</a> garden, which is inside the palace grounds, and
which one of the Gujarat Sultans had planted. I made my servants happy
with flowing bowls. A pergola (<i>tak&#863;hta</i>) of grapes had
ripened in this garden, and I bade those who had been drinking to
gather the bunches with their own hands and partake of them.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 1st of Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;, I left
Ahmadabad and marched towards Malwa. I scattered money on the road till
we reached the bank of the K&#257;nkriy&#257; tank, where I halted for
three days. On Thursday, the 4th, the presents of Muqarrab
K&#863;h&#257;n were laid before me. There was nothing rare among them,
nor anything that I took a fancy to, and so I felt ashamed. I gave them
to my children to take into the harem. I accepted jewellery and
decorated vessels and cloths to the value of a lakh, and gave him back
the rest. Also about one hundred Kachhi horses were taken, but there
was none of great excellence.</p>
<p class="par">On Friday, the 5th, I marched 6 kos, and encamped on the
bank of the Ahmadabad River. As my son S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n was
leaving Rustam K&#863;h&#257;n, one of his chief servants, in charge of
the government of Gujarat, I, at my son&rsquo;s request, gave him a
standard, drums, a dress <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb436" href=
"#v1pb436" name="v1pb436">436</a>]</span>of honour, and a decorated
dagger. Up till now it had not been the custom in this dynasty to give
to the prince&rsquo;s servants standards or drums. For instance, H.M.
Akbar with all his affection and graciousness to me, did not decide
upon giving to my officers a title or a standard. But my consideration
for this son is so unbounded that I would do anything to please him,
and, in fact, he is an excellent son, and one adorned with every grace,
and in his early youth has accomplished to my satisfaction, everything
that he has set his hand to.</p>
<p class="par">On this day Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n took leave to go to
his home.</p>
<p class="par">As the shrine of Qut&#804;b &#703;&#256;lam, the father
of S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#299;, was in the
village of Batoh,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8965src" href="#xd24e8965"
name="xd24e8965src">119</a> and on my way, I went there and gave 500
rupees to the guardians. On Saturday, the 6th, I entered a boat on the
Mahm&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d River and went a-fishing. On the bank is the
tomb of Sayyid Mub&#257;rak Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#299;. He was one of the
leading officers of Gujarat, and his son Sayyid M&#299;r&#257;n erected
this monument to him. It is a very lofty cupola, and there is a very
strong wall of stone and lime round it. It must have cost more than two
lakhs of rupees. None of the tombs of the Gujarat Sultans that I saw
came up to one-tenth of it. Yet they were sovereigns, and Sayyid
M&#299;r&#257;n was only a servant. Genius and the help of God have
produced this result. A thousand blessings on a son who has made such a
tomb for his father:<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8968src" href=

<p class="par first">On Sunday I halted and fished, and caught 400
fish. One of them had no scales, and is called the
<i>sang-m&#257;h&#299;</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb437"
href="#v1pb437" name="v1pb437">437</a>]</span>&lsquo;the
stone-fish.&rsquo; Its belly was very large and swollen, so I ordered
them to cut it open in my presence. Inside was a fish with scales which
it had recently swallowed and which had as yet undergone no change. I
told them to weigh both fish. The stone-fish came to 6&frac12; seers
and the other to nearly 2.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 8th, I marched 4&frac14; kos, and
encamped in the village of Moda (Mah&#257;ondat). The inhabitants
praised the rainy season of Gujarat. It happened that on the previous
night and on this day before breakfast some rain fell, and the dust was
laid. As this is a sandy country, it is certain that there would not be
any dust in the rainy season, nor would there be any mud. The fields
would be green and cheerful. At any rate, a specimen of the rainy
season has been seen by me. On Tuesday I marched 5&frac12; kos, and
halted at the village of Jars&#299;ma (Jar&#299;sam&#257;).<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8983src" href="#xd24e8983" name=
"xd24e8983src">121</a></p>
<p class="par">At this stage news came that M&#257;n Singh
Sew&#7771;&#257; had surrendered his soul to the lords of hell. The
account of this in brief is that the Sewras<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8989src" href="#xd24e8989" name="xd24e8989src">122</a> are a
tribe of infidel Hindus who always go with their head and feet bare.
One set of them root out their hair, their beards, and moustaches,
while another set shave them. They do not wear sewn garments, and their
central principle is that no living creature should be injured. The
Banyans regard them as their <i>p&#299;rs</i> and teachers, and even
worship them. There are two sects of Sewras, one called Pat&#257;
(Tap&#257;) and the other Kanthal (Kartal). M&#257;n Singh was the head
of the latter, and B&#257;l Chand the head of the Pat&#257;s.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8995src" href="#xd24e8995" name=
"xd24e8995src">123</a> Both of them used to attend upon H.M. Akbar.
When he died and K&#863;husrau fled and I pursued him, R&#257;y Singh
Bhur&#7789;iy&#257;, zamindar of Bikanir, who had been made an
Am&#299;r by Akbar&rsquo;s kindness, asked M&#257;n Singh what
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb438" href="#v1pb438" name=
"v1pb438">438</a>]</span>would be the duration of my reign and the
chances of my success. That black-tongued fellow, who pretended to be
skilled in astrology and the extraction of judgments, said to him that
my reign would, at most, last for two years. The doting old idiot
(R&#257;y Singh) relied upon this, and went off without leave to his
home. Afterwards, when the glorious God chose out this suppliant and I
returned victorious to the capital, he came, ashamed and downcast, to
Court. What happened to him in the end has been told in its proper
place.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9000src" href="#xd24e9000" name=
"xd24e9000src">124</a> In fine, M&#257;n Singh, in the course of three
or four months, was struck with leprosy (<i>juz&#817;&#257;m</i>), and
his limbs fell off him till he was in such a state that death was by
many degrees preferable to life. He was living at Bikanir, and now I
remembered him and sent for him. On the road he, out of excessive fear,
took poison, and surrendered his soul to the lords of hell. So long as
the intentions of this suppliant at God&rsquo;s courts are just and
right, it is sure that whoever devises evil against me will receive
retribution according to his merits.</p>
<p class="par">The sect of the Sewras exists in most of the cities of
India, but is especially numerous in Gujarat. As the Banyans are the
chief traders there, consequently the Sewras also are plentiful.
Besides making idol-temples for them, they have built houses for them
to dwell in and to worship in. In fact, these houses are the
headquarters of sedition. The Banyans send their wives and daughters to
the Sewras, who have no shame or modesty. All kinds of strife and
audacity are perpetrated by them. I therefore ordered that the Sewras
should be expelled, and I circulated farmans to the effect that
wherever there were Sewras in my empire they should be turned out.

<p class="par">On Wednesday, the 10th, I went out to hunt, and shot two
nilgaw, one male and one female. On this day the son of Dil&#257;war
K&#863;h&#257;n came from Pattan, which was his father&rsquo;s fief,
and paid his respects. He presented a Kachh&#299; horse. It was a very
handsome animal, and pleasant to ride. Till I came to Gujarat no one
had presented me with so fine a horse. Its value was 1,000 rupees.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 11th, I had a wine party on the bank of
the tank, and bestowed many favours on those servants who had been
appointed to the province, and then dismissed them. Among the
promotions was that of S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n, the
Arab, to the rank of 2,500 personal and 2,000 horse. I also gave him
drums, a horse, and a robe of honour. Himmat K&#863;h&#257;n was raised
to the rank of 1,500 with 800 horse, and had a robe of honour and an
elephant. Kif&#257;yat K&#863;h&#257;n, who was made Diwan of the
province, received the rank of 1,200 with 300 horse. &#7778;af&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n bakhshi received a horse and a robe of honour.
K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;&#256;qil had the rank of 1,500 with 650 horse,
and was made bakhshi of the Ahadis, and had the title of
&#703;&#256;qil K&#863;h&#257;n. Thirty thousand darbs were given to
the wakil of Qut&#804;bu-l-Mulk, who had brought the tribute.</p>
<p class="par">On this day my son S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n presented
pomegranates and quinces that had been sent to him from Far&#257;h. I
had never seen such large ones, and I ordered them to be weighed. The
quince weighed 29 tolas 9 mashas and the pomegranate 40&frac12; tolas.
On Friday, the 12th, I went a-hunting and shot two nilgaw, a male and a
female. On Saturday, the 13th, I shot three nilgaw, two males and one
female. On Sunday, the 14th, I gave S&#863;haik&#863;h
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l, the son of S&#863;haik&#863;h Muh&#803;ammad
G&#863;haus&#804;, a robe of honour and 500 rupees. On Monday, the
15th, I went a-hunting and shot two female nilgaw. On Tuesday, the
16th, I again presented the Shaikhs of Gujarat, who were in attendance,
with robes of honour and maintenance-lands. To each of them I gave a
book from my special <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb440" href=
"#v1pb440" name="v1pb440">440</a>]</span>library, such as the
Tafs&#299;r-i-kas&#863;hs&#863;h&#257;f,<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">At the time that Ahmadabad was adorned by the setting up
of the royal standards my employment by day and by night was the seeing
of necessitous persons and the bestowing on them of money and land. I
directed S&#863;haik&#863;h Ah&#803;mad the &#7778;adr and some other
tactful servants to bring before me dervishes and other needy persons.
I also directed the sons of S&#863;haik&#863;h Muhammad
G&#863;haus&#804;, the grandson of S&#863;haik&#863;h
Waj&#299;hu-d-d&#299;n, and other leading Shaikhs to produce whatever
persons they believed to be in want. Similarly I appointed some women
to do the same thing in the harem. My sole endeavour was that as I a
king had come to this country after many years, no single person should
be excluded. God is my witness that I did not fall short in this task,
and that I never took any rest from this duty. Although I have not been
delighted with my visit to Ahmadabad, yet I have this
satisfaction&mdash;that my coming has been the cause of benefit to a
large number of poor people.</p>
<p class="par">On Tuesday, the 16th, they caught Kaukab, the son of
Qamar K&#863;h&#257;n. He had in Burhanpur put on a faqir&rsquo;s dress
and gone off into the wilds. The brief account of his case is
this:&mdash;He was the grandson of M&#299;r
&#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f, who was one of the Saif&#299; Sayyids
and was attached to this Court. Kaukab had been appointed to the Deccan
army, and had spent some days with it in poverty and wretchedness. When
for a long time he did not get promotion he suspected that I was
unfavourable to him, and foolishly took the dress of asceticism and
went off to the wilderness. In the course of six months he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb441" href="#v1pb441" name=
"v1pb441">441</a>]</span>traversed the whole of the Deccan, including
Daulatabad, Bidar, Bijapur, the Carnatic, and Golconda, and came to the
port of D&#257;bul.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9039src" href=
"#xd24e9039" name="xd24e9039src">128</a> From there he came by ship to
the port of Gog&#257;, and after visiting the ports of Surat,
Bro&#257;ch, etc., he reached Ahmadabad. At this time Z&#257;hid, a
servant of S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n, arrested him and brought him to
Court. I ordered them to bring him before me heavily bound. When I saw
him I said to him, &ldquo;Considering the obligations of service of
your father and grandfather, and your position as a houseborn one, why
have you behaved in such an inauspicious manner?&rdquo; He replied that
he could not tell a lie in the presence of his <i>qibla</i> and real
teacher, and that the truth was that he had hoped for favours, but as
he was unlucky he had left outward ties and gone into the wilderness of
exile. As his words bore the marks of truth they made an impression on
me, and I abandoned my harsh tone and asked him if in his misfortunes
he had waited upon &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, or
Qut&#804;bu-l-Mulk, or &#703;Ambar. He replied that though he had been
unsuccessful at this Court and had remained thirsty in this boundless
ocean of beneficence, he had never&mdash;God forbid that he
should&mdash;approached with his lips other fountains. Might his head
be cut off if it had bowed at this Court and then lowered itself at
another! From the time that he went into exile he had kept a diary
showing what he had done, and by examining it it would be seen how he
had conducted himself. These words of his increased my compassion for
him, and I sent for his papers and read them. It appeared from them
that he had encountered great hardship, and that he had spent much time
on foot, and that he had suffered from want of food. On this account I
felt kindly disposed towards him. Next day I sent for him and ordered
them to remove the bonds from his arms and legs, and gave him a robe of
honour, a horse, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb442" href="#v1pb442"
name="v1pb442">442</a>]</span>and 1,000 rupees for his expenses. I also
increased his rank by one half, and showed him such kindness as he
never had imagined. He repeated this verse&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;What I see, is it, O God, waking or in a
trance?</p>

<p class="par first">On Wednesday, the 17th, I marched 6 kos and halted
at the village of B&#257;ras&#299;nor (B&#257;las&#299;nor). It has
already been mentioned that the plague had appeared in Kashmir. On this
day a report of the chronicler of events arrived, stating that the
plague had taken firm hold of the country and that many had died. The
symptoms were that the first day there was headache and fever and much
bleeding at the nose. On the second day the patient died. In the house
where one person died all the inmates were carried off. Whoever went
near the sick person or a dead body was affected in the same way. In
one instance the dead body was thrown on the grass, and it chanced that
a cow came and ate some of the grass. It died, and some dogs that had
eaten its flesh also all died. Things had come to such a pass that from
fear of death fathers would not approach their children, and children
would not go near their fathers. A strange thing was that in the ward
in which the disease began, a fire broke out and nearly 3,000 houses
were burnt. During the height of the plague, one morning when the
people of the city and environs got up, they saw circles on their
doors. There were three large circles, and on the face of these (i.e.
inside them) there were two circles of middle size and one small one.
There were also other circles which did not contain any
whiteness<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9054src" href="#xd24e9054" name=
"xd24e9054src">129</a> (i.e. there were no inner circles). These
figures were found on all the houses and even on the mosques. From the
day when the fire took place and these circles appeared, they say there
was a diminution of the plague. This has been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb443" href="#v1pb443" name=
"v1pb443">443</a>]</span>recorded as it seems a strange affair. It
certainly does not agree with the canons of reason, and my intellect
cannot accept it. Wisdom is with God! I trust that the Almighty will
have mercy on his sinful slaves, and that they will be altogether freed
from such calamity.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 18th, I marched 2&frac12; kos and
halted on the bank of the Mah&#299;. On this day the J&#257;m
zamindar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9063src" href="#xd24e9063" name=
"xd24e9063src">130</a> had the good fortune to kiss the ground. He
presented 50 horses, 100 muhrs, and 100 rupees. His name is Jass&#257;,
and J&#257;m is his title. Whoever succeeds is called J&#257;m. He is
one of the chief zamindars of Gujarat, and, indeed, he is one of the
noted rajas of India. His country is close to the sea. He always
maintains 5,000 or 6,000 horse, and in time of war can supply as many
as 10,000 or 12,000. There are many horses in his country; Kachh&#299;
horses fetch as much as 2,000 rupees. I gave him a dress of honour.</p>
<p class="par">On the same day Lachm&#299; Nar&#257;yan, Raja of
K&#363;ch (Bih&#257;r), which adjoins Bengal, did homage and presented
500 muhrs. He received a dress of honour and an ornamented dagger.</p>
<p class="par">Naw&#257;zish K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Sa&#703;&#299;d
K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been appointed to J&#363;naga&#7771;h, had the
good fortune to pay his respects. On Friday, the 19th, I halted, and on
Saturday, the 20th, I marched 3&frac34; kos and halted at the tank of
Jhan&#363;d. On Sunday I marched 4&frac12; kos and halted at the tank
of Badarw&#257;l&#257;. On this day there came the news of the death of
&#703;Az&#804;amat K&#863;h&#257;n Gujar&#257;t&#299;. On account of
illness he had remained in Ahmadabad. He was a servant who knew
one&rsquo;s disposition, and did good work. As he had thorough
knowledge of the Deccan and Gujarat, I was grieved at his death. In the
tank above mentioned I noticed a plant which at the approach of the
finger or the end of a stick contracts its leaves. After a while it
opens them out again. Its leaves resemble those of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb444" href="#v1pb444" name=
"v1pb444">444</a>]</span>the tamarind, and it is called in Arabic
<i>S&#863;hajaru-l-h&#803;ay&#257;</i>, &lsquo;the plant of
modesty.&rsquo; In Hind&#299; it is called <i>Lajvant&#299;</i>.
<i>L&#257;j</i> means modesty. It is certainly not void of strangeness.

there was a tiger in the neighbourhood which vexed wayfarers, and in
the forest where it was they had seen a skull and some bones lying.
After midday I went out to shoot it, and killed it with one discharge.
Though it was a large tiger, I had killed several that were larger.
Among them was a tiger which I killed in the fort of M&#257;nd&#363;,
and which was 8&frac12; maunds. This one weighed 7&frac12; maunds, or 1

<p class="par">Pahluw&#257;n Bah&#257;&#702;u-d-d&#299;n, the
musketeer, brought a young monkey (<i>lang&#363;r</i>) with a goat, and
represented that on the road one of his marksmen had seen the female
langur with a young one in its arms on a tree. The cruel man had shot
the mother, which on being struck had left the young one on a branch,
and had herself dropped on the ground and died. Pahluw&#257;n
Bah&#257;&#702;u-d-d&#299;n had then come up and taken down the young
one, and had put it beside the goat to be suckled. God had inspired the
goat with affection for it, and it began to lick the monkey and to
fondle it. In spite of difference of species she showed such love as if
it had come out of her own womb. I told them to separate them, but the
goat immediately began to lament, and the young langur also became much
distressed. The affection of the monkey is not so remarkable, as it
wanted to get milk, but the affection of the goat for it is remarkable.
The langur is an animal belonging to the monkey tribe. But the hair of
the monkey (<i>maim&#363;n</i>) is yellowish and its face is red, while
the hair of the langur is white and its face is black. Its tail, too,
is twice as long as the maimun&rsquo;s. I have written these things on
account of their strangeness. On Monday, the 29th, I halted and went to
hunt nilgaw. I shot two, one male and one female. On Tuesday also, the
30th, I halted.</p>

who had the title of Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n, was born at Delhi of a
noble family in 737 <span class="sc">A.H.</span> (1336&ndash;7). He was
the disciple and successor of B&#257;b&#257; Ish&#803;&#257;q (Isaac)

after a while entered the service of B&#257;b&#257; Ish&#803;&#257;q.
Mag&#863;hrib&#299;. He acquired from him spiritual and secular
learning, and came to Gujarat in the time of Sult&#804;&#257;n
Ah&#803;mad. High and low accepted him, and paid him homage. Afterwards
he travelled to Arabia and Persia, and made the acquaintance of many
saints. He is buried at Sarkhech, near

<p class="par first">On the eve of Wednesday, the 23rd
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal, 1027 (March 10, 1618), after the lapse of
fourteen and a half <i>ghar&#299;s</i>, the entrance of the
Sun&mdash;that is, H.M. the Great Light&mdash;the Benefactor of the
Universe, into the constellation of the Ram, took place. Twelve years
had now passed from the august Accession of this suppliant at the
throne of God, in prosperity, and the New Year began in joy and
thanksgiving. On Thursday, 2 Farward&#299;n, Divine month, the festival
of my Lunar weighment took place, and the fifty-first<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e9135src" href="#xd24e9135" name="xd24e9135src">1</a> year of
the age of this suppliant at God&rsquo;s throne began with rejoicings.
I trust that my life will be spent in the doing of God&rsquo;s Will,
and that not a breath of it will pass without remembering Him. After
the weighment had been finished, a fresh feast of joy was arranged, and
my domestic servants celebrated the day with brimming cups.</p>
<p class="par">On this day &#256;&#7779;af K.
(N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s brother), who held the rank of 5,000 with
3,000 horse, was favoured by the grant of 4,000 two-horsed and
three-horsed troopers, and S&#804;&#257;bit K. was raised to the office
of Examiner of Petitions. I bestowed the post of the Artillery on
Mu&#703;tamid K. A Kachh (Cutch) horse had been brought as an offering
by the son of Dil&#257;war K. No horse so good as this had come into my
establishment till I encamped in Gujarat, and as M. Rustam showed a
great liking for it, I presented it to him. On the J&#257;m were
conferred four rings&mdash;viz., diamond, ruby, emerald, and
sapphire<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb2" href="#v2pb2" name=
"v2pb2">2</a>]</span>&mdash;and two hawks. I also gave four
rings&mdash;viz., ruby, cat&rsquo;s-eye, emerald, and sapphire&mdash;to
Raja Lachm&#299; Nar&#257;yan (of K&#363;ch Bih&#257;r). Muruwwat K.
had sent three elephants from Bengal, and two of them were included in
my private stud. On the eve of Friday I ordered lamps to be placed
round the tank, and this had a very good appearance. On Sunday
H&#803;&#257;j&#299; Raf&#299;q came from &#703;Ir&#257;q, and had the
good fortune to kiss the threshold, and laid before me a letter which
my brother S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s had sent with him. The
aforesaid person is a slave of M&#299;r Muh&#803;ammad Am&#299;n K.,
the caravan leader, and the M&#299;r had brought him up from his
childhood. In truth, he is an excellent servant. He frequently visited
&#703;Ir&#257;q, and became intimate with my brother S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;Abb&#257;s. This time he had brought tipch&#257;q<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e9145src" href="#xd24e9145" name="xd24e9145src">2</a>
horses and fine cloth-stuffs, such that of the horses some were put
into the private stables. As he is a skilful slave, and a servant
worthy of favour, I honoured him with the title of
<i>Maliku-t-tujj&#257;r</i> (King of Merchants). On Monday I gave Raja
Lachm&#299; Nar&#257;yan a special sword, a jewelled rosary, and four
pearls for ear-rings. On <i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i> (Thursday) I
increased by 500 horse the man&#7779;ab of 5,000 personal and 1,000
horse held by M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam; I&#703;tiq&#257;d K. was promoted
to a man&#7779;ab of 4,000 and 1,000 horse; Sarfar&#257;z K. was
promoted to a man&#7779;ab of 2,500 and 1,400 horse; Mu&#703;tamid K.
to the rank of 1,000 with 350 horse. On
A&#7751;&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299; Singh-dalan and Fid&#257;&#702;&#299;
K., horses worth 100 <i>muhars</i> were conferred. As the guarding and
administration of the Punjab had been entrusted to
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula, I, at his request, promoted to the
government (h&#803;uk&#363;mat) of the said &#7778;ubah, M&#299;r
Q&#257;sim, the Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; of the Ah&#803;ad&#299;s, who
is related to him, and bestowed on him a man&#7779;ab of 1,000 personal
with 400 horse and the title of Q&#257;sim K. Before this I had given
Raja Lachm&#299; Nar&#257;yan an &#703;Ir&#257;q horse. On this day I
conferred on him an elephant and a Turk&#299; horse, and gave him leave
to go to Bengal. The J&#257;m was dismissed to his native country with
a present of a jewelled waist-sword, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb3" href="#v2pb3" name="v2pb3">3</a>]</span>a jewelled rosary, two
horses, one from &#703;Ir&#257;q and the other a Turk&#299;, and a
dress of honour. &#7778;&#257;lih&#803;, brother&rsquo;s son of the
deceased &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id=

to a man&#7779;ab of 1,000 with 300 horse, and allowed to go to Bengal,
and a horse was conferred on him. On this date M&#299;r Jumla<a class=

S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abbas, and has the rank of &#7778;adr, and the
Shah has married him to his own daughter. M&#299;r Jumla had left
Persia fourteen years before this, and gone to Golconda to
Muh&#803;ammad Qul&#299; Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk. His name is Muh&#803;ammad
Am&#299;n. Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk gave him the title of M&#299;r Jumla. For
ten years he had been his <i>Mud&#257;r &#703;Alaihi</i> (Centre of
Affairs) and his <i>&#7778;&#257;h&#803;ib S&#257;m&#257;n</i>
(factotum). After Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk died, and the rule came to his
brother&rsquo;s son, the latter did not treat the M&#299;r properly,
and so he took leave and hastened to his native country. The Shah, on
account of his connection with M&#299;r Riz&#803;&#257;, and the
respect which he had for men<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9175src" href=
"#xd24e9175" name="xd24e9175src">5</a> of merit, showed much
consideration for and kindness to him. He (the M&#299;r) also presented
fitting offerings, and passed three or four years in Persia, and
amassed properties (estates?).<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9179src"
href="#xd24e9179" name="xd24e9179src">6</a> As he several times
represented that he wished to enter the service of this Court, I sent a
farm&#257;n and invited him. Immediately the farm&#257;n arrived he
severed his connections there, and set the face of loyalty towards this
Court. This day he attained the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb4"
href="#v2pb4" name="v2pb4">4</a>]</span>honour of kissing the carpet,
and produced as offering twelve horses, nine <i>tuq&#363;z</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e9186src" href="#xd24e9186" name="xd24e9186src">7</a>
of silk cloths, and two rings. As he had come with devotion and
sincerity, I conferred favours and kindness on him, and presented him
with 20,000 <i>darbs</i> (Rs. 10,000) for his expenses and a dress of
honour. On the same day I gave the post of Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; of
the Ah&#803;ad&#299;s to &#703;In&#257;yat K. in place of Q&#257;sim K.
I honoured K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;&#256;qil, who is one of the old
servants, with the title of &#703;&#256;qil K., and presented him with
a horse. On Friday, Dil&#257;war K., coming from the Deccan, had the
good fortune to kiss the threshold, and presented an offering of 100
<i>muhars</i> and Rs. 1,000. B&#257;qir K., Faujd&#257;r of Multan, was
promoted to a man&#7779;ab of 800 personal and 300 horse. Tij&#257;rat
K. and B&#257;h&#363;&#702;&#299;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9196src"
href="#xd24e9196" name="xd24e9196src">8</a> Zamindar of Multan, were
honoured with the gift of elephants. On Saturday, the 11th, marching
from Doh&#803;ad with the intention of hunting elephants, I pitched at
the village of Kara B&#257;ra (Garbara ?). On Sunday, the 12th, the
village of Saj&#257;ra (Sajwara ?) became the place of alighting. It is
8 <i>koss</i> from this place to Doh&#803;ad, and 1&frac12; <i>koss</i>
to the hunting-ground. On the morning of Monday, the 13th, I went to
hunt elephants with a body of my private servants. As the grazing-place
of the elephants is in a hilly country, with elevations and
depressions, a passage is obtained with difficulty by one on foot.
Before this, a large body of horse and foot had surrounded the jungle
after the manner of a <i>qamurg&#863;ha</i>, and outside the jungle, on
a tree, they had prepared a wooden platform for me. On all sides of
this they had arranged seats on other trees for the Amirs. They had got
ready 200 male elephants with strong nooses, and many female elephants.
On each elephant there were seated two elephant-drivers of the tribe of
<i>Jarga</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9211src" href="#xd24e9211"
name="xd24e9211src">9</a> whose special employment <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb5" href="#v2pb5" name="v2pb5">5</a>]</span>is the
hunting of elephants, and it had been arranged that they should bring
the wild elephants from the jungle into my presence, that I might
witness the hunt. It happened that at the time when the men from all
sides entered the jungle, in consequence of the thickness of the forest
and the heights and hollows, the chain was broken, and the order of the
<i>qamurg&#863;ha</i> did not remain perfect. The wild elephants in
bewilderment turned in every direction, but twelve male and female came
to this side (where J. was). As the fear was that they might escape,
they drove in the tame elephants and tied them (the wild elephants) up
wherever they found them. Although many elephants were not caught, at
least two excellent ones were captured, very handsome in shape, of good
breed, and perfect marks. As there is a hill in the jungle in which the
elephants were, called R&#257;kas (R&#257;kshas) Pah&#257;r,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e9220src" href="#xd24e9220" name=
"xd24e9220src">10</a> or demon hill, I called these two elephants
R&#257;van Sar and P&#257;van Sar, these being the names of two demons.
On Tuesday, the 14th, and Kam-s&#863;hamba (Wednesday), the 15th, I
halted.</p>
<p class="par">On the eve of Thursday, the 16th, I marched, and halted
at the stage of Kara B&#257;ra. H&#803;&#257;kim Beg,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e9225src" href="#xd24e9225" name="xd24e9225src">11</a> who is
one of the household of the Court, was honoured with the title of
H&#803;&#257;kim K., and a sum of Rs. 3,000 was given to Sangr&#257;m,
a Zamindar of the hill country of the Panjab. As the heat was very
great, and marching by day was to be avoided, I marched by night. On
Saturday, the 18th, a halt was made in the parganah of Dohad. On
Sunday, the 19th, the sun that bestows favour on the world attained the
highest point in the constellation of Aries. On this day a great
entertainment was held, and I sat on the throne. I promoted
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K., who held a man&#7779;ab of 5,000, with
the favour of 2,000 horse, of two and three horses. K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan, the Chief Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;, was given a
mansab, original and increased, of 4,000 with 2,000 horse. As Ahmad Beg
K., of Kabul, who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb6" href="#v2pb6"
name="v2pb6">6</a>]</span>had obtained the governorship of Kashmir, had
promised that he would conquer in the space of two years Tibet and
Kis&#863;htw&#257;r, and the promised time had elapsed, and he had not
fulfilled this service, I removed him, and promoted Dil&#257;war K.
K&#257;kar to the Government of Kashmir. I gave him a dress of honour
and an elephant, and sent him off. He also made a promise in writing
that in the course of two years he would conquer Tibet and
Kis&#863;htw&#257;r. Bad&#299;&#702;u-z-Zam&#257;n, s.
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h M. came from the jagir he held in
Sul&#7789;&#257;np&#363;r, and had the good fortune to kiss the
threshold. Having at this time honoured Q&#257;sim K. with a jewelled
dagger and an elephant, I dismissed him to the Government of the
Punjab.</p>
<p class="par">On the night of Tuesday, the 21st, I marched from the
stage mentioned, and turned the reins of the army of prosperity towards
Ah&#803;mad&#257;b&#257;d. As in consequence of the great heat and the
corruption of the air I would have had to undergo much hardship, and
would have had to traverse a long distance before reaching Agra, it
occurred to me not to proceed at this hot season to the capital. As I
heard much praise of the rainy season in Gujarat, and there was no
report about the evil reputation of Ah&#803;mad&#257;b&#257;d (see
<i>infra</i> for account of epidemic there), I finally conceived the
idea of remaining there. Inasmuch as the protection and guardianship of
God (to Him be praise) was in all places and at all times extended to
this suppliant, just at this crisis news arrived that signs of the
plague (<i>wab&#257;</i>) had shown themselves again at Agra, and many
people were dying, my intention of not going to Agra, which had thrown
its rays on my mind through Divine inspiration, was confirmed. The
entertainment of Thursday, the 23rd, was held at the station of
Jalod.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9238src" href="#xd24e9238" name=
"xd24e9238src">12</a></p>
<p class="par">Previously to this, the rule of coinage was that on one
face of the metal they stamped my name, and on the reverse the name of
the place, and the month and year of the reign. At this time it entered
my mind that in place of the month they should substitute the figure of
the constellation which belonged to that month; for instance, in the
month of Farward&#299;n <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb7" href=
"#v2pb7" name="v2pb7">7</a>]</span>the figure of a ram, and in
Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht the figure of a bull. Similarly, in each month
that a coin was struck, the figure of the constellation was to be on
one face, as if the sun were emerging from it. This usage is my own,
and has never been practised until now.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e9245src" href="#xd24e9245" name="xd24e9245src">13</a></p>
<p class="par">On this day I&#703;tiq&#257;d K. was promoted to the
dignity of a standard, and a standard was also conferred on Muruwwat
K., who was attached to Bengal. On the night of Monday,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e9250src" href="#xd24e9250" name=
"xd24e9250src">14</a> the 27th, the camp was pitched in the village of
Badrw&#257;la, in the parganah of Sahra.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e9253src" href="#xd24e9253" name="xd24e9253src">15</a> At this
stage was heard the voice of the koel (<i>koyal</i>). The koel is a
bird of the crow tribe, but smaller. The crow&rsquo;s eyes are black,
and those of the koel red. The female has white spots, but the male is
all black. The male has a very pleasant voice, quite unlike that of the
female. It is in reality the nightingale of India. Just as the
nightingale is agitated and noisy in the spring, so is the cry of the
koel at the approach of the rainy season, which is the spring of
Hindustan. Its cry is exceedingly pleasant and penetrating, and the
bird begins its exhilaration (<i>mast&#299;</i>) when the mangoes
ripen. It frequently sits on the mango-trees, and is delighted with the
colour and scent of the mango. A strange thing about the koel is that
it does not bring up its young from the egg, but, finding the nest of
the crow unguarded at the time of laying, it breaks the crow&rsquo;s
eggs with its beak, throws them out, and lays its own in the place of
them, and flies off. The crow, thinking the eggs its own, hatches the
young and brings them up. I have myself seen this strange affair at
Allahabad.</p>
<p class="par">On the night of <i>Kams&#863;hamba</i> (Wednesday), the
29th, the camp was on the bank of the Mah&#299;, and the entertainment
of <i>Mub&#257;raks&#863;hamba</i> was held there. Two springs appeared
on the bank of the Mah&#299;, that had very clear water, so much so
that if a poppy-seed fell into them the whole of it was visible. All
that day I passed with the ladies. As it was a pleasant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb8" href="#v2pb8" name="v2pb8">8</a>]</span>place
to walk about in, I ordered them to build a raised seat round each of
the springs. On Friday I fished in the Mah&#299;, and large fish with
scales fell into the net. I first told my son,
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, to try his sword on them. After this I
ordered the Am&#299;rs to strike them with the swords they had in their
belts. My son&rsquo;s sword cut better than all of theirs. These fish
were divided among the servants who were present. On the eve of
Saturday, the 1st of Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, marching from the
above-mentioned stage, I ordered<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9272src"
href="#xd24e9272" name="xd24e9272src">16</a> the mace-bearers
(<i>yas&#257;wul&#257;n</i>) and <i>taw&#257;chiy&#257;n</i> to collect
the widows and poor people from the villages on the road and near it,
and bring them before me, so that I might bestow charity on them with
my own hand, which would be an occupation, and the helpless ones might
also find grace. What better occupation could there be than this? On
Monday, the 3rd, S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K. &#703;Arab, and Himmat K.,
and other servants who belonged to the Deccan and Gujarat, had the good
fortune to kiss the threshold. The holy men and the possessors of
blessing (faqirs, etc.) who lived at Ahmadabad paid their respects to
me. On Tuesday, the 4th, the bank of the river at
Mahm&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d became the alighting place. Rustam K., whom
my son, S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, had left in the Government of
Gujarat, was honoured by paying his respects. The entertainment of
Thursday, the 6th, was held on the bank of the K&#257;nkriya tank.
N&#257;hir K., according to order, came from the Deccan and raised the
head of honour with the good fortune of prostrating himself before
me.</p>
<p class="par">A diamond ring was presented to my son,
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, as part of the offering of Qutbu-l-mulk. It
was of the value of 1,000 muhars, and on it there appeared three
letters of equal size and of good form, such that they made the word
Lillahi (for God). This diamond had been sent, as it was reckoned one
of the marvels of the world. In fact, veins and scratches are flaws in
precious stones, but it was generally thought that the marks on this
one were fabricated. Moreover, the diamond did not come from any
celebrated mine. As my son, S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, wished that it
should be sent to my brother, Sh&#257;h <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb9" href="#v2pb9" name="v2pb9">9</a>]</span>&#703;Abb&#257;s, as a
souvenir of the conquest of the Deccan it was sent to the Shah along
with other gifts.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9289src" href="#xd24e9289"
name="xd24e9289src">17</a></p>
<p class="par">On this day I presented Brikha R&#257;y
<i>b&#257;d-far&#363;s&#863;h</i> (panegyrist) with Rs. 1,000. He is a
Gujarat&#299; by origin, and is fully versed in the chronicles and
circumstances of that country. His name was
B&#363;n&#7789;&#257;&mdash;that is, a sapling (<i>nih&#257;l</i>). It
seemed to me that it was anomalous to call an old man
B&#363;n&#7789;&#257;, especially now that he had become verdant
(<i>sar-sabz</i>) and fruit-bearing through the irrigation
(<i>sah&#803;&#257;b</i>, literally, cloud, or mirage) of our kindness.
I therefore ordered that henceforth he should be called Brikha
R&#257;y. Brikha means &ldquo;tree&rdquo; in Hind&#299;. On Friday, the
7th of the aforesaid month, corresponding with the 1st
Jum&#257;da-l-awwal, at a chosen propitious hour, I entered the city of
Ahmadabad with all enjoyment. At the time of mounting, my son of
prosperous fortune, S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, had brought 20,000
<i>charan</i>, or Rs. 5,000, for the <i>nis&#804;&#257;r</i>
(scattering), and I scattered them as I hastened to the palace. When I
alighted there he laid before me by way of an offering a jewelled
<i>&#7789;urra</i> (aigrette) of the value of Rs. 25,000, and those of
his officers whom he had left in this Subah also presented offerings.
They altogether amounted to nearly Rs. 40,000. As it was represented to
me that K&#863;hw&#257;ja Beg M&#299;rz&#257; Safaw&#299; had reached
the neighbourhood of the forgiveness of God&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, had
died&mdash;at Ah&#803;madnagar, I promoted to a mansab of 2,000
personal and horse, original and increased, K&#863;hanjar K., whom he
had adopted as his son, and, indeed, held dearer than a son of his
loins, and who was in truth, an intelligent, ambitious youth, and a
servant worthy of patronage, and entrusted him with the charge of the
fort of Ahmadnagar. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb10" href=
"#v2pb10" name="v2pb10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In these days, in consequence of the great heat and the
corruption of the air, sickness had broken out among the people, and of
those in the city and the camp there were few who for two or three days
had not been ill. Inflammatory fever or pains in the limbs attacked
them, and in the course of two or three days they became exceedingly
ill&mdash;so much so that even after recovery they remained for a long
time weak and languid. They mostly at last recovered, so that but few
were in danger of their lives. I heard from old men who resided in this
country that thirty years before this the same kind of fever prevailed,
and passed away happily. Anyhow, there appeared some deterioration in
the climate of Gujarat, and I much regretted having come here. I trust
that the great and glorious God, in His mercy and grace, will lift up
this burden, which is a source of uneasiness to my mind, from off the
people. On <i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i> (Thursday), the 13th,
Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, s. M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, was promoted to the mansab of 1,500 personal
and horse, and presented with a standard, and appointed faujd&#257;r of
Sark&#257;r Pa&#7789;an. Sayyid Niz&#803;&#257;m, faujd&#257;r of
Sark&#257;r Lucknow, was raised to the man&#7779;ab of 1,000 personal
and 700 horse. The man&#7779;ab of &#703;Al&#299; Qul&#299; Darman, who
was attached to the province of Qandahar, at the request of
Bah&#257;dur K., the governor thereof, was ordered to be 1,000 personal
and 700 horse. Sayyid Hizbar K. B&#257;rha was dignified with the
man&#7779;ab of 1,000 personal and 400 horse. I promoted Zabardast K.
to the rank of 800 personal and 350 horse. On this day Q&#257;sim
K&#863;hw&#257;ja of Dihb&#299;d<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9344src"
href="#xd24e9344" name="xd24e9344src">18</a> had sent from
M&#257;-war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr (Transoxiana) by the hand of one of his
tribesmen by way of supplication five <i>t&#363;yg&#863;h&#363;n</i>
(white) falcons. One died on the road, and four arrived at Ujjain in
safety. I ordered them to hand over the sum of Rs. 5,000 to someone
among them, that he might purchase and take with him whatever things
would be agreeable to the K&#863;hw&#257;ja, and gave a reward of Rs.
1,000 to himself. At this time K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;Alam, who had been
sent as ambassador to the ruler of Persia, sent an
<i>&#257;s&#863;hy&#257;n&#299;</i> falcon (bird from the nest), which

Ab&#363;-&#7779;-&#7778;&#257;lih&#803;, a relation (? son-in-law) of
the deceased M&#299;rz&#257; Y&#363;suf K., came from the Deccan by
order, and enjoyed the good fortune of kissing the threshold. He
presented as an offering 100 <i>muhars</i><a class="noteref" id=

K.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9386src" href="#xd24e9386" name=

K&#863;h&#257;n, by means of the patronage of H.M. (Akbar), had risen
to nobility, and attained to the man&#7779;ab of 5,000. Without doubt
he was a good M&#299;r, and held his many servants in good order. A
number of relations gathered round him. He died<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e9392src" href="#xd24e9392" name="xd24e9392src">24</a> in the
Deccan. Although he left many sons, who obtained favours in
consideration of former services, special attention was paid to the
development of his eldest son. In a short time I advanced him to the
rank of nobility. Certainly there is a great difference between him and
his father.</p>
<p class="par">On <i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i> (Thursday), the
27th, I presented H&#803;ak&#299;m Mas&#299;h&#803;u-z-zam&#257;n with
20,000 <i>darbs</i> (8 anna pieces), and to H&#803;ak&#299;m
R&#363;h&#803;u-llah 100 <i>muhars</i> and Rs. 1,000. As he had
thoroughly diagnosed my constitution, he perceived that the climate of
Gujarat was very inimical to it. He said: &ldquo;As soon as you
moderate your habit of taking wine and opium, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb12" href="#v2pb12" name=

disappear.&rdquo; Indeed, when I in one day diminished (the quantity I
took of) both of them, there was a great gain on that first day. On
<i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i> (Thursday), the 3rd
K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d, Qizilb&#257;s&#863;h K. was promoted to the
man&#7779;ab, original and increased, of 1,500 personal and 1,200
horse. A report was received from Gajpat K., superintendent of the
elephant stables, and Bal&#363;ch K., chief huntsman (<i>Qar&#257;wul
Beg</i>), that up to this time sixty-nine elephants, male and female,
had been caught. Whatever took place after this would be reported. I
ordered them to beware not to take old or small elephants; but with
this exception they should catch all they saw, male or female. On
Monday, the 14th,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9416src" href="#xd24e9416"
name="xd24e9416src">25</a> the sum of Rs. 2,000 was presented for

good horses of the J&#257;m which had been presented to me, was given
to R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo. I made a present of Rs. 1,000 to
Bal&#363;ch K., the chief huntsman, who is engaged in capturing
elephants. On Tuesday, 15th, I found I had a severe headache, which at

and after midnight crop-sickness<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9419src"

end of the day, the fever diminished, and, after asking the advice of
my doctors, I took my usual number of cups on the third night. Although
they urged me to take some broth of pulse and rice, I could not make up
my mind to do so. Since I arrived at the age of discretion, I never
remember having taken <i>b&#363;g&#863;h&#257;n</i><a class="noteref"

and hope that I may not want it in future. When they brought food for
me this day, I had no inclination for it. In short, for three days and
two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb13" href="#v2pb13" name=

for a day and a night, and my weakness was such that it appeared as if
I had been confined to bed for a long time, I had no appetite left, and
had no inclination towards food.</p>
<p class="par">I<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9443src" href="#xd24e9443"
name="xd24e9443src">28</a> am amazed to think what pleasure or goodness
the founder of this city could have seen in a spot so devoid of the
favour (of God) as to build a city on it. After him, others, too, have
passed their lives in precious trouble in this dustbin. Its air is
poisonous, and its soil has little water, and is of sand and dust, as
has already<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9446src" href="#xd24e9446" name=
"xd24e9446src">29</a> been described. Its water is very bad and
unpalatable, and the river, which is by the side of the city, is always
dry except in the rainy season. Its wells are mostly salt and bitter,
and the tanks in the neighbourhood of the city have become like
buttermilk from washermen&rsquo;s soap. The upper classes who have some
property have made reservoirs in their houses, which they fill with
rainwater in the rainy season, and they drink that water until the next
year. The evils of water to which the air never penetrates, and which
has no way for the vapour to come out by, are evident. Outside the
city, in place of green grass and flowers, all is an open plain full of
thorn-brakes (<i>zaqq&#363;m</i>), and as for the breeze that blows off
the thorns, its excellence is known:</p>

contains all these varieties. If the rainy season had not prevented me,
I would not have delayed one day in this abode of trouble, but, like
Solomon, would have seated myself on the throne of the wind, and
hastened out, and released the people of God from this pain and
trouble. As the men of this city are exceedingly weak-hearted and
wretched, in order to guard against any of the men from the camp

oppression, I, from the date on which I entered the city,
notwithstanding the heat of the air, every day, after completing the
midday prayer, went and sat in the <i>Jharoka</i>. It was towards the

watch-men (<i>yas&#257;wul</i>), or <i>chobd&#257;rs</i>
(mace-bearers). For the sake of administering justice, I <span class=

three sidereal hours and listened to the cries for redress, and ordered
punishments on the oppressors according to their faults and crimes.
Even in the time of weakness I have gone every day to the
<i>jharoka</i>, though in great pain and sorrow, according to my fixed

wakefulness of heart in calling God to mind. God forbid that this life

contracted fever, my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, who is close to my

days he could not come to pay his respects. He came on Thursday, the

so that if anyone had not explained the matter, one might have supposed
he had been ill for a month or more. I am grateful that at last all
ended <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb15" href="#v2pb15" name=

had come from &#298;r&#257;n&mdash;a summary of what had happened to
him has been already written&mdash;was honoured with the mansab of
1,500 personal and 200 horse. On this day, in consequence of the
weakness I suffered from, I bestowed as alms on deserving people an
elephant, a horse, and varieties of quadrupeds, with a quantity of gold
and silver and other valuable things. Most of my servants also brought
alms according to their means. I told them that if their object was to
parade their loyalty, their proceeding was not acceptable, and if they
were acting from genuine piety there was no need for bringing their
alms into the Presence; they could secretly and personally distribute
them to the poor and needy. On <i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i>
(Thursday), the 7th T&#299;r, Divine month, &#7778;&#257;diq K.
Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal

being honoured with a standard and an elephant, he took leave for the

<p class="par">At this time it was represented to me that the

<p class="par first">Of those who were present at the entertainment who

Ah&#803;mad Beg K., governor of Kashmir. His sons, who were of the
house-born ones of the Court, and on whose foreheads the signs of
intelligence and zeal were manifest, obtained suitable mansabs, and
were sent to do duty in the &#7778;uba of Bangas&#863;h and Kabul. His

Thursday, the 14th, K&#863;hw&#257;ja B&#257;q&#299; K., who was
adorned with the high qualities of dignity, honour, generosity, and
valour, under whose rule was one of the th&#257;nas of the country of

original and increased, and the title of B&#257;q&#299; K. R&#257;y
Kahn&#363;r (Kunwar?), who was formerly D&#299;w&#257;n of Gujarat, was
chosen for the d&#299;w&#257;nship of M&#257;lwa.</p>
<p class="par">At this time the pairing of the <i>s&#257;ras</i>, which
I had never seen before, and is reported never to have been seen by
man, was witnessed by me. The <i>s&#257;ras</i> is a creature of the
crane genus, but somewhat larger.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9555src"
href="#xd24e9555" name="xd24e9555src">36</a> On the top of the head it
has no feathers, and the skin is drawn over the bones of the head. From
the back of the eye to six finger-breadths of the neck it is red. They
mostly live in pairs on the plains, but are occasionally seen in
flocks. People bring a pair in from the fields, and keep them in their
houses, and they become familiar with men. In fact, there was a pair of
<i>s&#257;ras</i> in my establishment to which I had given the names of
Lail&#257; and Majn&#363;n. One day a eunuch informed me that (the) two
had paired in his presence. I ordered that if they showed an
inclination to pair again they should inform me. At dawn he came and
told me that they were about to pair again. I immediately hastened to
look on. The female having straightened its legs bent down a little:
the male then lifted up one of its feet from the ground and placed it
on her back, and afterwards the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb17"
href="#v2pb17" name="v2pb17">17</a>]</span>second foot, and,
immediately seating himself on her back, paired with her. He then came
down, and, stretching out his neck, put his beak to the ground, and
walked once round the female. It is possible they may have an egg and
produce a young one. Many strange tales of the affection of the
<i>s&#257;ras</i> for its mate have been heard. The following case has
been recorded because it is very strange. Qiy&#257;m K., who is one of
the k&#863;h&#257;naz&#257;ds (houseborn ones) of this Court, and is
well acquainted with the arts of hunting and scouting, informed me that
one day he had gone out to hunt, and found a <i>s&#257;ras</i> sitting.
When he approached, it got up and went off. From its manner of walking
he perceived signs of weakness and pain. He went to the place where it
had been sitting, and saw some bones and a handful of feathers on which
it had been sitting. He threw a net round it, and drew himself into a
corner, and it tried to go and sit in the same place. Its foot was
caught in the net, and he went forward and seized it. It appeared
extremely light, and when he looked minutely he saw there were no
feathers on its breast and belly: its flesh and skin had separated, and
there were maggots. Moreover, there was no sign of flesh left on any of
its members: a handful of feathers and bone came into his hand. It was
clear that its mate had died, and that it had sate there from the day
it lost its companion.</p>

<p class="par first">Himmat K., who is one of my best servants, and

"xd24e9590src">37</a> pargana he had seen a pair of <i>s&#257;ras</i>
on the bank of a tank. One of his gunners shot one of them, and in the

href="#v2pb18" name="v2pb18">18</a>]</span>two or three days at that
place, and its mate continually walked round it, and uttered cries and
lamentation. &ldquo;My heart,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ached at its
distress, but there was no remedy for it save regret.&rdquo; By chance,
twenty-five days afterwards, he passed by the same spot, and asked the
inhabitants what had become of that <i>s&#257;ras</i>. They said it
died on the same day, and there were still remains of feathers and
bones on the spot. He went there himself, and saw it was as they said.
There are many tales of this kind among the people, which it would take
too long to tell.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 16th, there came the news of the death
of R&#257;wat S&#863;hankar, who was one of those on duty in
Bih&#257;r. M&#257;n Singh, his eldest son, was raised to the
man&#7779;ab of 2,000 personal and 600 horse: his other sons and
connections were also raised in man&#7779;ab, and were directed to obey
him. On Thursday, the 21st, the elephant B&#257;van,<a class="noteref"

of my catch, which had been left in the pargana of Doh&#803;ad to be
tamed, was brought to Court. I ordered him to be kept near the jharoka
on the river side, that he might be constantly under my eye. In the
elephant-stables of H.M. Akbar the largest elephant I saw was Durjan
S&#257;l. It was long the premier elephant. Its height was 4 yards
(<i>dara&#703;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e9613src" href=

<i>Il&#257;h&#299; gaz</i>, which is 8 yards and 3 fingers of the
ordinary <i>gaz</i>. At present, among the elephants of my
establishment, the largest athlete is &#703;&#256;lam-Gajr&#257;j,
which H.M. Akbar himself had caught. It is the chief of my special
elephants. Its height is 4&#8539; yards, or 7 yards and 7
fingers<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9631src" href="#xd24e9631" name=
"xd24e9631src">41</a> of the ordinary yard. The ordinary <i>gaz</i> has
been fixed at 24 fingers&rsquo; breadth of an average-sized man, and
the <i>Il&#257;h&#299; gaz</i> is 40 fingers&rsquo; breadth.</p>
<p class="par">On this day Muz&#804;affar K., who had been promoted to
the Subadarship of Thatta (Sind), had the good fortune to kiss the

is not a greater Zamindar than this in the country of Gujarat. His
country is close to the sea. Bih&#257;r&#299; and the J&#257;m are from
one stem. They were united ten generations ago. As far as territory and
forces go, the standing of Bih&#257;r&#299; is greater than that of the
J&#257;m. They say that he never came to see any of the Sultans of
Gujarat. Sul&#7789;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d had sent an army against
him, but in the fight the army of Mah&#803;m&#363;d was defeated. At
the time when K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am went to conquer the fort
of J&#363;n&#257;ga&#7771;h in the country of S&#363;rat, Nann&#363;,
who was called Sul&#7789;&#257;n Muz&#803;affar, and gave himself out
as heir to the kingdom, was passing his days in a state of misery under
the protection of the zamindars. After this the J&#257;m was defeated
in battle with the victorious (Royal) army, and Nann&#363; took refuge
with R&#257;y Bih&#257;r&#299;. K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am
demanded Nann&#363; from R&#257;y Bih&#257;r&#299;, and as he could not
oppose the Royal army, he gave him up, and by this piece of loyalty was
saved from the blows of the victorious army. At the time<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e9659src" href="#xd24e9659" name=
"xd24e9659src">44</a> when Ahmadabad was adorned by the presence of the
retinue of fortune for a short time, he did not come to wait on me. His
country was somewhat distant, and time did not admit of the appointing
of a force (against him). When it happened that I returned there, my
son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n appointed Raja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t with
an army (for this purpose), and he, seeing his own safety in coming in
hastened to receive the honour of kissing the threshold, giving 200

name="v2pb20">20</a>]</span>Rs. 2,000 as naz&#817;r, and 100 horses.
However, there was not one of his horses that I approved of. His age
appeared to me to be more than eighty<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e9667src" href="#xd24e9667" name="xd24e9667src">45</a> years, and
he himself said he was ninety. In his senses and powers there was no
appearance of decay. Among his men there was an old man with white
beard, moustaches, and eyebrows. He said that R&#257;y Bih&#257;r&#299;
remembered him when he (the old man) was a child (infant), and that he
had grown up from childhood in his service.</p>

comparison between his work and that of his father (<i>i.e.</i>, he is
far better than his father). One cannot put them into the same
category. My connection was based on my having reared him. From his
earliest years up to the present time I have always looked after him,

the art of drawing is unique in his generation. In the time of my
father&rsquo;s reign and my own these two have had no third. As regards
myself, my liking for painting and my practice in judging it have
arrived at such a point that when any work is brought before me, either
of deceased artists or of those of the present day, without the names
being told me, I say on the spur of the moment that it is the work of
such and such a man. And if there be a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

many portraits, and each face be the work of a different master, I can

has put in the eye and eyebrow of a face, I can perceive whose work the
original face is, and who has painted the eye and eyebrows.</p>
<p class="par">On the eve of Sunday, the 31st of the month of T&#299;r,

<p class="par">On Thursday, the 10th, R&#257;y Bih&#257;r&#299; was
exalted with the favour of a male and a female elephant, a jewelled
dagger, and four rings, of red ruby and yellow ruby (topaz), sapphire,
and emerald. Before this, the &#256;t&#257;l&#299;q J&#257;n-sip&#257;r
(life-jeoparding), K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n
(&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m), Commander-in-Chief, by order, had sent
a force under the leadership of his son Amru-llah<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e9716src" href="#xd24e9716" name="xd24e9716src">53</a> towards
Gondw&#257;na, in order to seize the diamond mine of
Bar&#257;kar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9719src" href="#xd24e9719"
name="xd24e9719src">54</a> (?) that was in the possession of
Panj&#363;, a Zamindar of Khandesh. On this day a report came from him
that the aforesaid Zamindar, knowing that opposition to the victorious
army was beyond his power, had made an offering of the mine,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb22" href="#v2pb22" name=
"v2pb22">22</a>]</span>and a royal superintendent had been appointed to
manage it. The diamonds of that place are superior in kind and beauty
to all other kinds of diamonds, and much esteemed by jewellers. They
are of good shape, and larger, and superior. Of the second rank is the
mine of Kokhra,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9724src" href="#xd24e9724"
name="xd24e9724src">55</a> which is on the borders of Bihar; but the
diamonds of that place are not obtained from the mine, but from a river
which in the rainy season comes down in flood from the hills. Before
that they dam it up, and when the flood has passed over the dam and
there is little water, a number of men who are skilled in this art go
into the river bed and bring out the diamonds. It is now three years
since this country came into the possession of the State. The Zamindar
of the place is in confinement. The climate of that land is excessively
poisonous, and strangers cannot live there. The third place is in the
province of the Karnatik (Carnatic), near the frontier of
Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk. At a distance of 50 <i>koss</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd24e9729src" href="#xd24e9729" name="xd24e9729src">56</a> there
are four mines. Many very fine<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9736src"
href="#xd24e9736" name="xd24e9736src">57</a> diamonds are obtained
there.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 10th, N&#257;hir K. was promoted to the
man&#7779;ab of 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse, and he was presented
with an elephant. Makt&#363;b K., superintendent of the
<i>Kutub-k&#863;h&#257;na</i> (library), was given the man&#7779;ab of
1,500 personal. As I had ordered that on the S&#863;hab-i-Bar&#257;t
they should place lamps round the K&#257;nkr&#299;ya tank, at the end
of the day on Monday, the 14th Sha&#703;b&#257;n, I went out to look at
them. The buildings all round the tank they had arranged with lanterns
of different colours and all kinds of artifices that are practicable
with lamps, and fireworks. Although at this season there were
continually clouds and rain, by God&rsquo;s favour from the beginning
of the night the air had become clear, and not a trace of cloud
remained, and the lights shone just as one could wish. My domestic
servants were regaled with the cups of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb23" href="#v2pb23" name="v2pb23">23</a>]</span>joy. I ordered them
to light lamps in the same manner on the eve of Friday, and a strange
thing was that at the close of the day of Thursday, the 17th, it
continually rained (<i>mutta&#7779;il b&#257;r&#299;dag&#299;</i>), but
at the time of lighting the lamps the rain ceased, and the show was
well seen. On this day I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula presented an offering
of a <i>qut&#804;b&#299;</i> (?) sapphire exceedingly delicate, and an
elephant without tusks with silver housings. As it was handsome-looking
and of good shape, it was put among my private elephants. On the bank
of the K&#257;nkr&#299;ya tank a <i>sany&#257;s&#299;</i>, one of the
most austere sects of Hindus, had made a hut after the dervish manner,
and lived as a hermit. As I was always inclined to associate with
dervishes, I hastened without ceremony to interview him, and for a
while enjoyed his society. He was not wanting in information and
reasonableness, and was well informed according to the rules of his own
faith in the doctrines of Sufism. He had conformed to the ways of
people of religious poverty and mortification, and given up all desires
and ambitions. One might say that a better than he of his class was
never seen.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 21st (Amurd&#257;d), the
<i>s&#257;ras</i>, the pairing of which has been related in the
preceding pages, collected together some straw and rubbish in the
little garden, and laid first of all one egg. On the third day
(afterwards) it laid a second egg. This pair of <i>s&#257;ras</i> were
caught when they were a month old,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9771src"
href="#xd24e9771" name="xd24e9771src">58</a> and had been in my
establishment for five years. After five and a half years they paired,
and continued doing so for a month; on the 21st of the month of
Amurd&#257;d, which the Hindus call S&#257;wan (Sr&#257;van) the hen
laid the eggs. The female used to sit on the eggs the whole night
alone, and the male stood near her on guard. It was so alert that it
was impossible for any living thing to pass near her. Once a large
weasel made its appearance, and he ran at it with the greatest
impetuosity, and did not stop until the weasel got into a hole. When
the sun illuminated the world with his rays, the male went to the
female and pecked her back with his beak. The female then rose, and the
male sate in her place. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb24" href=
"#v2pb24" name="v2pb24">24</a>]</span>She returned, and in the same
manner made him rise, and seated herself. In short, the female sits the
whole night, and takes care of the eggs, and by day the male and female
sit by turns. When they rise and sit down they take great precautions
that no harm shall come to the eggs.</p>
<p class="par">During this season, as there was still some of the
hunting time left, Gajpat K., the darogha, and Bal&#363;ch K., the head
huntsman, had been left to hunt elephants, to catch as many as they
possibly could. In the same manner the huntsmen of my son,
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, had also been employed. On this day they
came and waited on me. Altogether 185 elephants had been caught, male
and female: of these, 73 were males and 112 females. Out of these, 47
males and 75 females, or 122, the imperial huntsmen and faujd&#257;rs
had secured, while the huntsmen and elephant-drivers of my son,
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, had taken 26 males and 37 females, or 63
altogether.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 24th, I went to see the
B&#257;g&#863;h-i-Fath&#803;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9782src" href=
"#xd24e9782" name="xd24e9782src">59</a> and spent two days there in
enjoyment and pleasure. At the end of the day on Saturday I returned to
the palace. As &#256;&#7779;af K. had represented that his
<i>h&#803;aw&#299;l&#299;</i> (house) garden was exceedingly green and
pleasant, and all sorts of flowers and scented plants had bloomed
there, at his request I went to it on <i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i>
(Thursday), the 31st. In truth, it was a very nice villa, and I was
much pleased. His offering of jewels and jewelled things, and cloth, of
the value of Rs. 35,000, was accepted. Muz&#804;affar K. was favoured
with a dress of honour and an elephant, and, as before, was entrusted
with the charge of the government of Thatta (Sind). My brother
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s sent a letter with some trifling
presents by &#703;Abdu-l-Kar&#299;m of G&#299;l&#257;n, who had come
with merchandise from &#298;r&#257;n. On this day I presented him with
a dress of honour and an elephant, and gave him leave to return, and
sent an answer to the Shah&rsquo;s letter with a memorandum.
K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam was also honoured with a gracious
farman and a special dress of honour. Friday was the 1st of the month
of S&#863;hahr&#299;war. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb25" href=
"#v2pb25" name="v2pb25">25</a>]</span>From Sunday, the 3rd, till the
eve of Thursday (the 7th) rain fell. It is strange that on other days
the pair of <i>s&#257;ras</i> sate on the eggs five or six times in
turn, but during this twenty-four hours, when there was constant rain
and the air was somewhat cold, the male, in order to keep the eggs
warm, sate from early in the morning until midday, and from that time
until the next morning the female sat without an interval, for fear
that in rising and sitting again the cold air should affect them, and
the eggs become wet and be spoilt. Briefly, men are led by the guidance
of Reason, and animals according to the Divine wisdom implanted in them
by Nature. Stranger still is it that at first they keep their eggs
together underneath the breast, and after fourteen or fifteen days have
passed they leave a little space between them, for fear the heat should
become too great from their contact with each other. Many become addled
in consequence of (too great) heat.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 7th, with great joy and congratulation,
the advance camp was started towards Agra. The astrologers and
astronomers had already fixed the auspicious hour for the march. As
excessive rain fell, the main camp could not cross the river of
Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d (the V&#257;trak) and the Mah&#299; at
this hour. Out of necessity, the advanced camp was started at the
appointed hour, and the 21st S&#863;hahr&#299;war<a class="noteref" id=

for the march of the main camp.</p>
<p class="par">My son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n took upon himself the
responsibility of the conquest of the fort of K&#257;ngra, over which
the noose of victory had not been thrown by any of the Sultans of lofty
dignity, and an army under the leadership of R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Mal,
s. R&#257;ja B&#257;so, and Taq&#299;, who was one of his attached
servants, had before this been sent for that purpose. It was now clear
that the conquest could not be achieved by the force that had been
previously appointed. R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t,<a class="noteref"

force that had previously been sent, were appointed to the duty. As the
hour for departure was fixed on this day, the aforesaid
(Bikram&#257;j&#299;t) presented as an offering a rosary of emeralds of
the value of Rs. 10,000. He was honoured with the gift of a dress of
honour and a sword, and took his leave for this duty. As he had not a
jagir in that Subah, my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n asked for him as
a jagir the pargana of Barh&#257;na (?),<a class="noteref" id=

appointed Himmat K. to the faujd&#257;rship of the Sarkar of
Bhar&#363;ch (Broach) and that neighbourhood, with the gift of a horse
and a special <i>parm narm</i> (shawl), and despatched him. The pargana
of Bhar&#363;ch (Broach) was also bestowed on him as jagir. R&#257;y
Prith&#299; Chand, who had been nominated for service at K&#257;ngra,
was promoted to the rank of 700 and 450 horse. As the anniversary of
S&#863;haik&#863;h Muh&#803;ammad G&#863;haus&#804;<a class="noteref"

Muz&#804;affar, s. Bah&#257;duru-l-mulk, who was attached to the
Deccan, was given the man&#7779;ab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse.</p>
<p class="par">As the events of twelve years of
<i>Jah&#257;ng&#299;r-n&#257;ma</i> have been recorded, I
ordered<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9849src" href="#xd24e9849" name=
"xd24e9849src">67</a> the clerks of my private library to make one
volume of these twelve years, and to prepare a number of copies so that
I might give them to my special servants, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb27" href="#v2pb27" name=

so that administrators (arb&#257;b-i-daulat) and the auspicious might
adopt them as their code. On Friday, the 8th,<a class="noteref" id=

news-writers had written the whole and made a volume, which he produced
to me. As it was the first copy that had been prepared, I gave it to my
son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, whom I consider to be in all respects
the first of my sons. On the back of it I wrote with my own hand that I
had given it him on a certain day and at a certain place. I hope that
the favour of the receipt of those writings which are intended for the
satisfaction of the creature and for supplication to the Creator may be
a cause of good fortune.</p>
<p class="par">On Tuesday, the 12th, Subh&#803;&#257;n Qul&#299;,
huntsman, was brought to punishment. The details of this are that he is
the son of H&#803;&#257;j&#299; Jam&#257;l Bal&#363;ch, who was my
father&rsquo;s best huntsman, and after his (the
King&rsquo;s<span class="corr" id="xd24e9859" title="Source: death)">)
death,</span> he entered the service of Isl&#257;m K., and went with
him to Bengal. Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n, on account of his
(Subh&#803;&#257;n Qul&#299;&rsquo;s) connection with this Court,
showed him proper consideration, and considering him trustworthy always
kept him near him when travelling or hunting. &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n,
the Afghan, who for many years passed his days in that Subah in
disobedience and stubbornness, and the end of whose affairs has been
recorded in the preceding pages, being much troubled by Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, sent someone to this wretch, and made proposals for
his murdering Isl&#257;m. He undertook the business, and associated two
or three other men with himself. By chance, before the futile idea of
this ungrateful fellow was carried into execution, one of them came and
informed him (Isl&#257;m K.). Isl&#257;m K. immediately seized and
imprisoned the scoundrel. After the latter&rsquo;s death he came to
Court. As his brothers and relatives were included among the huntsmen,
he was also ordered to be enrolled among them. At this time the son
(Ikr&#257;m K.) of Isl&#257;m K. represented in an enigmatical way that
he was unworthy of service near my person. After explanation it
appeared what the charge was. Notwithstanding this, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb28" href="#v2pb28" name="v2pb28">28</a>]</span>as
his brothers strenuously represented that there was only suspicion, and
Bal&#363;ch K., the head huntsman, became security for him, I forbore
to put him to death, and ordered him to do duty with Bal&#363;ch K. In
spite of this grace and the gift of his life, without cause or motive
he fled from the Court, and went to Agra and that neighbourhood.
Bal&#363;ch K., having become his security, was ordered to produce him.
He sent people to inquire for him. In one of the villages of Agra,
which was not wanting in sedition, and is called Jahanda,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e9864src" href="#xd24e9864" name=
"xd24e9864src">69</a> the brother of Bal&#363;ch K&#863;h&#257;n, who
had gone to make inquiries, found him, and although he endeavoured to
bring him by persuasion to Court, he would in no way consent, and the
people rose to assist him.</p>
<p class="par">Being without remedy, he (the brother) went to
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n at Agra, and told him the circumstances.
He sent a detachment against that village to take him by force and
bring him. The people of the village, seeing their own ruin in the
mirror of the case, handed him over to him. This day he came to Court
in chains. I gave an order for his execution. The man of wrath (the
executioner) took him to the place of punishment with all haste. After
a while, through the intercession of one of the courtiers, I gave him
his life, and ordered his feet to be cut off, but according to his
destiny (what was written on his head) before the order arrived he had
been punished. Although that doomed man was deserving of punishment,
yet I regretted<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9869src" href="#xd24e9869"
name="xd24e9869src">70</a> the circumstance, and directed that whenever
an order was given for anyone&rsquo;s execution, notwithstanding that
the command were imperative, they should wait till sunset before
putting him to death. If up to that time no order for release arrived,
he should without fail be capitally punished.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday there was a great commotion in the River
Mah&#299;, and very large waves were visible. Although there formerly
had been (great) rains, yet such violence, or even the half of it, had
never been known. From the beginning of the day the flood began to
come, and at the end of the day began to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

inhabitants of this city represented that once, during the government
of Murtaz&#803;&#257; K. (Far&#299;d Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#299;), a
similar great flood had occurred. But with that exception they did not

<p class="par">In the middle of the garden of K&#863;hurram

a tablet of marble and fix it firmly in that place, so that one could
lean one&rsquo;s back on it and sit there. At this time an impromptu

it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb31" href="#v2pb31" name=

bazaar was arranged in the private palace. Up to this time the custom
has been for the people of the bazaar and the artificers of the city in
every place to bring their shops according to order into the courtyard
of the palace (royal abode, whether in camp or elsewhere), and bring
jewels and jewelled things and various kinds of cloth and other goods
such as are sold in the bazaar. It occurred to me that if a bazaar were
prepared in the night-time, and a number of lamps were arranged in
front of the shops, it would look well. Undoubtedly it came off well
and was unusual. Going round all the shops, whatever jewels and
jewelled things pleased me I bought. I gave some present from each shop
to Mull&#257; Am&#299;r&#299;, and he received so many things that he
was unable to hold them.</p>
<p class="par">On <i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i> (Thursday) the 21st
of the Divine month of S&#863;hahr&#299;war, in the thirteenth year
from my accession, corresponding with the 22nd Ramaz&#803;&#257;n
(September 2, 1618), in the Hijr&#299; year 1027, when two and a half
hours of day had passed, in prosperity and happiness, the standards of
purpose turned towards the capital of Agra. From the palace as far as
the K&#257;nkr&#299;ya tank, the place of alighting, I passed along in
the usual manner, scattering money
(<i>nis&#804;&#257;r-kun&#257;n</i>). On the same day the feast of my
solar weighment took place, and according to solar reckoning the
fiftieth year of the age of his suppliant at the throne of God
commenced auspiciously. According to my usual rule I weighed myself
against gold and other valuables. I scattered pearls and golden roses,
and looking at night at the show of lamps passed my time in the private
apartments of the royal abode in enjoyment. On Friday, the 22nd, I
ordered that all the S&#863;haik&#863;hs and men of piety who lived in
the city should be brought in order that they might break their
fast<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9990src" href="#xd24e9990" name=

(Thursday) the 21st, the s&#257;ras hatched one young one, and on the

after thirty-four<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10024src" href=

"xd24e10027src">83</a> larger than the young of a goose, or equal to
the young of the peafowl at the age of a month. Their skin was of a
blue colour. On the first day they ate nothing, and from the second day
the mother, taking small locusts (or grasshoppers) in her mouth,
sometimes fed them like a pigeon, or sometimes like a fowl threw them
before them for them to pick up of themselves. If the locust were
small, it went off well, but if it were large, she sometimes made two
or three pieces of it so that the young ones might eat it with ease. As
I had a great liking for seeing them I ordered them to be brought
before me with every precaution that no harm might happen to them.
After I had seen them I ordered them to be taken back to the same
little garden inside <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb33" href=
"#v2pb33" name="v2pb33">33</a>]</span>the royal enclosure, and to be
preserved with the greatest care, and that they should be brought to me

<p class="par">On this day H&#803;ak&#299;m R&#363;h&#803;u-llah was

M. S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, came from his jagir and waited on me. On

at the village of Kaj.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10043src" href=
"#xd24e10043" name="xd24e10043src">84</a> On Wednesday, the 27th, I
pitched my camp on the bank of the river at
Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d called the &#298;zak<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e10046src" href="#xd24e10046" name="xd24e10046src">85</a> (now
called Meshva). As the water and air of Ah&#803;mad&#257;b&#257;d were
very bad, Mah&#803;m&#363;d B&#299;gara, by the advice of his
physicians, founded a city on the bank of the aforesaid river and lived
there. After he conquered Ch&#257;mp&#257;ner, he made that place his
capital, and until the time of Mah&#803;m&#363;d the martyred<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e10049src" href="#xd24e10049" name=
"xd24e10049src">86</a> the rulers of Gujarat chiefly lived there. This
Mah&#803;m&#363;d was the last of the Sultans of Gujarat, and he took
up his residence at Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d. Undoubtedly the
water and air of Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d have no resemblance to
those of Ah&#803;mad&#257;b&#257;d. By way of testing this I ordered
them to hang up a sheep on the bank of the K&#257;nkr&#299;ya tank
after taking off its skin, and at the same time one at
Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d, that the difference of the air might
be ascertained. It happened that after seven <i>ghar&#299;s</i> of day
had passed in that place (Ah&#803;mad&#257;b&#257;d) they hung up the
sheep. When three <i>ghar&#299;s</i> of day remained it became so
changed and putrid that it was difficult to pass near it. They hung up
the sheep at Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d in the morning, and it was
altogether unchanged until the evening, and began to be putrid when one
and a half watches of night had passed. Briefly, in the neighbourhood
of Ah&#803;mad&#257;b&#257;d it became putrid in eight sidereal hours,
and in Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d in fourteen hours.</p>

gift of an elephant, a horse, and a special <i>parm narm</i> (shawl),
and given leave to depart, and the Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; officers
who were attached to that Subah were presented with horses and dresses

S&#863;hahr&#299;war, corresponding with 1st Shaww&#257;l, R&#257;y
Bih&#257;r&#299; was honoured with the bestowal of a dress of honour, a
jewelled sword and a special horse, and took leave to go to his native
place. His sons were also honoured with horses and dresses of honour.
On Saturday I ordered Sayyid Muh&#803;ammad, grandson<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e10065src" href="#xd24e10065" name="xd24e10065src">87</a> (?)
of S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam, to ask for whatever he desired
without concealment, and I took an oath on the Qoran to this effect. He
said that as I had sworn on the Qoran he would ask for a Qoran that he
might always have it by him, and that the merit of reading it might
accrue to His Majesty. Accordingly, I gave the M&#299;r a Qoran in
Y&#257;q&#363;t&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10074src" href=
"#xd24e10074" name="xd24e10074src">88</a> handwriting. It was a small,
elegant<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10077src" href="#xd24e10077" name=
"xd24e10077src">89</a> volume, and was the wonder of the age. On the
back of it I wrote with my own hand that I had made this gift on a
certain day and in a certain place to Sayyid Muh&#803;ammad. The real
reason for this is that the M&#299;r is of an exceedingly good
disposition, endowed with personal nobility and acquired excellencies,
of good manners and approved ways, with a very pleasing face and open
forehead. I have never seen a man of this country of such a pleasing
disposition as the M&#299;r. I told him to translate this Qoran into
plain language without ornament, and that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb35" href="#v2pb35" name="v2pb35">35</a>]</span>without occupying
himself with explanations or fine language he<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e10094src" href="#xd24e10094" name="xd24e10094src">90</a> should
translate the Qoran in simple language
(<i>lugh&#257;t-i-r&#299;k&#863;hta</i>) word by word into Persian, and
should not add one letter to its exact purport. After he had completed
it he should send it by his son Jal&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n Sayyid to the
Court. The M&#299;r&rsquo;s son is also a young man of external and
internal intelligence. The signs of piety and blessedness are distinct
on his forehead. The M&#299;r is proud of his son, and in truth he is
worthy, as he is an excellent youth. As I had repeatedly shown kindness
to the holy men of Gujarat, according to their merits, I again bestowed
on each cash and jewels, and dismissed them to their homes.</p>
<p class="par">As the climate<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10103src"
href="#xd24e10103" name="xd24e10103src">91</a> of this country was not
suited to my temperament, the physicians thought it right that I should
decrease somewhat my usual number of cups. According to their advice I
began to decrease their number, and in the course of a week reduced
them by the weight of one cup. At first it was six cups every evening,
each cup being 7&frac12; <i>tola</i>, or altogether 45 <i>tolas</i>.
The wine was usually mixed with water. Now I drank six cups, each of
which was 6 <i>tolas</i> and 3 <i>m&#257;s&#863;has</i>,<a class=

this date I have reached the commencement of my fiftieth year, and one
day, in consequence of excessive fever (<i>d&#363;d u

testimony&mdash;by God&rsquo;s help, seek the confirmation of my
resolve from my father&rsquo;s holy elements, and renounce the practice
(of shooting). As soon as this thought occurred to me, my illness and
trouble disappeared. I revived, and opened my mouth to praise God, and
tasted the joy of thanksgiving for His mercies. I hope that I shall be

hasten to that quarter. Some of the diamonds that Ibr&#257;h&#299;m

he might be unkind to it and it might be destroyed. I accordingly
ordered them to keep the male separately, and not allow it near its
young ones. I now ordered by way of experiment that it should be
allowed near them, that the real degree of its unkindness and affection
might be ascertained. After allowing it, he displayed much attachment
and kindness, and his affection was found to be no less than that of
the female; I thus knew that this performance was out of real love. On
Thursday, the 11th, there was a halt, and at the end of the day I went
to hunt with cheetahs, and two black buck, four does, and a

and the people of God were afflicted by it, I ordered my son
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n to save them from its wickedness. He, as
ordered, shot it with his gun, and brought it to me at night. I ordered
them to skin it in my presence. Although large in appearance, as it was
thin, it turned out less in weight than the large tigers I had myself
killed. On Monday, the 15th, and Tuesday, the 16th, I went to shoot
nilgaw, and on each day shot two blue bulls. On Thursday, the 18th, on
the bank of a tank at which I pitched, a feast of cups was held. Rare

chief huntsman, and had given him the rank of 600 personal and 150
horse. &#703;&#298;zzat<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10275src" href=

and 800 horse. Kif&#257;yat K., Diwan of Gujarat, had an elephant given

K., <span class="corr" id="xd24e10279" title=
"Source: Bakshi">Bakhshi</span> of that Subah. On Friday, the 19th, I
went to hunt, and killed a blue bull. I do not remember a bullet
passing through a large male nilgaw. Many have passed through females.
On this day, at a distance of forty-five paces (<i>qadam</i>), it went
through both skins. In the language of hunters a <i>qadam</i> means two
feet (<i>g&#257;m</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e10290src" href=
"#xd24e10290" name="xd24e10290src">103</a>) placed one in front of the
other. On Sunday, the 21st, I enjoyed myself with hawking, and ordered
M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam, D&#257;r&#257;b K., M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n,
and other servants to go and shoot as many nilgaw as they could. They
killed nineteen head, male and female. Ten head of antelope were also
caught with cheetahs. Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K., Bakhshi of the Deccan, was,
at the request of the Commander-in-Chief, K&#863;h&#257;n
K&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and
200 horse. On Monday, the 22nd, a march was made, and on Tuesday, the
23rd, I again marched. The huntsmen represented that there had been
seen in the neighbourhood a tigress with three cubs. As it was on the
road I went myself after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb41" href=
"#v2pb41" name="v2pb41">41</a>]</span>them and shot all four, and then
went on to the next stage. I crossed the Mah&#299; by the bridge that
had been made. Though there were no boats on this river of which a
bridge could be made, and the water was very deep and flowing rapidly,
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan, the chief Bakhshi, had built
with great exertions a very strong bridge two or<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e10298src" href="#xd24e10298" name="xd24e10298src">104</a> three
days before. Its length was 140 yards and its breadth 4 yards
(<i>dara&#703;</i>). By way of testing it I ordered the elephant Gun
Sundar K&#863;h&#257;&#7779;&#7779; which is one of the large and
strong elephants, with three females, to be sent across it. It was so
firmly built that its supports did not shake with the weight of
elephants of mountainous form.</p>
<p class="par">From the most honoured lips of my father I heard as
follows: &ldquo;In early youth I had taken two or three cups (of wine),
and had mounted a full-blooded (<i>mast</i>) elephant. Though I was in
my senses, and the elephant in very good training, and was under my
control, I pretended that I was out of my senses, and that the elephant
was refractory and vicious, and that I was making him charge the
people. After that, I sent for another elephant, and made the two
fight. They fought, and in doing so went to the head of the bridge that
had been made over the Jumna. It happened that the other elephant ran
away, and as there was no other escape, he went towards the bridge. The
elephant I was on pursued him, and although I had him under control,
and he would have halted at the slightest signal, I thought that if I
held him back from the bridge the people would regard those drunken
ways (of mine) as a sham, and would believe that neither was I beside
myself, nor was the elephant violent and headstrong. Such pretences on
the part of kings are disapproved of, and so after imploring the aid of
God&mdash;Glory be to Him&mdash;I did not restrain my elephant. Both of
them went upon the bridge, and as it was made of boats, whenever an
elephant put his forefeet on the edge of a boat, half of it sank, and
the other half stood up. At each step there came the thought that the
lashings might give way. People on seeing this were overwhelmed in the
sea <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb42" href="#v2pb42" name=
"v2pb42">42</a>]</span>of perplexity and alarm. As the care and
guardianship of the Great and Glorious God is ever and in all places
the protection of this suppliant, both elephants crossed the bridge in
safety.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10311src" href="#xd24e10311"
name="xd24e10311src">105</a></p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 25th, a wine-feast was held on the
banks of the Mah&#299;, and some of my intimate servants who had
admittance to such assemblies had their hearts delighted by brimming
cups and ample favours. Certainly it was an entrancing halting-ground.
I stayed here four days for two reasons&mdash;first, because of the
beauty of the spot, and secondly in order that the people might not be
confused in crossing the river.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 28th, I marched from the bank of the
Mah&#299;. On Monday I marched again. On this day a strange sight was
witnessed. The pair of s&#257;ras that had had young ones had been
brought from Ah&#803;mad&#257;b&#257;d on Thursday (the 25th). In the
Court of the royal enclosure, which had been placed on the bank of a
tank, they were walking about with their young ones. By chance both the
male and female raised a cry, and a pair of wild s&#257;ras hearing it,
and crying out from the other side of the tank, came flying towards
them. The male with the male, and the female with the female, engaged
in a fight, and although some people were standing about, the birds
paid no heed to them. The eunuchs who had been told off to protect them
hastened to seize them. One clung to the male and the other to the
female. He who had caught the male kept hold of it after much
struggling, but the one who seized the female could not hold her, and
she escaped from his hand. I with my own hand put rings in his beak and
on his legs, and set him free. Both went and settled in their own
place.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10318src" href="#xd24e10318" name=
"xd24e10318src">106</a> Whenever the domestic s&#257;ras raised a cry
they responded. I saw a sight of this kind in wild antelopes when I had
gone to hunt in the pargana of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb43"
href="#v2pb43" name="v2pb43">43</a>]</span>Karn&#257;l. About thirty of
my huntsmen and servants were in attendance when a black buck with some
does came in sight, and we let loose the decoy-antelope<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e10323src" href="#xd24e10323" name=
"xd24e10323src">107</a> to fight him. They butted two or three times,
and then the decoy came back. A second time I wanted to put a noose on
its horns and to let it go, that it might capture (the wild one).
Meanwhile the wild antelope, in the excess of its rage, not looking at
the crowd of men, ran without regard to anything, and butting the tame
buck two or three times fought with it till it fled. The wild antelope
thereupon made its escape.</p>
<p class="par">On this day news came of the death of &#703;In&#257;yat
K. He was one of my intimate attendants. As he was addicted to opium,
and when he had the chance, to drinking as well, by degrees he became
maddened with wine. As he was weakly built, he took more than he could
digest, and was attacked by the disease of diarrh&oelig;a, and in this
weak state he two or three times fainted. By my order H&#803;ak&#299;m
Rukn&#257; applied remedies, but whatever methods were resorted to gave
no profit. At the same time a strange hunger came over him, and
although the doctor exerted himself in order that he should not eat
more than once in twenty-four hours, he could not restrain himself. He
also would throw<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10328src" href=
"#xd24e10328" name="xd24e10328src">108</a> himself like a madman on
water and fire until he fell into a bad<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e10331src" href="#xd24e10331" name="xd24e10331src">109</a> state
of body. At last he became dropsical, and exceedingly low and weak.
Some days before this he had petitioned that he might go to Agra. I
ordered him to come into my presence and obtain leave. They put him
into a palanquin and brought him. He appeared so low and weak that I
was astonished.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;He was skin drawn over bones.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Or rather his bones, too, had dissolved. Though
painters have striven much in drawing an emaciated face, yet I have
never seen anything like this, nor even approaching to it. Good God,
can a son of man come to such a shape <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

two couplets of Ust&#257;d<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10343src" href=

<p class="line">Nor, from weakness, does my soul see a refuge</p>
<p class="line">Where it may for a while rest on my lips.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">As it was a very extraordinary case I directed
painters to take his portrait. In fact, I found him wonderfully
changed. I said to him: &ldquo;Beware; in your present state do not for
a moment forget God, nor despair of His mercy! If Death grant you
quarter (<i>am&#257;n</i>), regard the reprieve as a time for
apologizing and for amendment. If your life has come to its close,
consider every moment passed in remembrance of God as gain. Trouble not
your head about those you are leaving behind. A slight claim of service
is a great thing with us.&rdquo; As they had spoken to me about his
poverty, I gave him Rs. 2,000 for road-expenses, and let him go. Next
day he travelled the road of non-existence.</p>

M&#257;nab<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10365src" href="#xd24e10365"

son of K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, obtained the mansab of 1,000
personal and 300 horse. Dil&#299;r K., who was one of the jagirdars of
Gujarat, I presented with a horse and an elephant. Ran-b&#257;z K., s.
S&#863;h&#257;h-b&#257;z K. K&#257;mb&#363;, came by order from the
Deccan, and was promoted to the post of Bakhshi and Recorder of the
army of Bangas&#863;h, and his mansab was fixed at 800 personal and 400
horse. I marched on Friday, the 3rd. At this stage<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e10385src" href="#xd24e10385" name="xd24e10385src">114</a>
Prince S&#863;huj&#257;&#703;, the beloved son (liver-corner) of my son
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, who was being brought up in the chaste lap
of N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam, and towards whom I have so much affection
that he is dearer to me than life, was attacked by a specially
infantile disease which they call
&ldquo;ummu-&#7779;-&#7779;iby&#257;n,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e10389src" href="#xd24e10389" name="xd24e10389src">115</a> and for
a long time his senses left him. Although experienced people devised
many remedies, they were unprofitable, and his insensibility
(<i>b&#299;-h&#363;s&#863;h&#299;</i>) took away my senses
(<i>h&#363;s&#863;h</i>). As visible remedies were hopeless, by way of
humility and submission I rubbed the head of supplication on the Court
of the gracious Ruler who cherishes his slaves, and begged for the
child&rsquo;s recovery. In this state it occurred to me that as I had
made a vow<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10398src" href="#xd24e10398"
name="xd24e10398src">116</a> to my God that after I had passed my
fiftieth year, this suppliant would give up hunting with bullet and
gun, and would injure no creature with his own hand, if for the sake of
his safety I were to give up shooting from the present date, it were
possible that his life would become the means of preserving the lives
of many animals, and God Almighty might give him to me. In fine, with
true purpose, and sincere belief I vowed<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e10401src" href="#xd24e10401" name="xd24e10401src">117</a> to God
that I would thenceforward not harm any living thing with my own hand.
By the grace of Allah his illness diminished. At the time when this
suppliant was in his mother&rsquo;s womb, one day I made no movement
after the manner that other children make. The attendants were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb46" href="#v2pb46" name=
"v2pb46">46</a>]</span>amazed, and inquiring into the cause stated the
case to my father (Akbar). At that time my father was engaged in
hunting with cheetahs. As that day was a Friday, for the purpose of my
safety he made a vow that during his life he would not hunt with
cheetahs on a Friday. Till the end of his life he remained firm in this
determination, and I also in obedience to him until now have never
hunted with cheetahs on a Friday. Finally, on account of the weakness
of the light of my eye, S&#863;h&#257;h S&#863;huj&#257;&#703;, for
three days I halted at this stage, that God Almighty might give him his
natural<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10410src" href="#xd24e10410" name=
"xd24e10410src">118</a> life.</p>
<p class="par">On Tuesday, the 7th, I marched. One day the son of
H&#803;ak&#299;m<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10415src" href=
"#xd24e10415" name="xd24e10415src">119</a> &#703;&#256;l&#299; was
praising the milk of a camel. It occurred to me that if I could
continue that for some days, it was possible that it might do some
good, and it might prove agreeable to me. &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n had a Persian camel in milk, and I took a little of it.
Contrary to the milk of other camels, which is not devoid of saltness,
it appeared to my taste sweet and delicious, and now for a month past I
have been drinking every day a cup of it, equal in quantity to half a
water-cup, and it is clearly advantageous, for it quenches my thirst.
It is strange that two years ago &#256;&#7779;af K. bought this camel,
but at that time it had not a young one, and had no sign of milk. At
this time by chance milk flowed from its dugs. They gave it every day
to drink four seers of cow&rsquo;s milk with five seers of wheat, one
seer of black<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10418src" href="#xd24e10418"
name="xd24e10418src">120</a> sugar, and one seer of fennel
(<i>b&#257;dy&#257;n</i>), to make its milk delicious, sweet, and
profitable. Certainly it suited me admirably, and was to my taste. By
way of testing it, I sent for some cow&rsquo;s and buffalo&rsquo;s
milk, and tasted all three. There was no comparison in sweetness and
flavour with the milk of this camel. I ordered them to give the same
kind of food to some other female camels, that it might become clear
whether the purity was in consequence of eating good food, or whether
it was due to the natural sweetness of this (particular) camel&rsquo;s
milk.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10426src" href="#xd24e10426" name=

<p class="par">On Wednesday, the 8th, I marched, and halted on the 9th.
The royal tent was pitched near a large tank.
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n presented me with a boat made after the
Kashm&#299;r fashion, the sitting-place of which they had made of
silver. At the end of that day I embarked in that boat and went round
the tank. On this day &#703;&#256;bid K., Bakhshi of Bangas&#863;h, who
had been summoned, came and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold,
and was honoured with the post of D&#299;w&#257;n-i-buy&#363;t&#257;t.
Sar-far&#257;z K&#863;han, who was one of the auxiliaries of Gujarat,
received a standard, a private <i>tipch&#257;q</i> horse, and an

name="xd24e10445src">124</a> the 15th &#256;b&#257;n, the camp was

was necessary that the Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba entertainment should
as far as possible be arranged for on the bank of a river and a clean
place, and there was in this neighbourhood no spot which met those
requirements, there was no help for it but to order a start when half
of the night of Thursday (<i>i.e.</i>, Wednesday), the 16th, had
passed, and when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb48" href="#v2pb48"

bank of the tank of B&#257;kh&#363;r. At the end of the day, the feast
of cups was held and I presented cups to some of my private servants.
On Friday, the 17th, I ordered a march. Kes&#863;ho D&#257;s
M&#257;r&#363; is a jagirdar in that neighbourhood. According to
orders, he came from the Deccan, and was honoured by doing homage.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 18th (&#256;b&#257;n), the camp was at
R&#257;mga&#7771;h. For some nights before this there appeared, at
three <i>ghar&#299;s</i> before sunrise, in the atmosphere, a
(luminous) vapour in the shape of a pillar.<a class="noteref" id=

succeeding night it rose a <i>ghar&#299;</i> earlier. When it assumed
its full form, it took the shape of a spear (<i>h&#803;arba</i>), thin
at the two ends, and thick in the middle. It was curved like a sickle,
and had its back to the south, and its face to the north. It now showed
itself a watch (<i>pahar</i>) before sunrise. Astronomers took its
shape and size by the astrolabe, and ascertained that with differences
of appearance (?) it extended over twenty-four degrees. It moved in
high heaven, but it had a movement of its own, differing from that of
high heaven, for it was first in Scorpio and afterwards in Libra. Its
declination (<i>h&#803;arakat-i-&#703;arz&#803;</i>?) was mainly
southerly. Astrologers call such a phenomenon a spear
(<i>h&#803;arba</i>) in their books, and have written that its
appearance portends weakness to the kings of Arabia, and points to
their enemies prevailing over them. God knows! Sixteen nights after
this phenomenon, a star showed itself in the same quarter. Its head was
luminous, and its tail was two or three yards long, but the tail was
not luminous. It has now appeared for eight nights; when it disappears,
the fact will be noticed, as well as the results of it.</p>

Hijr&#299; year 1026&mdash;that is, last year&mdash;the number of mice
in Qandahar and the neighbourhood was so great that they destroyed all
the crops and grain and cultivation and the fruits of the trees of the
province, so that there had been no produce. They (the mice) cut off
the ears of corn and ate them. When the cultivators gathered their
crops, before they were threshed and cleaned, another<a class="noteref"

was destroyed, so that perhaps one-fourth of the crops only came to
hand. In the same way no vestige was left of the melons (melon-beds) or
garden produce. After some time the mice disappeared. <span class=

<p class="par">As my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n had not made a
birthday entertainment for his son (Aurangz&#299;b), he petitioned at
Ujain, which is the place of his jagir, that the Thursday entertainment
of the 30th should be held at his abode. Of necessity, having consented
to the carrying out of his wish, the day was passed in enjoyment at his
quarters. My private servants who have the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> into
this kind of parties and assemblies were delighted with brimming cups.
My son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n brought that auspicious child before
me, and, presenting as offerings a tray of jewels, and jewelled
ornaments, and fifty elephants, thirty male and twenty female, asked me
for a name for him. Please God it will be given him in a favourable
hour. Of his elephants seven were included in my private stud; the rest
were distributed among the faujd&#257;rs. The value of the offerings
that were accepted will be Rs. 200,000.</p>
<p class="par">On this day &#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daula
(Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain Anj&#363;) came from his jagir,
and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. He gave eighty-one
<i>muhars</i> as <i>naz&#817;r</i>, and an elephant as an offering.
Q&#257;sim K., whom I had dismissed from the government of Bengal, had
been sent for, and having had the good fortune to do homage, presented
1,000 <i>muhars</i> as <i>naz&#817;r</i>. On Friday, the 1st of
&#256;z&#817;ar, I amused myself with hawking. As the retinue passed
along, a field of millet (<i>jw&#257;r</i>) was met with. Though
generally a stem has only one head, each of them had twelve. I was
astonished, and at this time the tale of &ldquo;The King and the
Gardener&rdquo; occurred to me.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first"><span class="sc">Tale of &ldquo;The King and the
Gardener.</span>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10544src" href=

<p class="par">A King came to the gate of a garden in the heat of the
day. He saw an old gardener standing at the gate, and asked him if
there were any pomegranates in the garden. He said: &ldquo;There
are.&rdquo; He told him to bring a cup of pomegranate juice. The
gardener had a daughter adorned with grace of person, and beauty of
disposition. He made a sign to her to bring the pomegranate juice. The
girl went and at once <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb51" href=
"#v2pb51" name="v2pb51">51</a>]</span>brought a cup full of pomegranate
juice, and placed some leaves upon it. The King took it from her hand
and drank it. Then he asked the girl what was her reason for placing
leaves on the top of the juice. She, with an eloquent tongue and a
sweet voice, represented that it was not wise at once to drink off a
quantity of liquid when he was bathed in perspiration, and in such a
hot air. On this account she had placed the leaves on the liquid by way
of precaution, so that he might drink it slowly. The King was greatly
pleased with her sweet ways, and it crossed his mind to admit the girl
into his Palace. After this he asked the gardener: &ldquo;How much
profit do you derive from this garden every year?&rdquo; He answered:
&ldquo;Three hundred <i>d&#299;n&#257;rs</i>.&rdquo; The King asked:
&ldquo;What do you pay the Diwan (tax-collector)?&rdquo; He answered:
&ldquo;The King takes nothing from the trees, but takes a tenth of the
cultivated crops.&rdquo; It came into the King&rsquo;s mind that there
were in his dominions many gardens and countless trees. If he were to
get a tenth of the garden produce as well, it would amount to a large
sum, and there would be no great loss to the cultivator. Hereafter he
would order a tax to be levied on garden produce. He said then:
&ldquo;Bring me a little more pomegranate juice.&rdquo; The girl went,
and after a long time brought a small quantity. The King said:
&ldquo;The first time thou camest quickly, and broughtest more. This
time thou didst stay a long time, and broughtest less.&rdquo; The girl
said: &ldquo;The first time I had filled the cup with the juice of one
pomegranate, and brought it; this time I pressed out five or six
pomegranates and did not get as much juice.&rdquo; The astonishment of
the King increased. The gardener represented: &ldquo;The blessing of
produce depends on the goodwill of the King. It occurs to me that you
must be a King. At the time when you inquired of me the income from the
garden, your disposition must have changed. Consequently the blessing
passed away from the fruit.&rdquo; The Sultan was impressed, and drove
that idea out of his heart. He then said: &ldquo;Bring me once more a
cup of pomegranate juice.&rdquo; The girl went again, and quickly
bringing a cup full to the brim, gave it, smiling and gladly, into the
Sultan&rsquo;s hand. He praised the intelligence of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb52" href="#v2pb52" name=
"v2pb52">52</a>]</span>gardener, and explained the actual state of
affairs, and begged the girl of him in marriage, and married her.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">This true tale of that truth-preserving King has
remained as a memento on the page of time. In truth, the manifestation
of such spiritual (?)<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10559src" href=
"#xd24e10559" name="xd24e10559src">133</a> results is the mark of good
intentions, and the fruit of justice. Whenever all the energies and
purposes of justice-observing Kings are devoted to the comfort of the
people and the contentment of their subjects, the manifestations of
well-being and the productions of fields and gardens are not far off.
God be praised that in this age-enduring State no tax has ever been
levied on the fruit of trees, and is not levied now. In the whole of
the dominion not a <i>d&#257;m</i> nor one grain

order that whoever makes a garden on arable land, its produce is
exempted. I trust that God (to whom be glory!) will always incline this

<p class="par first">On Saturday, for the second time, my desire for
the company of Jadr&#363;p increased. After performing the midday
devotions, I embarked in a boat and hastened to meet him, and at the
close of day I ran and enjoyed his society in the retirement of his
cell. I heard many sublime words of religious duties and knowledge of
divine things. Without immoderate praise, he sets forth clearly the
doctrines of wholesome Sufism, and one can find delight in his society.
He is sixty years old. He was twenty-two years of age, when, forsaking
all external attachments, he placed the foot of determination on the
highroad of asceticism, and for thirty-eight years he had lived in the
garment of nakedness. When I took leave he said: &ldquo;In what
language can I return thanks for this gift of Allah that I am engaged
in the reign of such a just King in the worship of my own Deity in ease
and contentment, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb53" href="#v2pb53"
name="v2pb53">53</a>]</span>and that the dust of discomposure from any
accident settles not on the skirt of my purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 3rd, marching from K&#257;liy&#257;daha,
I encamped at the village of Q&#257;simkhera. I employed myself on the
road in hawking. By chance a crane rose, and the
<i>t&#363;yg&#863;h&#363;n</i> falcon, of which I am very fond, was let
fly after it. The crane sought to escape, and the falcon soared and
flew so high as to disappear from sight. Although the huntsmen and the
head-beaters ran after it in all directions, they found no trace of it,
and it was impossible for the falcon to be caught in such a desert.
Las&#863;hkar M&#299;r Kas&#863;hm&#299;r&#299;, who is the head of the
Kashmir huntsmen, in whose charge the falcon was, ran in a bewildered
state through the desert in all directions without finding a sign or
trace. Suddenly he saw a tree in the distance, and when he went up to
it he found the falcon sitting on the end of a branch. Showing a
domestic fowl, he called to the falcon. Three <i>ghar&#299;s</i> more
had not passed when he brought it to me. This gift from the hidden
world, that had entered into the thoughts of no one, increased the joy
of my mind. Increasing his mansab as a reward for this service, I gave
him a horse and a dress of honour.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 4th, Tuesday, the 5th, Wednesday, the
6th, I marched continuously, and, halting on Thursday, the 7th, I
arranged a feast of pleasure on the bank of a tank. N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n
Begam had been ill for some time, and the physicians who had the good
fortune to be chosen to attend on her, <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e10599" title="Source: Musalmans">Musulmans</span> and Hindus,
perceived no gain from all the medicines they gave her, and confessed
their helplessness in treating her. At this time H&#803;ak&#299;m
R&#363;h&#803;u-llah began to wait upon her, and undertook (to find) a
remedy. By the aid of God (Glory be to His name!), in a short time she
quite recovered. In reward for this excellent service I increased his
mansab and bestowed on the H&#803;ak&#299;m three villages in his
native country as his private property, and an order was given that he
should be weighed against silver, which should be given him as a
reward. From Friday, the 8th, until Sunday,<a class="noteref" id=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb54" href="#v2pb54" name=

day up to the end of the stage employed myself in hunting with hawks
and falcons (<i>b&#257;z u jurra</i>). Many <i>durr&#257;j</i>
(partridges) were caught. On last Sunday, Kunwar Karan, s.
R&#257;n&#257; Amar Singh, having enjoyed the good fortune of kissing
the ground, presented his congratulations on the conquest of the
Deccan, offering 100 <i>muhars</i> and Rs. 1,000 by way of
<i>naz&#817;r</i>, and the value of Rs. 21,000 in jewelled vessels,
with some horses and elephants as <i>p&#299;s&#863;hkas&#863;h</i>. The
horses and elephants I returned to him, and the rest was accepted. The
next day I presented him with a dress of honour. To M&#299;r
S&#863;har&#299;f, Vakil of Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk, and to Ir&#257;dat K.,
the chief butler, an elephant each was given. Sayyid Hizabr K. was
given the faujd&#257;ri of Mew&#257;t, and his mansab, original and
increased, was fixed at 1,000 personal and 500 horse. Having selected
Sayyid Mub&#257;rak for the charge of the fort of Roht&#257;s, I
conferred on him the mansab of 500 personal and 200 horse. On Thursday,
the 14th, the camp was pitched on the bank of the tank of the village
of Sandh&#257;ra, and the feast of cups was held, and chosen servants
were made happy with cups of pleasure. The birds of chase, &ldquo;that
had been shut up in Agra to moult&rdquo; (<i>ba-kur&#299;z basta
b&#363;dand</i>), were this day brought to me by K&#863;hw&#257;ja
&#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f, the Chief Fowler. Picking out those that
were fit for my own use, the rest were given to the Am&#299;rs and
other servants.</p>
<p class="par">On this day the news of the revolt and ingratitude for
favours of R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Mal, s. R&#257;ja B&#257;so, came to my
ear. B&#257;so had several<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10629src" href=
"#xd24e10629" name="xd24e10629src">137</a> sons. Although the
above-mentioned was the eldest, his father mostly kept him in
confinement on account of his evil thoughts and mischievous tendencies,
and regarded him with displeasure. After his (B&#257;so&rsquo;s) death,
as this wretch was the eldest, and he had no other capable or
intelligent son, I, looking to the services rendered by R&#257;ja
B&#257;so, for the purpose of preserving the family of a Zamindar, and
the protection of his hereditary property and country, conferred on
this wretch the title of Raja, with a mansab of 2,000, and gave him the
position and jagir of his father, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb55"
href="#v2pb55" name="v2pb55">55</a>]</span>which the latter had
obtained by his loyalty and good service. I also gave him the sums of
money and goods that his father had collected during long years. When
the deceased Murtaz&#803;&#257; K. was sent off on the duty of
conquering K&#257;ngra, as this wretch was the chief Zamindar of that
hill country, he outwardly displayed zeal in the service and loyalty,
and was nominated as an auxiliary. After he reached the spot,
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K. pressed the siege tightly against the garrison.
This evil-minded fellow discovered from the appearance of things that
he would soon be victorious, and began to disagree and be troublesome.
He took off the veil of respect from his face, and proceeded to quarrel
and be hostile to Murtaz&#803;&#257; K.&rsquo;s men. Murtaz&#803;&#257;
K. read the writing of misery and ruin on the page of the
wretch&rsquo;s forehead, and reported unfavourably of him to the Court,
or rather wrote plainly that the signs of rebellion and want of loyalty
were clear in his conduct. As there was there such an officer as
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K. and a large army in the hill-country, the wretch
did not find the time convenient for the preparation of a disturbance.
He sent a report to my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n that
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K., at the instigation of interested parties, had
turned against him, and desired to overthrow and ruin him, and was
accusing him of wrong-doing and rebellion. He hoped that he would
summon him to Court, and thus provide a means for his escape and (the
prolonging of) his life. Although I had every confidence in the words
of Murtaz&#803;&#257; K., yet as he (S&#363;raj Mal) begged to be sent
for to Court, a doubt passed into my mind that possibly
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K., at the instigation of seditious people, might
cause a confusion, and might have accused him without due reflection.
Briefly, at the request of my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, passing
over his offence, I summoned him (S&#363;raj Mal) to Court. Just at
this time Murtaz&#803;&#257; K. died, and the conquest of the fort of
K&#257;ngra was delayed till the dispatch of another leader. When this
seditious fellow arrived at Court, I, under the pressure of affairs,
rapidly encompassed him with favours and sent him off to do duty with
my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n in the conquest of the Deccan. After
this, when the Deccan had come into the possession of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb56" href="#v2pb56" name=
"v2pb56">56</a>]</span>the servants of the enduring State, he, having
acquired influence in my son&rsquo;s service, was appointed to
superintend the taking of the fort of K&#257;ngra. Although the sending
back of this ungrateful and untruthful one into that hill-country
showed a want of caution and care, yet as my son had taken on himself
the responsibility of the undertaking, I was obliged to give in to his
wish and to leave the matter to him. My fortunate son appointed him,
along with one of his own servants of the name of Taq&#299; and a
suitable army of <i>man&#7779;abd&#257;rs</i>,
<i>ah&#803;ad&#299;s</i>, and royal musketeers, as has already been
related summarily in these pages. When he arrived at the place, he
began to show enmity and trickery toward Taq&#299; also, and displayed
his natural disposition. He continually reported unfavourably of him
(Taq&#299;), until he wrote plainly that he could not get on with him,
and that Taq&#299; could not do the work. If another general were
appointed, the fort would be quickly conquered. In fine, he
(S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n) had no choice but to summon Taq&#299; to
Court, and to appoint R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, who was one of
his chief servants, with an army of fresh men on this service. When the
wretch discovered that his stratagems could no longer continue, and his
deceit go no farther, he, before the arrival of Bikram&#257;j&#299;t,
gave leave to a number of the servants of the Court, on the pretence
that they had been on service a long time without proper arrangements
(commissariat), to hasten to their jagirs and provide themselves with
their equipments before the arrival of R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t.
As palpably this came to a dispersion of the forces of the loyal, and
most of them left for their own jagirs, only a few experienced men
remained there. Seeing his opportunity, he showed the signs of revolt
and sedition. Sayyid &#7778;af&#299; B&#257;rha, who was distinguished
for his bravery, with some of his brothers and relatives, advanced the
feet of courage, and tasted the wholesome draught of martyrdom, and
some who were wounded with severe wounds, which are the adornment of
the lions of battle, that rascal took captive from the field of strife
and carried off to his own house of calamity.<a class="noteref" id=

"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb57" href="#v2pb57" name=

stretched out the hand of oppression and possession over the parganas
on the skirts of the hill-country (<i>daman-i-k&#363;h</i>), which
mostly belonged to the jagir of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula, and did not
abate a hair&rsquo;s breadth from attacking and plundering. It is hoped
that with the same swiftness, he will be caught with the reward of his
deeds and the recompense of his actions, and that the spirit<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e10660src" href="#xd24e10660" name=
"xd24e10660src">140</a> of this State will do its work, please God!</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 17th, I crossed Gh&#257;&#7789;&#299;
Ch&#257;n&#7693;&#257;. On Monday, the 18th, the J&#257;n-sip&#257;r
&#256;t&#257;l&#299;q K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n,
Commander-in-Chief, had the honour of kissing the threshold. As he had
been absent from my presence for a long time, and the victorious
retinue was passing by near the Sarkars of Khandesh and
Burh&#257;np&#363;r, he asked to wait upon me, and an order was given
that if his mind were at ease in all respects, he should come
unattended and return quickly. He accordingly came with all speed, and
had the good fortune to pay his respects on this day, and, having been
exalted by the receipt of all kinds of royal favours and kingly
benefits, he presented an offering of 1,000 <i>muhars</i> and Rs.
1,000.</p>
<p class="par">As the camp had undergone great hardship in crossing the
Gh&#257;&#7789;&#299;, I ordered a halt for the refreshment of the
people on Tuesday, the 19th. I marched on Wednesday, the 20th, and on
Thursday, the 21st, halted again and held a feast of cups on the bank
of a river that is known as the Sind.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e10672src" href="#xd24e10672" name="xd24e10672src">141</a> I gave
a special horse, of the name of Sumer, which was one of the finest
horses, to the K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n. In the Hindi
language they call a hill of gold Sumer (Sumeru), and he was called by
this name on account of his colour and size. On Friday, the 22nd, and
Saturday, the 23rd, two successive marches were made. On this day a
wonderful waterfall was seen. The water is exceedingly clear, and pours
down with boiling and noise from a lofty place. On all sides of it
there are halting places <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb58" href=
"#v2pb58" name="v2pb58">58</a>]</span>where one may praise God.
Certainly I have not recently seen such another fine waterfall, and it
is a delightful recreation-place. I was delighted with the spectacle
for a while. On Sunday, the 24th, I halted, and, sitting in a boat on a
tank which was in front of the royal enclosure
(<i>daulat-k&#863;h&#257;na</i>), were shot<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e10680src" href="#xd24e10680" name="xd24e10680src">142</a> ducks
(<i>murg&#863;h&#257;b&#299;</i>). On Monday, the 25th, Tuesday, the
26th, and Wednesday, the 27th, I marched one after the other. I
bestowed on the K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n the
<i>p&#363;st&#299;n</i> (sheep-skin coat) I had on my own person, and
seven horses from my stable, on which I always rode, were also given
him. On Sunday, the 2nd of the Il&#257;h&#299; month of Dai, the royal
standards were raised at the fort of Ranthamb&#363;r. This is one of
the great forts of the Indians. In the time of Sul&#7789;&#257;n
&#703;Al&#257;&#702;u-d-d&#299;n K&#863;halj&#299;, R&#257;y Pitambar
Deo was in possession of it. The Sultan besieged it for a long time,
and conquered it with labour and great exertions, and in the
beginning<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10693src" href="#xd24e10693" name=
"xd24e10693src">143</a> of the reign of H.M. (Akbar)&mdash;may the
light of God be his witness!&mdash;R&#257;y Surjan H&#257;&#7693;&#257;
had it in his possession. He had always 6,000 or 7,000 horse in
attendance on him. That revered one, by the aid of the glorious God,
conquered it in the space of one month and twelve days, and R&#257;y
Surjan, by the guidance of fortune, having had the good fortune to kiss
the threshold, was enrolled among the number of the loyal, and became
one of his respectable and trusted Am&#299;rs. After him his son
R&#257;y Bhoj also was included among the great Am&#299;rs. Now his
grandson, Sar-buland R&#257;y, is among the chief officers. On
Monday,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10696src" href="#xd24e10696" name=
"xd24e10696src">144</a> the 3rd, I went to inspect the fort. There are
two hills close to each other. They call one Ran, and the other
Thanb&#363;r. The fort is built on the top of Thanb&#363;r, and,
putting these two names together, they have called it <span class=
"corr" id="xd24e10699" title=
"Source: Ranthanb&#363;r">Ranthamb&#363;r</span>. Although the fort is
exceedingly strong, and has plenty of water, the hill of Ran is a
specially strong fortress <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb59" href=
"#v2pb59" name="v2pb59">59</a>]</span>(in itself), and the capture of
the fortress depends upon the possession of this hill. Accordingly, my
revered father ordered that they should plant cannon on the top of the
hill of Ran, and aim at (<i>majr&#257; g&#299;rand</i>) the buildings
inside the fort. The first gun they fired reached the square building
(<i>chaukand&#299;</i>)<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10711src" href=
"#xd24e10711" name="xd24e10711src">145</a> of the palace of R&#257;y
Surjan. From the fall of that building, a trembling found its way into
the foundations of his courage, and a great perplexity overpowered his
heart, and thinking he would best consult his own safety in delivering
up the fort, he rubbed the head of worship and humility on the throne
of the king of kings, who forgave faults and accepted excuses.</p>
<p class="par">I had intended to pass the night in the fort, and the
next day to return to camp. As the buildings inside the fort had been
built after the fashion of the Hindus, and the rooms were without air
and with little space, they did not please me, nor was I disposed to
stay there. I saw a bath house, which one of the servants of
Dastam<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10719src" href="#xd24e10719" name=
"xd24e10719src">146</a> K&#863;h&#257;n had built near the wall of the
fort. A little garden and a lodging (<i>nis&#863;h&#299;man</i>) which
overlooks (<i>mus&#863;hrif</i>) the open space is not wanting in space
and air, and there is no better place in the whole fort.<a class=

"xd24e10728src">147</a> Dastam K. was one of the Am&#299;rs of the late
King (Akbar), and from his early years had been brought up in his
service. His connection with him was confidential and intimate. H.M.
had entrusted this fort to him from his exceeding confidence in
him.</p>
<p class="par">After completing my inspection of the fort and houses, I
ordered that they should bring before me the criminals who were
confined in the fort, so that I might look into the case of each of
them and give an order in accordance with justice. In brief, with the
exception of affairs of murder, and of any person through whose release
disturbance or calamity might ensue in the country, I freed them all,
and to each one in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb60" href="#v2pb60"

expenses and dresses<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10735src" href=
"#xd24e10735" name="xd24e10735src">148</a> of honour. On the eve of
Tuesday, the 4th, I returned to the royal abode after a watch and three
gharis had passed. On Sunday (properly Wednesday), the 5th, having
marched nearly 5 koss, I halted on Thursday, the 6th. On this day the
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n presented his offering of
jewels, ornamented vessels, cloth, and an elephant. Of these I chose
whatever pleased me, and returned the rest. What was accepted of his
offering was of the value of Rs. 150,000. On Friday, the 7th, I marched
5 koss. I had before this captured a <i>s&#257;ras</i> with a falcon,
but until now I had never seen the hunting of a
<i>durn&#257;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e10748src" href=
"#xd24e10748" name="xd24e10748src">149</a> (crane). As my son
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n had great pleasure in <i>durn&#257;</i>
hunting with the falcon (<i>s&#863;h&#257;h&#299;n</i>), and his
falcons were well grown, at his request I rode out early in the
morning, and caught one <i>durn&#257;</i> myself, whilst the falcon my
son had on his wrist caught another. Certainly, of all good hunting
amusements, this is the best. I was exceedingly pleased with it.
Although the <i>s&#257;ras</i> is large, it is lazy and heavy on the
wing. The chase of the <i>durn&#257;</i> has no resemblance to it. I
praise the heart and courage of the falcon that can seize such
strong-bodied animals, and with the strength of his talons can subdue
them. H&#803;asan K., the chief <span class="corr" id="xd24e10772"
title="Source: hunstman">huntsman</span> of my son, was honoured with
an elephant, a horse, and a dress of honour, as a reward for this
exhibition of sport, and his son also received a horse and a dress of
honour. On Saturday, the 8th, having marched 4&frac14; koss, I halted
on Sunday, the 9th. On this day the
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, the Commander-in-Chief, having
raised the head of dignity through the gift of a special dress of
honour, a jewelled waist-sword, and a private elephant with trappings,
was reappointed to Khandesh and the Deccan. The mansab of that pillar
of the kingdom, original and increase, was fixed at 7,000 personal and
horse. As he did not get on with Las&#863;hkar K., at his request I
assigned to &#703;&#256;bid K. the duty of
D&#299;w&#257;n-i-buy&#363;t&#257;t,<a class="noteref" id=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb61" href="#v2pb61" name=

personal and 400 horse, as well as a horse, an elephant, and a dress of
honour, sent him to that Subah. On the same day K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n arrived from Kabul, and had the good fortune to pay his
respects, and presented as <i>nazr</i> 1,000 muhars and Rs. 1,000, as
well as an offering of a pearl rosary, fifty horses, ten Persian male
and female camels, and some hawks, and china,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e10793src" href="#xd24e10793" name="xd24e10793src">151</a> and
porcelain (?), and other things. On Monday, the 10th, I marched
3&frac14; koss, and on Tuesday, the 11th, 5&frac34; koss. On this day
the K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n arranged his men before me, and passed
in review a thousand Mug&#863;hal cavalry, most of whom had Turk&#299;
horses, and some &#703;Ir&#257;q and some Mujannas<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e10796src" href="#xd24e10796" name="xd24e10796src">152</a>
horses. Though his troopers had been mostly dispersed, some going into
the service of Mah&#257;bat K. and remaining in that Subah, whilst a
number left him at Lahore and went into different parts of the
dominion, yet he could show this body of well-mounted men. Certainly
the K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n for valour and generalship is one of
the unique of the ages, but alas! I found he had become a decrepit old
man, and his sight was very weak. He has two intelligent young sons,
who are not wanting in reasonableness, but it will certainly be a great
and difficult thing for them to show themselves his equals. On this day
I gave him and his sons dresses of honour and swords. On Sunday, the
12th, traversing 3&frac12; koss, I alighted on the bank of the tank of
M&#257;nd&#363;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10802src" href=
"#xd24e10802" name="xd24e10802src">153</a> In the middle of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb62" href="#v2pb62" name=

the pillars the quatrain of someone had been engraved. I saw it, and
was amazed. In truth, it is a fine verse:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;My congenial friends have left me:</p>
<p class="line">One by one they&rsquo;ve fallen into the hands of

<p class="line">They were poor drinkers at the banquet of life.</p>

</div>
<p class="par first">At this time I also heard another quatrain of the
same description, which I have recorded because it was very well
said:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Alas! that people of intelligence and wisdom
have passed away.</p>
<p class="line">They have been forgotten in the minds of their
contemporaries.</p>
<p class="line">Those who spoke with a hundred tongues</p>
<p class="line">Ah! what heard they that they became silent.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">On Thursday, the 13th, I made a halt.
&#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K., having come from Bangas&#863;h, had
the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Ikr&#257;m K., who was in
charge of the faujd&#257;ri of Fathp&#363;r and the neighbourhood, was
honoured with waiting on me. Khw&#257;ja Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K.,
Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; of the Deccan, was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb63" href="#v2pb63" name=

M&#299;r H&#803;&#257;jj, who is one of the auxiliaries attached to
that Subah, and one of the brave young officers, was promoted to the
title of S&#863;harza (tiger-whelp) K., and received a standard. On
Friday, the 14th, I marched 5&frac14; koss. On Saturday, the 15th,
having marched 3 koss, I halted in the neighbourhood of
Bay&#257;n&#257;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10884src" href=
"#xd24e10884" name="xd24e10884src">155</a> There I hastened with the
ladies to see the spectacle of the top of the fort. Muh&#803;ammad, the
Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; of Hum&#257;y&#363;n, who was entrusted with
the charge of the fort, had built a fine house overlooking the plain,
of great height and with fine air. The tomb of S&#863;haik&#863;h
Bahl&#363;l is also in that neighbourhood, and is not wanting in
excellence. The S&#863;haik&#863;h was the elder brother of
S&#863;haik&#863;h Muh&#803;ammad G&#863;haus&#804;, and was much
versed in the science of incantations by names (of God).
Hum&#257;y&#363;n had great affection for him, and the most perfect
reliance on him. When he conquered the province of Bengal, he took up
his abode there for some time. M&#299;rz&#257; Hind&#257;l, by his
order, had remained<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10887src" href=
"#xd24e10887" name="xd24e10887src">156</a> at Agra. A body of
avaricious servants (<i>qulluq-chiy&#257;n</i>), whose character was
mischievous and seditious, taking to the way of faithlessness, came
from Bengal to the M&#299;rz&#257;, and, working upon his base nature
(shaking the chain of his vile heart), led the M&#299;rz&#257; on the
road of rebellion and ingratitude for favours, and of irrecognition of
duty. The thoughtless M&#299;rz&#257; had the <i>k&#863;hut&#804;ba</i>
recited in his own name (proclaimed himself king), and openly raised
the standard of rebellion and strife. When the royal ear heard what had
taken place from the reports of those who were loyal, he sent
S&#863;haik&#863;h Bahl&#363;l to admonish the M&#299;rz&#257;, and to
turn him back from his vain purpose, and to establish his feet on the
highroad of sincerity and concord. As these wretches had made
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb64" href="#v2pb64" name=
"v2pb64">64</a>]</span>the flavour of royalty sweet to the
M&#299;rz&#257;&rsquo;s palate, he became imbued with futile ideas, and
would not be loyal. At the instigation of these seditious people he
made S&#863;haik&#863;h Bahl&#363;l a martyr with the sword of
recklessness at the Ch&#257;rb&#257;g&#863;h (garden) which H.M.
B&#257;bar had made on the bank of the Jumna. As Muh&#803;ammad
Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; was a disciple of the S&#863;haik&#863;h, he
carried the body into the fort of Bay&#257;n&#257;, and buried it
there.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 16th, marching 4&frac12; koss, I came to
the stage of Barah.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10901src" href=
"#xd24e10901" name="xd24e10901src">157</a> As the garden and well which
had been built by the order of Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;
(Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s mother) in the pargana of J&#363;sat was on
the road, I went to inspect them. Certainly the
<i>b&#257;&#702;ol&#299;</i> (step-well) was a grand building, and had
been built exceedingly well. I ascertained from the officials that a
sum of Rs. 20,000 had been expended on this well. As there was much
game in this neighbourhood, I halted on Monday, the 17th.</p>
<p class="par">On Tuesday, the 18th, marching 3&#8539; koss, the host
of prosperity halted at the village of
D&#257;yarm&#702;a&#702;&#363;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10918src"
href="#xd24e10918" name="xd24e10918src">158</a> On Wednesday, the 19th,
marching 2&frac12; koss, the victorious standards were raised on the
bank of the Lake of Fath&#803;p&#363;r. As at the time when the
conquest of the Deccan was meditated, the stages and distances from
Ranthamb&#363;r to Ujain were recorded, it appears unnecessary to
repeat them. From Ranthamb&#363;r<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10921src"

was a distance of 234 koss, in sixty-three marches and fifty-six halts,
traversed in 119 days, or, according to solar reckoning, in one day
under four months, and by lunar four full months. From the date on
which the army of fortune started from the capital for the conquest of
the R&#257;n&#257; and the acquisition of the Deccan until now, when
the victorious and prosperous standards have been planted again in the
centre of the empire, it is five years and four months. The astrologers
and astronomers chose the day of <i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i>
(Thursday), the 28th of the Divine month of Dai, in my thirteenth year,
corresponding with the last day of the Muh&#803;arram in the Hijr&#299;
year 1028 (January 7, 1619), as the proper time at which to enter the
capital of Agra.</p>
<p class="par">At this time, again, it appeared from the reports of the
loyal that the disease of the plague was prevalent in Agra, so that
daily about 100 people, more or less, were dying of it. Under the
armpits, or in the groin, or below the throat, buboes formed, and they
died. This is the third year that it has raged in the cold weather, and
disappeared in the commencement of the hot season. It is a strange
thing that in these three years the infection has spread to all the
towns and villages in the neighbourhood of Agra, while there has been
no trace of it at Fath&#803;p&#363;r. It has come as far as
Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d, which is 2&frac12; koss from
Fath&#803;p&#363;r, and the people of that place
(Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d) have forsaken their homes and gone to other
villages. There being no choice, and considering the observance of
caution necessary, it was decided that at this propitious<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e10934src" href="#xd24e10934" name=
"xd24e10934src">160</a> hour the victorious army should enter the
inhabited part of Fath&#803;p&#363;r in all joy and auspiciousness, and
after the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb66" href="#v2pb66" name=

auspicious hour had been chosen, I should enter the capital, please the
Almighty and most holy Allah!</p>
<p class="par">The Thursday entertainment took place on the bank of the
Lake of Fath&#803;p&#363;r. As the time for entering the town (of
Fath&#803;p&#363;r) was fixed for the 28th, I halted eight days in this
place. I ordered them to measure the circumference of the
lake,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10941src" href="#xd24e10941" name=
"xd24e10941src">161</a> and it came to 7 koss. At this stage, with the
exception of the revered Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;, who had become very
weak, all the Begams and inhabitants of the enclosure of chastity and
all the palace employ&eacute;s came out to meet me (istiqb&#257;l). The
daughter<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10944src" href="#xd24e10944" name=

s. K&#863;h&#257;n &#256;&#703;z&#804;am, told me a strange and
wonderful tale, and strongly insisted upon its truth. I write it on
account of its strangeness. She said: &ldquo;One day in the courtyard
of the house I saw a mouse rising and falling in a distracted state. It
was running about in every direction after the manner of drunkards, and
did not know where to go. I said to one of my girls: &lsquo;Take it by
the tail and throw it to the cat!&rsquo; The cat was delighted, and
jumped up from its place and seized it in its mouth, but immediately
dropped it and showed disgust. By degrees an expression of pain and
trouble showed itself in its face. The next day it was nearly dead,
when it entered into my mind to give it a little treacle<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e10955src" href="#xd24e10955" name=
"xd24e10955src">163</a> (<i>tiry&#257;q</i>, opium?). When its mouth
was opened, the palate and tongue appeared black. It passed three days
in a state of misery, and on the fourth day came to its senses. After
this the grain (<i>d&#257;na</i>) of the plague (buboes) appeared in
the girl, and from excess of temperature and increase of pain she had
no rest. Her colour became changed&mdash;it was yellow inclining to
black&mdash;and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb67" href=
"#v2pb67" name="v2pb67">67</a>]</span>fever was high (<i>tap
muh&#803;riq gard&#299;d</i>). The next day she vomited<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e10972src" href="#xd24e10972" name=
"xd24e10972src">164</a> and had motions, and died. Seven or eight
people in that household died in the same way, and so many were ill
that I went to the garden from that lodging. Those who were ill died in
the garden, but in that place there were no buboes. In brief, in the
space of eight or nine days seventeen people became travellers on the
road of annihilation.&rdquo; She also said: &ldquo;Those in whom the
buboes appeared, if they called another person for water to drink or
wash in, the latter also caught the infection (<i>sir&#257;yat</i>),
and at last it came to such a pass that through excessive apprehension
no one would come near them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 22nd, K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, who
had had the charge of Agra, having had the good fortune to kiss the
threshold, presented 500 <i>muhars</i> by way of <i>nazr</i>, and Rs.
400<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10992src" href="#xd24e10992" name=

against gold and other things, and his twenty-eighth year according to
the solar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11081src" href="#xd24e11081" name=

day H.M. the revered Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299; (his mother) came from
Agra, and I acquired eternal good fortune from the blessing of waiting
on her. I hope that the shadow of her bringing up and affection may be
perennial on the head of this suppliant. As Ikr&#257;m K., s.
Isl&#257;m K., had performed the duties of faujd&#257;r of this
neighbourhood in a proper manner, I bestowed on him the mansab of 1,500

<p class="par">On this day, going over in detail the buildings of the
palace of the late King (Akbar), I showed them to my son,
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n. Inside of them a large and very clear
reservoir of cut stone has been constructed, and is called the
<i>Kap&#363;r-tal&#257;o</i> (camphor tank). It is a square of 36 yards

By the order of that revered one, the officials of the public treasury
had filled it with <i>ful&#363;s</i> (copper coins) and rupees. It came
to 34 krors, and 48 lakhs, and 46,000 d&#257;ms, and 1,679,400 rupees,
or a total of 10,300,000 (one kror and three lakhs) according to
Hindustani reckoning, and 343,000 <i>t&#363;m&#257;n</i> according to
Persian. For a long time the thirsty-lipped ones of the desert of
desire were satisfied from that fountain of benignity.</p>

Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d. As there was an order that no one should kill
the antelope of that region, in the course of six years many antelope
had come together, and they had grown very tame. On Thursday, the 12th,

Chis&#863;ht&#299;, a little concerning whose blessed qualities has
been written in the preface<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11200src" href=
"#xd24e11200" name="xd24e11200src">175</a> to this record of
prosperity, and the <i>f&#257;tih&#803;a</i> was recited. Although the
manifestation of miracles and wonders is not approved by the elect of
the throne of God, and from humility and a feeling of their low rank
(as saints) they avoid such display, yet occasionally in the excitement
of ecstasy an appearance is manifested unintentionally and without
control,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11208src" href="#xd24e11208" name=
"xd24e11208src">176</a> or for the sake of teaching someone the
exhibition is made. Among these was this, that he before my birth gave
my father the good news of the advent of this suppliant and of my two
brothers. Again, one day my father incidentally asked him how old he
was, and when would he depart to the abiding regions. He replied:
&ldquo;The glorious God knows what is secret and hidden.&rdquo; After
much urgency he indicated this suppliant (Prince Sal&#299;m), and said:
&ldquo;When the Prince, by the instruction of a teacher or in any other
way, shall commit something to memory and shall recite it, this will be
a sign of my union with God.&rdquo; In consequence of this, His Majesty
gave strict orders to all who were in attendance on me that no one
should teach me anything in prose or verse. At length <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb71" href="#v2pb71" name=
"v2pb71">71</a>]</span>when two years and seven months had passed away,
it happened one day that one of the privileged<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e11219src" href="#xd24e11219" name="xd24e11219src">177</a> women
was in the palace. She used to burn rue constantly in order to avert
the evil eye, and on this pretext had access to me. She used to partake
of the alms and charities. She found me alone and regardless of (or
ignorant of) what had been said (by Akbar), she taught me this
couplet:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;O God, open the rosebud of hope</p>
<p class="line">Display a flower from the everlasting
garden.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11229src" href="#xd24e11229"
name="xd24e11229src">178</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par first">I went to the S&#863;haik&#863;h and repeated this
couplet. He involuntarily rose up and hastened to wait on the King, and
informed him of what had occurred. In accordance with Fate, the same
night the traces of fever appeared, and the next day he sent someone to
the King (with the request) to call T&#257;n Sen Kal&#257;want, who was
unequalled as a singer. T&#257;n Sen, having gone to wait upon him,
began to sing. After this he sent some one to call the King. When H.M.
came, he said: &ldquo;The promised time of union has come, and I must
take leave of you.&rdquo; Taking his turban from his head, he placed it
on mine, and said: &ldquo;We have made Sul&#7789;&#257;n Sal&#299;m our
successor, and have made him over to God, the protector and
preserver.&rdquo; Gradually his weakness increased, and the signs of
passing<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11233src" href="#xd24e11233" name=
"xd24e11233src">179</a> away became more evident, till he attained
union with the &ldquo;True Beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">One of the greatest monuments of my father&rsquo;s reign
is this mosque and cemetery (<i>rauz&#803;a</i>). Certainly they are
exceedingly lofty and solid buildings. There is nothing like this
mosque in any other country. It is all built of beautiful stone, and
five lakhs of rupees were expended from the public treasury upon it.
Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K. Kokalt&#257;s&#863;h made the marble railing
(<i>mah&#803;jar</i>) round<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11245src" href=
"#xd24e11245" name="xd24e11245src">180</a> the cemetery, the flooring
(<i>fars&#863;h</i>) of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb72" href=
"#v2pb72" name="v2pb72">72</a>]</span>dome and portico, and these are
not included in the five lakhs. The mosque has two great gateways. The
one<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11257src" href="#xd24e11257" name=
"xd24e11257src">181</a> towards the south is extremely lofty, and is
very beautiful. The archway (<i>p&#299;s&#863;ht&#257;q</i>) is 12
yards broad, 16 long, and 52 high. One must mount thirty-two steps to
get to the top of it. The other gateway is smaller, and is towards the
east. The length of the mosque from east to west, including the width
of the walls, is 212 yards. Out of this, the <i>Maq&#7779;&#363;ra</i>
(the chancel) is 25&frac12; yards, the middle is 15 yards by 15, the
portico (<i>p&#299;s&#863;ht&#257;q</i>) is 7 yards broad, 14 yards
long, and 25 yards high. On each side of the large dome are two smaller
domes 10 yards by 10. Then there is a veranda (<i>aiw&#257;n</i>) which
is pillared. The breadth of the mosque from north to south is 172
yards. Round it are ninety verandas (<i>aiw&#257;n</i>) and eighty-four
cells. The breadth of each cell is 4 yards,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e11276src" href="#xd24e11276" name="xd24e11276src">182</a> and the
length 5 yards. The verandas are 7&frac12; yards broad. The courtyard
(<i>&#7779;ah&#803;n</i>) of the mosque, exclusive of the
<i>maq&#7779;&#363;ra</i>, and the verandas, and the gates, is 169
yards long and 143 yards broad. Above the verandas, the gates, and the
mosque, small domes have been constructed, and on the eves of
anniversaries and on holy days lamps are placed in these, and they are
enveloped in coloured<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11285src" href=
"#xd24e11285" name="xd24e11285src">183</a> cloths, so that they look
like lamp-shades (?). Under the courtyard they have made a well, and
they fill this with rainwater. As Fath&#803;p&#363;r has little water,
and what there is is bad, this well<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e11294src" href="#xd24e11294" name="xd24e11294src">184</a> yields
a sufficient supply for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb73" href=
"#v2pb73" name="v2pb73">73</a>]</span>whole year for the members of the
family (of Sal&#299;m Chis&#863;ht&#299;) and for the dervishes who are
the <i>muj&#257;wirs</i> (caretakers) of the mosque. Opposite the great
entrance and towards the north-north-east is the tomb of the
S&#863;haik&#863;h. The middle dome is 7 yards, and round the dome is a
portico of marble, and on the front side of this is a marble lattice.
It is very beautiful. Opposite this tomb on the west, at a little
distance, is another dome, in which are laid to rest the sons-in-law
and sons of the S&#863;haik&#863;h, such as Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K.,
Isl&#257;m K., Mu&#703;az&#804;z&#804;am K.,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e11306src" href="#xd24e11306" name="xd24e11306src">185</a> and
others, who were all connected with this family, and rose to the
position of Amirs and to lofty rank. Accordingly, the circumstances of
each have been recorded in their places. At present the son of
Isl&#257;m K., who is distinguished by the title of Ikr&#257;m K., is
the lord of the prayer-carpet. The signs of auspiciousness are manifest
in him; I am much inclined to cherish him.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 19th, I promoted
&#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K. to the mansab of 2,000 personal and
1,000 horse, and nominated him to the duty of taking the fort of
K&#257;ng&#7771;a, and the overthrow of the ungrateful S&#363;raj Mal.
I bestowed on him an elephant, a horse, and a dress of honour.
Turs&#363;n Bah&#257;dur was also dispatched on this duty, and his
mansab was fixed at 1,200 personal and 450 horse. He was given a horse,
and took his leave. As the house of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula was on
the bank of a tank, and people praised it greatly as a delightful place
and enchanting residence, at his request on Thursday, the 26th, an
entertainment was held there. That pillar of the kingdom engaged in the
dues of prostration and offerings, and prepared a grand meeting. At
night, after eating food, I returned to the palace. On Thursday, the
3rd of the Divine month of Isfand-armuz, Sayyid
&#703;Abdu-l-Wahh&#257;b B&#257;rha, who had done active service in
Gujarat, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse,
and was honoured with the title of Dil&#299;r K. On Saturday, the 12th,
I went out to Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d for sport, and until Sunday, with
the ladies, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb74" href="#v2pb74" name=
"v2pb74">74</a>]</span>employed myself in the pleasure of hunting. On
the eve of Thursday, the 27th<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11313src"
href="#xd24e11313" name="xd24e11313src">186</a> (17th), I returned to
the palace.</p>
<p class="par">By chance, on Tuesday, during the hunting, a string of
pearls and rubies that N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam had on her neck was
broken, and a ruby of the value of Rs. 10,000 and a pearl worth Rs.
1,000 were lost. Although the huntsmen made every search for it on
Wednesday, it did not fall into their hands. It occurred to me that as
the name of the day was <i>Kam-s&#863;hamba</i>, it was impossible to
find it on that day. On the contrary, as
<i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i> (Thursday) was always a lucky day for
me, and had been blessed to me, the huntsmen on that day with but a
little search found both in that track-less place (without head or
foundation) and brought them to me. The best of coincidences was that
on the same propitious day the entertainment for my lunar weighing and
the feast of Basant-b&#257;r&#299; (Spring festival) also took place,
and the good news of the conquest of the fort of Mau and the defeat of
that evil-fortuned S&#363;raj Mal arrived.</p>
<p class="par">The particulars of this are that when R&#257;ja
Bikram&#257;j&#299;t with the victorious army arrived in that region,
the ill-fated S&#363;raj Mal desired to delay him for some days by
trickery and babblement, but the aforesaid knew the real state of the
case and did not pay attention to his words, but advanced with the foot
of valour. That abandoned one, letting fall from his hand the thread of
plan, neither planted the foot of intrepidity firmly for battle nor had
the courage to defend the fort. After a slight struggle, and when many
of his people had been slaughtered, he took to flight, and the forts of
Mau<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11326src" href="#xd24e11326" name=
"xd24e11326src">187</a> and Mahr&#299; (?), which were the chief
reliance of that ill-fated man, were both taken without difficulty. A
country <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb75" href="#v2pb75" name=
"v2pb75">75</a>]</span>which he had held by hereditary right from his
fathers was trodden under foot by the victorious troops, and he became
a wanderer and a vagabond. He retired to the ravines of the hills, and
cast the dust of ruin and contempt on the head of his Fortune.
R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, leaving his country behind, hastened in
pursuit of him with the victorious army. When the state of affairs
reached the royal ears, in reward for this becoming service I ordered
drums for the Raja, and a fateful farman was issued from the Sovereign
of Wrath that they should overthrow from their foundation the fort and
buildings that had been erected by S&#363;raj Mal&rsquo;s father and
himself, and leave not a trace of them on the face of the earth. A
strange thing is that the unfortunate S&#363;raj Mal had a brother
called Jagat Singh. When I promoted S&#363;raj Mal to the title of
Raja, and made him an Amir, and gave him dominion, etc., without a
partner or sharer, I, in order to please him, gave a small mansab to
Jagat Singh, who did not get on well with him, and sent him to Bengal.
This wretched one was passing his days in a poor condition far from his
home, in contempt, and to the delight of his enemies, and waiting for
some hidden aid, until by his good fortune this affair took place, and
that unblessed one struck an axe on his own foot. Summoning Jagat Singh
in all haste to Court, I honoured him with the title of Raja and the
mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and bestowed 20,000
<i>darbs</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e11339src" href="#xd24e11339"
name="xd24e11339src">188</a> on him out of the public treasury for his
expenses. Giving him a jewelled khapwa, a robe of honour, a horse, and
an elephant, I sent him to R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, and issued a
farman that if the aforesaid, by the guidance of a good destiny, should
perform laudable service, and display loyalty, that country should be
given over into his hand.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11345src" href=
"#xd24e11345" name="xd24e11345src">189</a></p>
<p class="par">As the praise of the garden of N&#363;r-manzil and the
buildings that had been newly-erected there continually reached me, I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb76" href="#v2pb76" name=
"v2pb76">76</a>]</span>on Monday mounted my steed, and went to the
stage of Bust&#257;n-sar&#257;y, and passed Tuesday in pleasure and at
ease in that entrancing rose-garden. On the eve of Wednesday the garden
of N&#363;r-manzil (the abode of light) was adorned by the alighting of
the hosts of prosperity. This garden contains 330 <i>jar&#299;bs</i>
(<i>b&#299;gh&#257;s</i>), according to the <i>Il&#257;h&#299; gaz</i>.
Around it there has been built a wall, lofty and broad, of bricks and
cement, exceedingly strong. In the garden there is a lofty building and
a residence, highly decorated. Pleasant reservoirs have been
constructed, and outside the gate a large well has been made, from
which thirty-two pairs of bullocks continually draw water. The canal
passes through the garden, and pours water into the reservoirs. Besides
this, there are other wells, the water of which is distributed to the
reservoirs and plots. The beauty is increased by all kinds of fountains
and cascades and there is a tank in the exact middle of the garden
which is filled by rainwater. If by chance its water should fail in the
extreme heat, they supplement it by water from the wells, so that it
may always be full to the brim. Nearly Rs. 150,000 have been spent up
to now on this garden, and it is still unfinished, and large sums will
be expended in making avenues and laying down plants. It has also been
settled that the middle garden shall be newly walled<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e11361src" href="#xd24e11361" name="xd24e11361src">190</a>
round, and the channels for the coming and going of the water shall be
made so strong that it may always remain full of water and the water
shall not leak out in any way, and no damage accrue. It is possible
that before it is complete nearly Rs. 200,000 will have been spent on
it.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 24th, Khw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n presented
an offering of jewels, jewelled vessels, cloths, an elephant, and a
horse, of the value of Rs. 150,000. Having made a selection from them,
I gave him the remainder. Until Saturday I passed my time in that
garden of delight in enjoyment. On the eve of Sunday, the 27th, I
inclined the reins of returning towards <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb77" href="#v2pb77" name="v2pb77">77</a>]</span>Fath&#803;p&#363;r,
and an order was given that the great Amirs, according to annual
custom, should decorate the palace. On Monday, the 28th, I found that
something had gone wrong with my eye. As it arose from too much blood,
I ordered &#703;Al&#299; Akbar, the surgeon, to open a vein. On the
next day the benefit of this was apparent. I bestowed Rs. 1,000 on him.
On Tuesday, the 29th, Muqarrab K. came from his native place, and had
the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and I favoured him with many
sorts of kindness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb78" href="#v2pb78"

mentioning the position of the letters, but the I.O. MS. No. 181, has
<i>dar zabar</i> (&ldquo;above&rdquo; or &ldquo;on it.&rdquo;). The
words <i>kha&#7789;&#7789;-i-muh&#803;arraf</i> might mean
&ldquo;inverted or slanting letters,&rdquo; and Mr. Rogers has taken
the passage to mean that two of the letters were on a line with one
another, and that the third was inverted and below the other two. But
<i>muh&#803;rif</i>, as the word may also be read, has the meaning of
&ldquo;handsome,&rdquo; and I think this is the meaning here. Possibly
the meaning is that there was a letter or mark <i>above</i>&mdash;viz.,
the <i>tas&#863;hd&#299;d</i>. Another meaning may be that all three
letters were equal in size, and in a slanting position on the

Sayyid Muh&#803;ammad, the M&#299;r referred to by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r,
lived into S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s reign, not dying till
1045 (1635&ndash;36). See P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h-n&#257;ma, I., Part
II., p. 329. But we do not hear anything more of his translation.
Perhaps his ill-health prevented him. It is also the fact that orthodox
Muh&#803;ammadans object to translations of the Qoran, regarding it as
an impossible task. The M&#299;r&rsquo;s son became chief
ecclesiastical officer (&#7778;adr) under S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n.

This must be the Barmadh Mata mentioned by Beale (see Proceedings
A.S.B. for August, 1873, p. 159). Beale says there is a place of
worship of the Hindus about 1&frac12; koss from Biana in the district
of Bhartpur called Barmadh Mata. In the 7th year of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r,
1022, 1613, Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s mother Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;
made a garden and a <i>b&#257;&#702;ol&#299;</i> (step-well) here at a

Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, 117. He arrived at the environs of
Fath&#803;p&#363;r on 19 Dai, or about 22 Muh&#803;arram, 1028 (end of
December, 1618). Apparently he considered that he arrived at
Fath&#803;p&#363;r on 20 Dai. He remained on the outskirts and did not
enter the town till the 28th (apparently should be 26th or 27th). The
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma 122 makes Jah&#257;ng&#299;r arrive at the
outskirts of Fath&#803;p&#363;r on 20 Dai, and it gives the date of his
entering the town as 26 Dai or 1 &#7778;afar, 1028 (January 8, 1619).

Jah&#257;ng&#299;r says four <i>g&#863;ha&#7771;&#299;</i> are nearly
equal to two sidereal hours. According to Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l, a
<i>g&#863;ha&#7771;&#299;</i> is the sixteenth part of a nychthemeron,
or 360 out of the 21,600 breathings which make up a
nychthemeron&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, 24 hours. See Jarrett, III. 16 and 17,
and II. 16, n. 4. According to the Bah&#257;r-i-&#703;ajam, 2&frac12;
<i>g&#863;ha&#7771;&#299;</i> = one sidereal hour, so that, correctly
speaking, five <i>g&#863;ha&#7771;&#299;</i> = two sidereal hours. Each
<i>g&#863;ha&#7771;&#299;</i> is 24 minutes (Jarrett, II. 16, n. 4).
Here it should be noted that there is a mistake in the translation at
p. 17, line 2, of Jarrett, vol. III., due to a faulty reading in the
Bib. Ind. edition of the text. Instead of <i>yak&#299;</i> we should
read <i>pal&#299;</i>, as in two MSS. in my possession.
Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l&rsquo;s meaning then becomes clear. What he says
is, a <i>g&#863;ha&#7771;&#299;</i> is 360 breathings, consequently
(<i>pas</i>) every <i>pal</i> (already defined as the sixtieth part of
a <i>g&#863;ha&#7771;&#299;</i>) is 360 divided by 60, and equal to six
breathings (<i>nafas</i>). Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s line, however, is
obscure. In two I.O. MSS. we have <i>ba-t&#804;&#257;la&#703;&#299;</i>
instead of <i>ba-s&#257;&#703;at&#299;</i>. I think the meaning
probably is that the same day which marked Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s
arrival at Fath&#803;p&#363;r also marked Sh&#257;h-Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s
birthday.</p>
<p class="par footnote cont"><i>Tawall&#257;</i> is defined in the
Bah&#257;r-i-&#703;ajam as meaning to have friendship with anyone. It
also says that it is used in the sense of
<i>taqarrub</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, nearness. It may be therefore that
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s line means &ldquo;At a moment which nearly
corresponded to two (hours).&rdquo; <i>Taqw&#299;m</i> would then mean
established or fixed, and not a calendar. <i>Taqw&#299;m kardan</i> is
a phrase which means &ldquo;to adjust, to

Text <i>dar&#703;a</i>, MSS. <i>z&#817;ir&#257;&#703;</i>. See text
298, account of fifteenth year, where a <i>dar&#703;a</i> is defined.
The <i>Il&#257;h&#299; gaz</i> or <i>dara&#703;</i> consisted of 40
digits (fingerbreadths), according to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r. If the
Kap&#363;r tank be the one described in the Arch&aelig;ological Survey
Reports, Vol. XVIII., for 1894, yards seem to be required here, for the
tank is mentioned in the Report as being 95 feet 7 inches square.
According to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, 34 krors odd of
dams&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, I presume, <i>ful&#363;s</i>, in copper money,
and 16 lakhs and 80,000 rupees in silver were poured into the tank,
making a total of 1 kror and 3 lakhs of rupees, or 3 lakhs 43,000
<i>t&#363;m&#257;ns</i>. Apparently the <i>t&#363;m&#257;n</i>, which
was a gold coin, was, in Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s time, reckoned as
worth 30 rupees, and Wollaston, in his Dictionary, says it was worth
&pound;3 in S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s I.&rsquo;s time.
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s account of the tank should be compared with
that given in the Akbar-n&#257;ma, III. 246 and 257, where the tank is
called the An&#363;p-tal&#257;o, or the &ldquo;Unequalled
Tank.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par footnote cont">In the text, difficulty has, I think, been
made by the introduction of the word <i>kih</i> in p. 260, six lines
from foot, and <i>b&#257;s&#863;had</i> in the fifth line from the
foot. These words make the sense to be that 34 krors odd of dams were
only equal to 16 <span class="corr" id="xd24e11139" title=
"Source: lahks">lakhs</span> odd of rupees. But this cannot be, for the
dam was the fortieth part of a rupee, and so 34 krors of dams would be
not far short of one kror&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, 100 lakhs of rupees. The
MSS. have not the <i>kih</i> and <i>b&#257;s&#863;had</i> in question,
and have only a conjunction after the word <i>d&#257;m</i>. Thirty-four
krors odd of copper and 16 lakhs of silver were poured into the tank,
making a total, in round numbers, of 1 kror, 3 lakhs of rupees.

<i>t&#257;nks</i>, and very delicate, valued at Rs. 40,000. Further,
six pearls, one of them 1 <i>t&#257;nk</i> and 8 <i>surk&#863;hs</i> in
weight. The Vakils of my son had bought it in Gujarat for Rs. 25,000,
and the five others for Rs. 33,000. Also one diamond, the price of
which was Rs. 18,000. Also a jewelled <i>parda</i> (sash), a sword-hilt
made in his own goldsmith&rsquo;s shop; most of the jewels he had
himself set and cut. He had brought great dexterity to bear on the
design. Its value was fixed as Rs. 50,000. The designs<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e11422src" href="#xd24e11422" name=
"xd24e11422src">2</a> were his own; no one else had up to this day
thought <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb79" href="#v2pb79" name=

workmanship. There was also a pair of drums made of gold for playing
the <i>mursal</i> (overture?) with a whole orchestra&mdash;viz.,
<i>kuwarga</i>, <i>naqq&#257;ra</i>, <i>karan&#257;</i>,
<i>surn&#257;</i>, etc.&mdash;whatever was required for the
<i>naqq&#257;ra-kh&#257;na</i> (music-hall) of great princes, and all
made of silver. At the auspicious hour at which I had seated myself on
the throne of success these were all sounded. The whole of them came to
a value of Rs. 65,000. Another was a seat for riding an elephant,
called by moderns a howdah (<i>hauda</i>), made of gold, worth Rs.
30,000. Beside this there were two large elephants and five
elephant-trappings of the offerings of Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk, ruler of
Golconda. The first elephant was named D&#257;d-i-Il&#257;h&#299; (the
gift of God). As it entered the private elephant-house on New
Year&rsquo;s Day, I gave it the name of <i>N&#363;r-i-Naur&#363;z</i>
(the Light of New Year&rsquo;s Day). In truth he is a grand elephant,
and lacks nothing of size, beauty, and dignity. As he looked well to my
eye, I mounted him and rode him into the courtyard of the palace. His
value was fixed at Rs. 80,000, and the value of six<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e11479src" href="#xd24e11479" name="xd24e11479src">3</a> others
at Rs. 20,000. Its golden trappings, consisting of golden chains, etc.,
my son had had made for the elephant N&#363;r-i-Naur&#363;z, were worth
Rs. 30,000. The second elephant, with silver housings, was also
presented, with Rs. 10,000 more in various choice jewels. The
<i>kurkar&#257;qs</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e11485src" href=
"#xd24e11485" name="xd24e11485src">4</a> of my son had also prepared
and sent delicate cloths from Gujarat. If all details were to be
written, it would take too long. Briefly, the whole of his offerings
was of the value of Rs. 450,000. It is hoped that he will eat the fruit
of long life and prosperity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb80"

<p class="par">On Friday, the 2nd, S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K.
&#703;Arab, and N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299;, the kotwal, laid their
offerings before me. On Saturday, the 3rd, D&#257;r&#257;b K., son of
the K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, and on Sunday, the 4th,
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, prayed to be allowed to entertain me. Out
of the latter&rsquo;s offerings I accepted one pearl, bought for Rs.
20,000, with other rareties, altogether of the value of Rs. 130,000,
and presented him with the rest. On Monday, the 5th, R&#257;ja
Kis&#863;han D&#257;s and H&#803;&#257;kim K., on Tuesday, the 6th,
Sard&#257;r K., and on Wednesday, the 7th, Mu&#7779;t&#804;af&#257; K.
and Am&#257;nat K., presented their offerings. From each of these I
took a trifle in order to dignify them. On Thursday, the 8th,
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula, <i>Mad&#257;r-ul-mulk</i> (the pivot of the
country), having prepared a royal entertainment, begged to be allowed
to receive me. In accepting this request his standing was raised. In
fact, in decorating the assembly and the largeness of his offering, he
had exceeded himself, and made many decorations, and illuminated all
sides of the lake as far as the eye could reach, and decorated the
streets both near and far with all kinds of lights and coloured
lanterns. Among the offerings of that <i>Mad&#257;r-us-saltana</i>
there was a throne of gold and silver, much ornamented and decorated,
the supports of which were in the form of tigers. It had been completed
with great assiduity in the space of three years, and was made at the
cost of Rs. 450,000. This throne had been made by a skilful European of
the name of Hunarmand (skilful), who had no rival in the arts of a
goldsmith and a jeweller, and in all sorts of skill
(<i>hunarmand&#299;</i>). He had made it very well, and I gave him this
name. In addition to the offerings he had brought for me, he offered
the value of Rs. 100,000 in jewelled ornaments and cloths to the Begams
and other ladies of the Palace. Without exaggeration, from the
beginning of the reign of the late king (may the light of Allah be his
testimony!) until now, which is the fourteenth year of the rule of this
suppliant, not one of the great Amirs has presented such offerings. In
fact, what comparison is there between him and others?</p>
<p class="par">On this day Ikr&#257;m K., s. Isl&#257;m K. was honoured
with the mansab, original and increased, of 2,000 personal and 1,000

Singh-dalan with that of 2,000 personal and 1,600 horse, original and
increased. On Friday, the 9th, I&#703;tib&#257;r K. presented his
offering, and on the same day K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n, having been
presented with a horse and an elephant, took leave to go to the
government of Patna.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11515src" href=

Singh-dalan, and on Wednesday, the 14th, M&#299;rz&#257; R&#257;j&#257;
Bh&#257;o Singh, presented their offerings. Selecting from them what
was delicate and new, I gave the remainder to them. On Thursday, the
15th, &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n prepared a grand assembly and a
royal entertainment in his own house, which is a very fine and pleasant
place, and begged to be allowed to receive me. At his request, giving
him the dignity of acceptance, I went there with the ladies. That
pillar of the kingdom looked on this as a bounty from the secret Giver,
and in the increase of his offering and preparation of the
entertainment displayed great magnificence. Of jewels of great price
and delicate gold brocades and all sorts of gifts, that which was
approved was selected, and I presented him with the remainder. Among
the offerings was a ruby weighing 12&frac12; <i>t&#257;nks</i>, which
was bought for Rs. 125,000. The value of the offerings that were
accepted was Rs. 167,000. On this day K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n was
raised to the mansab of 5,000 personal and 2,500 horse.</p>
<p class="par">Las&#863;hkar K., having come, by order, from the
Deccan, had the honour of waiting on me. As I had determined, after the
rainy season had passed and in the beginning of the good weather, to go
to the perpetual spring garden of Kashm&#299;r under the favour of
Almighty God, it seemed right to me that the guardianship and
administration of the fort and city of Agra and the faujd&#257;rship of
the district, after the manner in which they had been held by
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, should be entrusted to Las&#863;hkar K.,
and I honoured him with the good news. Am&#257;nat K. was entrusted
with the duty of superintendent of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

culmination, &#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daula K., presented offerings, and I
accepted from each of them, by way of exalting their dignity, what I
approved. At this New Year the value of the accepted offerings of the
servants of the Court came to Rs. 2,000,000. On the day of culmination
I conferred on my auspicious son Sul&#7789;&#257;n Parw&#299;z<a class=

original and increased. I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula was promoted to that
of 7,000 personal and horse. I selected &#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daula for
the duty of tutor to the pupil of the eye of the Sultanate,
S&#863;h&#257;h S&#863;huj&#257;&#703;. I hope that he (the latter) may
endure for his natural term of life and may be one of the prosperous
ones. Q&#257;sim K. was raised to the mansab of 1,500 personal and 500
horse, and B&#257;qir K. to that of 1,000 personal and 400 horse. As
Mah&#257;bat K. had asked for reinforcements, I appointed 500
<i>Ah&#803;ad&#299;</i> horse to Bangash, and presented &#703;Izzat K.,
who had done approved service in that province, with a horse and a
jewelled <i>khapwa</i>. At this time &#703;Abdu-s-Satt&#257;r<a class=

handwriting of the late king Hum&#257;y&#363;n (may the lights of Allah
be his testimony!), containing some prayers, an introduction to the
science of astronomy, and other marvellous things, most of which he had
studied and carried into practice. After reverently inspecting his
auspicious handwriting, I felt a joy such as I had seldom experienced.
I was exceedingly rejoiced, for, by God, no precious thing I have can
be compared with this. In return I increased his mansab beyond what he
had imagined possible, and gave him a present of Rs. 1,000. Hunarmand,
the European who had made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb83" href=

with 3,000 <i>darb</i>, a horse and an elephant. I gave Rs. 1,000 to
K&#863;hw&#257;ja K&#863;h&#257;wand Mah&#803;m&#363;d, who is a
pilgrim of the Path of the K&#863;hw&#257;jas, and is not void of
dervishism and spirituality. Las&#863;hkar K. was promoted to the
mansab of 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, Ma&#703;m&#363;r K. to that

<p class="par">On Wednesday, the 21st, I went to
Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d for the purpose of sport. Some days before
this, in accordance with orders, K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, and
Qiy&#257;m K., the head huntsman, had chosen a wide plain for a
<i>qamarg&#863;ha</i> hunt, and drawn an enclosure round it, and driven
within it many antelope from the neighbouring plains. As I had vowed
that I would hereafter not kill any living thing with my own hand, it
occurred to me to take them all alive, and place them within the
Chaug&#257;n (polo-ground) of Fath&#803;p&#363;r, so that I might both
enjoy the pleasure of sport and that at the same time no harm should
happen to them. I accordingly took 700 head and sent them to
Fath&#803;p&#363;r. As the hour for entering the capital was near, I
ordered R&#257;y M&#257;n, <i>k&#863;hidmatiyya</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e11580src" href="#xd24e11580" name="xd24e11580src">10</a> to
put up a screen on two sides, like a lane, from the hunting-place
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb84" href="#v2pb84" name=

the antelope there. About 800 antelope were sent in this way, or
altogether 1,500. On the night of Wednesday, the 28th, marching from
Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d, I halted in B&#363;st&#257;n Sar&#257;y, and
on the eve of Thursday, the 29th, I halted at the N&#363;r-manzil
garden.</p>
<p class="par">On Friday, the 30th, the mother<a class="noteref" id=

S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n attained the mercy of God. The next day I
myself went to the house of that precious son, and having condoled with
him in every way, took him with me to the palace. On Sunday, the 1st
Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, at the auspicious hour chosen by the
astrologers and astronomers, I mounted a special elephant of the name
of Dil&#299;r, and in all prosperity and happiness entered the city. A
great crowd of people, men and women, had collected together in the
streets and bazaars, and at the gates and walls, expecting me.
According to custom, I went on, scattering money on the way, to inside
the palace. From the date on which the army of prosperity started for
this happily terminated journey until now, when I returned in happiness
and good fortune, it was five years, seven months, and nine days. At
this time I ordered my son Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z that, as a
long time had passed during which he had been deprived of waiting on me
personally, or had been fortunate enough to pay his respects, if he
were desirous of meeting me, he should come to Court. On the arrival of
the gracious farm&#257;n, that son, considering the manifestation of
this favour a gift from the hidden world, turned the face of his hope
towards the sphere-resembling Court. At this time I gave away, as a
means of livelihood, to Faqirs and deserving people 44,786 bighas of
land, and two entire villages, with 320 ass-loads
(<i>k&#863;harw&#257;r</i>, a weight) of grain from Kashmir, and seven
ploughs<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11596src" href="#xd24e11596" name=

Bestower of desires and benevolence may be their daily lot.

<p class="par">One of the occurrences of this time is the revolt of
All&#257;hd&#257;d, son of Jal&#257;l, the Afghan. The details of this
are that when Mah&#257;bat K. obtained leave to go and take possession
of Bangash and overthrow the Afghans, from an idea that that wretch
would do some service in return for the favours and kindness I had
conferred on him, he prayed that he might take him with him. As the
natural tendency of such ungrateful men who do not recognize what is
right, tends to enmity and malevolence, by way of precaution it was
decided to send his son and brother to the Court that they might be as
hostages. After the arrival there of his son and brother, I, by way of
comforting them, did them all kinds of kindness, but, as they have
said:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The blanket of fortune of anyone that has been
woven black</p>
<p class="line">Cannot be whitened even by the waters of Zamzam and
Kaus&#804;ar.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">From the day on which he arrived in that country
the signs of rascality and want of recognition of the right began to be
apparent on the cheeks of his affairs, and Mah&#257;bat K., in order to
control matters, did not loose from his hand the rope of forbearance
until, at this time, he sent a force under the leadership of his son
against a band of Afghans, and sent All&#257;hd&#257;d with him. When
they reached the purposed place, from the enmity and malevolence of the
aforesaid, that attack did not <span class="corr" id="xd24e11611"
title="Source: succceed">succeed</span>, and they returned with their
aim uncompleted. The evil-dispositioned All&#257;hd&#257;d, from a
suspicion lest this time Mah&#257;bat K. should abandon his method of
conciliation, and ascertain the real state of affairs, and that he
should be caught in recompense for his evil deeds, lifted up the veil
of reverence, and betrayed involuntarily the faithlessness to his salt,
which he had till then concealed. When I heard from Mah&#257;bat
K.&rsquo;s letter the true state of affairs, I ordered them to imprison
his son and brother in the fort of Gwalior. As it had happened
(Jal&#257;l T&#257;r&#299;k&#299;), the father of this wretch had also
fled from the service of the late king, and for years passed his time
in thieving and highway robbery, until he was caught in the recompense
of his own evil deeds. It is hoped that this rascal will also soon
obtain the reward of his bad actions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

and drank immoderately, if there was truth in this it was a pity that
he should destroy himself at his age. It was necessary that he should
not leave him to his own way, but look after his case properly. If he
could not leave his charge himself, he should write a clear report, so
that, having summoned him into my presence, I might give the best order
practicable under the circumstances. When he arrived at Burhanpur,
having found S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n very weak and
low, he tried to make some remedy for him. After some days&rsquo;
confinement to bed (literally, lord of the carpet) he fell on the couch
of powerlessness. Whatever remedies and plans the physicians employed
were of no avail, and in the best time of his youth and prosperity, in
the thirty-third year of his age, to the sorrow and grief of the world,
he went to the place of the mercy and pardon of God. On hearing this
unpleasant news I was greatly grieved, for in truth he was an
intelligent youth and born in the house. He would have performed
important services in this State, and left great traces behind him.
Although this road is before all and there is no escape for anyone out
of the command of destiny, yet it appears sad to depart in this
fashion. It is hoped he will be among those who are pardoned. I sent
R&#257;ja S&#257;rang Deo, who was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb88" href="#v2pb88" name="v2pb88">88</a>]</span>one of my close
attendants and is a tactful person, to the &#256;t&#257;l&#299;q, and
favoured and consoled him in every way. The mansab of 5,000 held by
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z I added on to those of his brothers and
sons. To D&#257;r&#257;b, his younger brother, I gave the mansab of
5,000 personal, original and increased, and presented him with a dress
of honour, an elephant, a horse, and a jewelled sword, and gave him
leave to go to his father to fill, in place of
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z, the post of governor of Berar and
Ahmadnagar. Rah&#803;m&#257;n-d&#257;d, another brother, I promoted to
the mansab of 2,000 and 800 horse. Man&#363;chahr, s.
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z, was given the mansab of 2,000 personal and
1,000 horse. T&#804;ag&#863;hzal (Tog&#863;hril?), s.
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11648src" href=
"#xd24e11648" name="xd24e11648src">17</a> K. was promoted to the mansab
of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. On Thursday, the 12th, Q&#257;sim K.,
son-in-law of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula, was honoured with the favour
of a standard. Asadu-llah, s. Sayyid H&#803;&#257;j&#299;, who had come
with the intention of obtaining service, had the mansab bestowed on him
of 500 personal and 100 horse. &#7778;adr Jah&#257;n, son-in-law of the
deceased Murtaz&#803;&#257; K., received that of 700 personal and 600
horse, and was appointed to the faujd&#257;rship of Sambhal, and,
having had an elephant bestowed on him, I gave him leave. Bh&#257;rat
Band&#299;la was also presented with the mansab of 600 personal and 400
horse, and had an elephant given him, and an elephant was bestowed on
Sangr&#257;m, the Raja of Jammu.</p>
<p class="par">In Ahmadabad I had two male
<i>m&#257;rk&#863;h&#363;r</i> goats. As I had not a female in my
establishment to pair with them, it occurred to me that if I could pair
them with Barbary goats, which they bring from Arabia, especially from
the port of the city of Darkhar,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11656src"
href="#xd24e11656" name="xd24e11656src">18</a> young of their form and
qualities might be obtained. In short, I paired them with seven Barbary
ewes, and after six months had elapsed each of the latter had a young
one at Fath&#803;p&#363;r: there were four females and three males,
very pleasing in appearance, of good shape and good colour. In their
colour, those (kids) which resembled the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb89" href="#v2pb89" name="v2pb89">89</a>]</span>male (<i>taka</i>,
not <i>baka</i>, as in the printed copy) were dun-coloured with black
stripes on their backs. Red,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11671src" href=
"#xd24e11671" name="xd24e11671src">19</a> indeed, appears to me a more
pleasing colour than any other, and it is the mark of a better breed.
Of their liveliness and laughable ways and their manner of gamboling
and leaping, what can be written? Some of their ways are such that the
mind derived uncontrolled pleasure from looking at them. It is
notorious that painters cannot draw properly the motions of a kid.
Granting that they may chance to draw the movements of an ordinary kid
after a fashion, they certainly would have to acknowledge themselves at
a loss how to draw the motions of these kids. When one month, or even
twenty days old, they would leap up upon high places and throw
themselves on to the ground in a way that if any other but a kid were
to do so, not one limb would be left whole. As it pleased me, I ordered
them always to be kept near me, and I gave each of them an appropriate
name. I am much delighted with them, and pay great attention to
bringing together m&#257;rk&#863;h&#363;r males and well-bred
she-goats. I desire to have many young ones from them, and that they
may become well known among men. After their young shall have paired,
most probably more delicate ones will be obtained. One of their
peculiarities is that ordinary kids immediately they are born, and
until they begin to suck, make a great bleating, whilst these, on the
contrary, make no sound, and stand quite contented and without wailing.
Perhaps their flesh would be very pleasant to the taste.</p>
<p class="par">Before this, an order had been given that Muqarrab K.,
having been appointed to Bihar, should hasten off there. He came to
Court in order to pay his respects before he repaired to his
destination, and accordingly, on Thursday, the 2nd
K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d, an elephant with trappings, two horses, and a
jewelled <i>khapwa</i> were conferred on him, and he took leave. Rs.
50,000 were given him as an advance of pay. On the same day Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n received a dress of honour, an elephant, and a horse,
and obtained the Sarkar of Monghyr, which is in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb90" href="#v2pb90" name=
"v2pb90">90</a>]</span>the province of Bihar and Bengal, and took
leave. M&#299;r S&#863;har&#299;f,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11684src"
href="#xd24e11684" name="xd24e11684src">20</a> the Vak&#299;l of
Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk, who was at Court, took leave. My fortunate son,
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, sent with him the brother of Afz&#803;al
K., his Diwan. As Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk had shown attachment and desire to
please, and repeatedly importuned me for a portrait, I presented him,
at his request, with my likeness, a jewelled <i>khapwa</i>, and a
<i>ph&#363;l ka&#7789;&#257;ra</i>. 24,000 <i>darb</i>, a jewelled
dagger, a horse, and a dress of honour were also given to the aforesaid
M&#299;r S&#863;har&#299;f. F&#257;z&#803;il K., director of buildings,
was advanced to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and
H&#803;ak&#299;m R&#257;gho N&#257;th to that of 600 personal and 60
horse. As at this time the anniversary of the late king (Akbar)
occurred, Rs. 5,000 were handed over to some of my chief servants to
divide among poor and deserving people. H&#803;asan &#703;Al&#299; K.,
jagirdar of the Sarkar of Monghyr, was honoured with the mansab of
2,500 personal and horse, and sent to the assistance of
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K. Fath&#803;-jang, governor of the province of
Bengal, and he was presented with a sword. As M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;harafu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain K&#257;s&#863;hg&#863;har&#299;
sacrificed his life on duty in Bangash, I promoted his son
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500
horse. At this time Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K. constructed two
boats,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11697src" href="#xd24e11697" name=
"xd24e11697src">21</a> which in the language of the country they call
<i>Kos&#863;ha</i>, one of gold and the other of silver, and sent them
to me by way of offering. Undoubtedly, of their own kind they are the
finest. One of these I gave to my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n. On
Thursday, the 9th, S&#257;d&#257;t K. was granted the mansab of 1,000
personal and 60 horse. On this day &#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daula and
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K. &#703;Arab took leave for their jagirs. On
this Thursday I presented &#256;&#7779;af K. with a jewelled
<i>khapwa</i> and a <i>ph&#363;l kat&#257;ra</i>. As my fortunate son
Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z proposed to come to Court, he asked for a
special <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> dress of honour, a <i>ch&#299;ra</i>,
and a <i>fota</i>, so that he might wear them and be distinguished on
the day of meeting me and of having the good fortune to pay his
respects. According to his request, I sent by the hand of his Vakil,
S&#863;har&#299;f, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb91" href="#v2pb91"
name="v2pb91">91</a>]</span>a sumptuous dress of honour with a
<i>ch&#299;ra</i> and a special sash. On Thursday, the 23rd,
M&#299;rz&#257; W&#257;l&#299;, son of the aunt of this suppliant, came
by order from the Deccan, and had the good fortune to kiss the
threshold. His father, K&#863;hw&#257;ja H&#803;asan
K&#863;h&#257;ld&#257;r (the freckled?), was one of the
Naqs&#863;hband&#299; K&#863;hw&#257;jas. My uncle, M&#299;rz&#257;
Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;ak&#299;m, gave his sister in marriage to the
K&#863;hw&#257;ja. I heard much praise of the K&#863;hw&#257;ja from
people: he had both good family and got on well with every one, and for
a long time the management of the affairs of my uncle M&#299;rz&#257;
Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;ak&#299;m had been in his hands, and he was on
very good terms with him. Before the M&#299;rz&#257;&rsquo;s death he
had himself delivered<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11729src" href=
"#xd24e11729" name="xd24e11729src">22</a> over the deposit of his life.
Two sons survived him&mdash;viz., M&#299;rz&#257;
Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n and M&#299;rz&#257; W&#257;l&#299;. M.
Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, after the death of the M&#299;rz&#257;,
ran away, and went to M&#257;-war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr (Transoxania),
and in that exile became a traveller on the road of non-existence. The
Begam and M&#299;rz&#257; W&#257;l&#299; came to the glorious Court,
and H.M. (Akbar) behaved very kindly to the Begam. The M&#299;rz&#257;
also is a steady and sedate young man, not devoid of reasonableness and
understanding. He is very skilled in the science of music. At this time
it occurred to me to marry the daughter of the deceased Prince
D&#257;niy&#257;l to the M&#299;rz&#257;, and my reason for sending for
the M&#299;rz&#257; to Court was this. This girl (Bul&#257;q&#299;
Begam) is the offspring of the daughter of Qil&#299;j Muh&#803;ammad K.
It is hoped that the grace of striving to please and to serve, which is
the means of good fortune and prosperity, may be his (M.
W&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s) lot and fortune.</p>
<p class="par">On this day Sarbuland R&#257;y, who had been sent on
duty to the Deccan, was promoted to the mansab of 2,500 personal and
1,500 horse.</p>
<p class="par">At this time it was reported to me that a
<i>Shayy&#257;d</i> (a loud talker, a cheat) of the name of
S&#863;haik&#863;h<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11739src" href=
"#xd24e11739" name="xd24e11739src">23</a> Ah&#803;mad had spread the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb92" href="#v2pb92" name=
"v2pb92">92</a>]</span>net of hypocrisy and deceit in Sirhind, and
caught in it many of the apparent worshippers without spirituality, and
had sent into every city and country one of his disciples, whom he
called his deputy (k&#863;hal&#299;fa), and whom he considered more
skilled than others in the adorning of shops (of deceit) and selling of
religious knowledge, and in deceiving men. He had also written a number
of idle tales to his disciples and his believers, and had made them
into a book which he called <i>Makt&#363;b&#257;t</i> (letters). In
that album (<i>Jung</i>) of absurdities many unprofitable things had
been written that drag (people) into infidelity and impiety. Amongst
these he had written in a letter as follows: &ldquo;In the course of my
travels I had come to the dwelling of the Two Lights (the Sun and
Moon), and saw a very lofty and very splendid building. From there I
passed to the abode of Discrimination (F&#257;r&#363;q), and from there
I passed to the abode of Truth (&#7778;idd&#299;q), and to each I wrote
a suitable explanation (or perhaps, of each I wrote a suitable
description). From there I reached the abode of Love, and I beheld a
brilliant dwelling. It had divers colours and lights and reflected
glories. That is to say (God forgive us!&mdash;an exclamation of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s), I passed from the abode of the Vicegerents
(k&#863;hulaf&#257;) and attained to the highest rank.&rdquo; There
were other presumptuous expressions which it would be too long to
write, and would be contrary to good manners. I <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e11756" title="Source: according">accordingly</span> gave an order
that they should bring him to the Court that is based on justice.
According to order he came to pay his respects. To all that I asked him
he could give no reasonable answer, and appeared to me to be extremely
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb93" href="#v2pb93" name=
"v2pb93">93</a>]</span>proud and self-satisfied, with all his
ignorance. I considered the best thing for him would be that he should
remain some time in the prison of correction until the heat of his
temperament and confusion of his brain were somewhat quenched, and the
excitement of the people also should subside. He was accordingly handed
over to An&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299; Singh-dalan to be imprisoned in
Gwalior fort.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 25th K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d, my
fortunate son Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z came from Allahabad, and
with prostration at the threshold of the Khalifate illuminated the
forehead of sincerity. After he had performed the ceremony of kissing
the ground and been honoured with special favour, I bade him sit. He
presented 2,000 muhars and 2,000 rupees by way of <i>nazr</i>, and made
an offering of a diamond. As his elephants had not yet arrived, he
would produce them on another occasion. He had brought with him to the
Court, which is the asylum of the world, R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n,
Zamindar of Ratanp&#363;r, against whom this my son had by order sent
an army, and had taken from him as an offering 80 elephants and Rs.
100,000. My son brought him with him, and he had the good fortune to
kiss the threshold. Waz&#299;r K., my son&rsquo;s Diwan who is one of
the old servants of the Court, having had the good fortune to pay his
respects to me, presented as offerings 28 elephants, male and female.
Of these nine were accepted, and the rest bestowed on him.</p>
<p class="par">As it had been represented to me that Muruwwat K., s.
Iftik&#863;h&#257;r K., who was one born and bred up at this Court, had
fought with a band of Maghs on the borders of Bengal and had sacrificed
his life, I promoted All&#257;h-y&#257;r, his brother, to the mansab of
1,000 personal and 500 horse, and another brother to that of 400
personal and horse, so that those he had left behind should not be
distressed. On Monday, the 3rd of the Divine month of T&#299;r, in the
neighbourhood of the city four black bucks, a doe, and a fawn were
taken. As I passed by the house of my fortunate son, Sult&#257;n
Parw&#299;z, he presented two tusked elephants with their trappings by
way of offering; both were ordered to be placed in the private
elephant-stud.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 13th, Sayyid H&#803;asan, the
ambassador of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb94" href="#v2pb94"
name="v2pb94">94</a>]</span>my happy brother, S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;Abb&#257;s, ruler of Persia, having had the good fortune to kiss
the threshold, produced a letter, together with a crystal drinking-cup,
on the cover of which was a ruby. As it was given from excessive
friendship and sincerity it was the cause of the increase of amity and
good fellowship. On this day Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K. was promoted to
the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and Na&#7779;ru-llah, s.
Fath&#803;u-llah, in whose charge was the fort of Ambar, that of 1,500
personal and 400 horse. On Thursday, the 20th, Am&#257;nu-llah, s.
Mah&#257;bat K., was promoted to the mansab of 1,500 personal and 800
horse. Having conferred on Waz&#299;r K. the Diwanship of Bengal, I
gave him a horse, a dress of honour, and a jewelled dagger. Elephants
were given to M&#299;r H&#803;us&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n and Zabar-dast K.
On this day H&#803;&#257;fiz&#803; H&#803;asan, a servant of
K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, came to Court with a precious letter
from my brother S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s, and a report from
that pillar of the Sultanate (K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam). He laid
before me a dagger the hilt of which was made of a
fish&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11772src" href="#xd24e11772"
name="xd24e11772src">24</a> tooth spotted with black, that my brother
had given to K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam. As it was a great rarity,
he (K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam) had sent it to me. I greatly
approved of it; in fact, it is a rare present. I had never seen a
spotted one until now, and I was much pleased.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 27th, M. W&#257;l&#299; was promoted to
the mansab of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 24th, I gave 1,000
darbs as a present to Sayyid H&#803;asan, the ambassador, and an
elephant to &#703;Abdu-llah K. Bah&#257;dur F&#299;r&#363;z-jang. On
Thursday, the 2nd of the Divine month of Amurd&#257;d, a horse was
presented to I&#703;tib&#257;r K. &#703;&#256;qil K. was promoted to
the mansab of 1,000 personal and 800 horse.</p>
<p class="par">On the night of Saturday, the 4th of the Il&#257;h&#299;
month of Amurd&#257;d, corresponding with 15 S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n,
was the feast of the S&#863;hab-i-bar&#257;t. By order, they decorated
and brought <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb95" href="#v2pb95" name=
"v2pb95">95</a>]</span>before me on the river, boats with lamps and all
kinds of fireworks. In truth, the lamps they had arranged appeared very
pretty, and for a long time I enjoyed myself in going round and looking
at them. On Tuesday, M&#299;r&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id=

N&#257;d &#703;Al&#299; Maid&#257;n&#299;, who was one of the
well-brought-up khanazads, was selected for the mansab of 700 personal
and 500 horse, and K&#863;hw&#257;ja Zainu-d-d&#299;n for that of 700
personal and 300 horse, and K&#863;hw&#257;ja Muh&#803;sin for that of
700 personal and 100 horse. On Thursday, the 9th, I went to hunt at the
village of Sam&#363;nagar. Passing my time pleasantly in going round
and hunting on that pleasant plain until Monday, I returned on the eve
of Tuesday to the palace. On Thursday, the 16th, Bis&#863;h&#363;tan,
grandson of S&#863;haik&#863;h Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l (the author), was
promoted to the mansab of 700 personal and 350 horse. On this day I
went round to see the garden of Gul-afs&#863;h&#257;n, which is on the
bank of the Jumna. On the way rain fell heavily and filled the mead
with freshness and greenness. Pineapples had arrived at perfection, and
I made a thorough inspection. Of the buildings that overlooked the
river none<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11797src" href="#xd24e11797"
name="xd24e11797src">26</a> that I saw were without the charm of
verdure and flowing water. These verses of Anwar&#299; appeared
appropriate to the place:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<h4><span class="sc">Verse.</span></h4>
<p class="line">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a day of mirth and jollity,</p>
<p class="line">A daily market of flowers and odours;</p>
<p class="line">The earth-heaps are suffused with ambergris,</p>
<p class="line">The zephyr sheds rose-water from his skirt,</p>
<p class="line">From contact with the morning breeze the pool</p>
<p class="line">Is roughened and pointed, like the edge of a
file.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">As this garden is in the charge of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, he presented me as offerings with some
pieces of brocade of a new fashion they had lately brought for him from
&#703;Ir&#257;q. Selecting what I approved of, I presented the
remainder to him. He had arranged the garden well, and his mansab was
ordered to be raised to 5,000 personal and 3,000 horse, original and
increased. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb96" href="#v2pb96" name=

<p class="par">A strange circumstance was that I was so much delighted
with a jewelled dagger-hilt of piebald teeth which K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam had got from S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s and sent
to me (see <i>ante</i>), that I appointed several skilful men to go to
&#298;r&#257;n and T&#363;r&#257;n to look for them and to be
consistently searching for them, and to bring some from anywhere and
any person, anyhow, and at any price. Many of my servants who knew my
disposition, and dignified Am&#299;rs in the course of their duty,
engaged in the search. It happened that in this city a stupid stranger
bought in the open bazaar a coloured tooth of great beauty and delicacy
for a trifle; he believed that some time or other it had fallen into
the fire, and that the black on it was the mark of burning! After some
time he showed it to one of the carpenters on the establishment of my
prosperous son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, desiring that he should take
off a piece of the tooth in order to make a ring (<i>s&#863;hast</i>),
and pointed out that he should remove the marks of burning and the
blacknesses, being ignorant that the blackness enhanced the value and
price of the whiteness. Those moles and patches were what the tirewoman
of destiny had given as an adornment of its beauty. The carpenter at
once went to the Superintendent of his workshop, and gave him the good
news that such a rare and precious thing, in search of which people
were wandering and going long distances, and hastening to all corners
and in all directions in various countries, had fallen for nothing into

easily and cheaply obtained from him. The Superintendent went off with
him and immediately procured it, and next day produced it before my
son. When my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n came to wait on me, he at
first showed great delight, and after his brain had become free from
the intoxication of the wine of joy, produced it, and greatly pleased
me&mdash;</p>

out of sincerity, I bestowed on him unstinted favours, and presented
him with a dress of honour, a horse, a sword, and 10,000 darbs, with
the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. At this time a petition
came from K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n, stating that: &ldquo;Your
Majesty, from the perfection of kindness and knowledge of his worth,
had appointed to the government of Thatta (Sind) an old slave,
notwithstanding his great age and weak sight. As this weak old man was
exceedingly bent and decrepit, and had not in him the ability to exert
himself or to ride, he prays that he may be excused military service,
and that he may be enrolled in the army of prayer.&rdquo; At his
request, I ordered the chief Diwans to confirm him in the pargana of

and which he for a long time had held as a <i>tank&#863;hw&#257;h</i>
jagir, and which had become peopled and cultivated, by way of providing
for his expenses, so that he might pass his time in easy circumstances.
His eldest son, by name S&#863;h&#257;h Muh&#803;ammad, was promoted to
the mansab of 1,000 personal and 600 horse, his second son,

over difficult hilltops might be accomplished with ease, and that the
men should not undergo labour and hardship. A large number of
artificers, such as stone-cutters, carpenters, spadesmen, etc., were
despatched with him, to whom an elephant was also given. On the eve of
Thursday, the 13th, having gone to the garden of N&#363;r-manzil, I
passed the time in enjoyment in that rose-garden of delight until
Sunday, the 16th. R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t Baghela came from the
fort of M&#257;ndp&#363;r, which is his native place, and had the good
fortune to kiss the threshold, and by way of offering presented an
elephant and a jewelled plume. Maq&#7779;&#363;d K. was honoured with
the mansab of 1,000 personal and 130 horse. On Thursday, the 20th, my
son S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z produced two elephants as an offering,
and they were ordered to be included in the private stud. On the 24th
of the aforesaid month the feast of the solar weighing took place in
the palace of Maryamu-z-zam&#257;n&#299;, and my 51st year according to
the solar months began in gladness and victory. It is hoped that the

S&#863;haww&#257;l, when the disk of the moon was perfect (at full

place. On the 1st of the Divine month, out of the veined

as the Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; fashion. At the same time the blade and
the sheath and fastenings were given to skilful men, each of whom was
unique in his age in his art. Truly, it was all carried out according
to my wish. One hilt came out coloured in such a way as to create
astonishment. It turned out of all the seven colours, and some of the
flowers looked as if a skilful painter<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e11886src" href="#xd24e11886" name="xd24e11886src">33</a> had
depicted them in black lines round it with a wonder-working pencil. In
short, it was so delicate that I never wish it to be apart from me for
a moment. Of all the gems of great price that are in the treasury I
consider it the most precious. On Thursday I girded it auspiciously and
with joy round my waist, and the masters who in their completion had
exercised great skill and taken great pains were rewarded, Ust&#257;d
P&#363;ran with the gift of an elephant, a dress of honour, and a
golden bracelet for the wrist, which the people of India call

<p class="par">As it had been represented to me that Am&#257;nu-llah,

<p class="par">On Saturday the 5th, news came of the death of R&#257;ja
S&#363;raj Singh, who had died a natural death in the Deccan. He was
the descendant of M&#257;ldeo, who was one of the principal Zamindars
of Hindustan, and had a zamindari which equalled that of the
R&#257;n&#257;, and he had even overcome him in one battle. There is a
full account of him (M&#257;ldeo) in the Akbar-n&#257;ma. R&#257;ja
S&#363;raj Singh, through the advantage of his being brought up by the
late king (Akbar), and this suppliant <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb100" href="#v2pb100" name="v2pb100">100</a>]</span>at the throne
of God, reached high rank and great dignities. His territory surpassed
that of his father or grandfather.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11913src"
href="#xd24e11913" name="xd24e11913src">35</a> He had a son called Gaj

affairs. As I knew him to be capable and worthy of favour, I promoted
him to the mansab of 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, with a standard
and the title of Raja, and his younger brother to that of 500 personal
and 250 horse, and gave him a jagir in his native country.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 10th of Mihr, at the request of
&#256;&#7779;af K., I went to his house built on the bank of the Jumna.
He has erected a very fine bath-house (h&#803;amm&#257;m), with which I
was much delighted. After bathing, a feast of cups was held, and my
private servants were made happy with cups of delight. Having chosen
out of his offerings what I approved, I gave the remainder to him. What
I took of his offering might be of the value of Rs. 30,000. B&#257;qir
K., faujd&#257;r of Multan, was honoured with a standard.</p>
<p class="par">Previously to this, according to order, they had planted
trees on both sides from Agra as far as the River of Attock (the
Indus), and had made an avenue, and in the same way from Agra to
Bengal. I now ordered that from Agra to Lahore they should put up a
pillar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11925src" href="#xd24e11925" name=
"xd24e11925src">37</a> (<i>m&#299;l</i>) at every koss, to be the sign
of a koss, and at every three koss make a well, so that wayfarers might
travel in ease and contentment, and not endure hardships from thirst or
the heat of the sun.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 24th of Mihr, the festival of the
Dasahr&#257; was held. After the custom of India, they decorated the
horses and produced them before me. After I had seen the horses they
brought some of the elephants. As Mu&#703;tamid K. on last New
Year&rsquo;s Day had not made any offering, at this festival he
presented a golden tablet (<i>tak&#863;ht</i>), a ruby ring, a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb101" href="#v2pb101" name=
"v2pb101">101</a>]</span>piece of coral (<i>bussad</i>), and other
items. The tablet was beautifully made. The total value of the offering
was Rs. 16,000. As he had brought the things from pure sincerity and
loyalty, they were accepted. On this day Zabar-dast K. was promoted to
the mansab of 1,000 personal and 400 horse. As the day of the
Dasahr&#257; had been fixed as the time of starting, I embarked on a
boat with all happy omens and pleasure in the evening, and went on to
my goal. I halted for eight days at the first stage that the men might
come on, after making all preparations at leisure. Mah&#257;bat K. had
sent apples from Bangash by runners (<i>d&#257;k-chok&#299;</i>). They
arrived very fresh, and were of excellent flavour. I was greatly
pleased in eating them. They cannot be compared with the
<i>s&#299;b-i-k&#863;h&#363;b</i> (&ldquo;the good<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e11949src" href="#xd24e11949" name="xd24e11949src">38</a>
apples&rdquo;?) of Kabul which I ate there, or with the Samarkand
apples that they bring every year. For sweetness and delicacy of
flavour they cannot be compared with either of the latter (<i>i.e.</i>,
the Bangash apples were far better). I had until now never seen such
delicate and delicious apples. They say that in Upper Bangash, near
Lashkar-dara,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11958src" href="#xd24e11958"
name="xd24e11958src">39</a> there is a village called S&#299;v
R&#257;m, in which there are three trees of this apple, and although
they have made many trials, they have never found so good ones in any
other place. I gave Sayyid H&#803;asan, ambassador of my brother
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s, a dish of these apples in order that
he might tell me if there were any better apples in &#703;Ir&#257;q. He
said: &ldquo;In the whole of Persia the apples of Isfahan are
preferred, and they are of the same quality as these.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 1st of the Divine month of
&#256;b&#257;n, I went on pilgrimage to the mausoleum of the late king
(Akbar) (may the lights of Allah be his testimony!), and rubbed the
head of supplication on the threshold, the abode of angels, and
presented 100 muhars as nazar. All the Begams and other ladies, having
sought the blessing of circulating round that shrine, which is the
circling-place of angels, presented offerings. On the eve of Friday a
lofty assembly was held <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb102" href=
"#v2pb102" name="v2pb102">102</a>]</span>of the holy men
(<i>Mas&#863;h&#257;&#702;ik&#863;h</i>), the turbaned people
(<i>arb&#257;b-i-&#703;am&#257;&#702;im</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
ecclesiastics, etc.), <i>H&#803;uff&#257;z&#804;</i> (those who recite
the Qoran), and singing people, assembled in numbers, and practised
ecstasies and religious dancing (<i>wajd</i> and
<i>sam&#257;&#703;</i>), to each of whom, according to the
circumstances of his merit and skill, I gave a dress of honour, a
<i>farj&#299;</i>, and a shawl. The buildings of this blessed mausoleum
have been made very lofty. At this time the money expended satisfied
me, and was far more than it had previously been. (The MS.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e11987src" href="#xd24e11987" name=
"xd24e11987src">40</a> here is clear, and the printed words wrong.)</p>
<p class="par">On the 3rd, after four gharis of day had passed, I
marched on from that stage, and having traversed 5&frac12; koss by the
river at four gharis of the day, arrived at the next stage. After
midday I left the boat and caught seven partridges
(<i>durr&#257;j</i>). At the end of the day I gave Rs. 20,000 to Sayyid
H&#803;asan, the ambassador (of Persia), as a present, and a dress of
honour of gold brocade with a jewelled <i>j&#299;g&#863;ha</i>
(turban-ornament), and an elephant, and gave him leave to return, and
sent for my brother with him a jewelled jug made in the shape of a
cock, which could hold my usual stint of wine. It is hoped that it may
reach its destination in safety. I gave leave to Las&#863;hkar K., who
had been appointed to the defence and government of Agra, with a gift
of a dress of honour, a horse, an elephant, drums, and a jewelled
dagger. Ikr&#257;m K. was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and
1,500 horse, and to the duty of faujd&#257;r of the Sark&#257;r of
Mewat. He is s. Isl&#257;m K., who was the grandson of the venerable
asylum of pardon S&#863;haik&#863;h Sal&#299;m, whose excellency of
person and approved disposition and connection in blessing with this
illustrious family have been described in these pages with the pen of
sincerity.</p>
<p class="par">At this time I heard from a certain person whose words
are adorned with the light of truth that at the time when I was sick
and weak at Ajmir, before this evil news arrived <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb103" href="#v2pb103" name=
"v2pb103">103</a>]</span>in the province of Bengal, one day Isl&#257;m
K. was sitting in private, when he suddenly became unconscious. When he
came to himself he said to one of his confidants, of the name of
Bh&#299;kan, that it had been shown him from the world of mysteries
that the holy person of the Emperor had been attacked by sickness, and
that the remedy for it was to sacrifice for him something that was
exceedingly dear and precious to himself. It at first occurred to him
to sacrifice for the head of the revered one his own son
H&#363;s&#863;hang, but as he was young in years and as yet had derived
no profit from life, and not attained to the desire of his heart, he
had compassion on him, and would sacrifice himself for his lord and
master. He hoped that as this was from the bottom of his heart, and the
sincerity of his being, it would be accepted at the throne of Allah.
The arrow of prayer at once reached the target of acceptance, and he
perceived himself afflicted with weakness and disease. Verily, verily,
the disease increased till he reached the neighbourhood of the
compassion of God (he died). The Great Physician bestowed from the
hidden dispensary complete recovery on this suppliant. Although the
late king (the lights of Allah be his testimony!), was much attached to
the children and grandchildren of the S&#863;haik&#863;hu-l-Isl&#257;m,
and bestowed favours on them all according to the capacity and aptitude
of each, yet when the turn of rule came to this suppliant, they
received great kindnesses in order to perform what was due to that
revered one (Sal&#299;m Chis&#863;ht&#299;), and many of them attained
to the high nobility, and were advanced to the posts of head of Subahs,
as has been brought to record each in its own place.</p>
<p class="par">As in this village the eunuch Hil&#257;l K.,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e12007src" href="#xd24e12007" name=

I was prince, had built a <i>sar&#257;y</i>, and made a garden, he made
an offering to me. In order to dignify him I took a trifle from him.
After marching four stages from this halting-place, the army of
prosperity encamped outside Mathura. On Thursday, the 8th, I went to
see Bindr&#257;ban and the idol temples of that place. <span class=

offering, a ruby and jewelled aigrette (t&#804;urra). On Friday, the
9th, Rs. 600,000 of treasure for the maintenance

lived as a hermit in Ujain. At this time he changed his residence to
Mathura, which is one of the greatest places of worship of the Hindus,
and employed himself in the worship of the true God on the bank of the
Jumna. As I valued his society, I hastened to wait on him, and for a
long time enjoyed his company without the presence of any stranger. In
truth, his existence is a great gain to me: one can be greatly
benefited and delighted.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 10th, the huntsmen represented that
there was in that neighbourhood a tiger that greatly troubled
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb105" href="#v2pb105" name=
"v2pb105">105</a>]</span>and injured the ryots and wayfarers. I
immediately ordered them to bring together a number of elephants and
surround the forest and at the end of the day myself rode out with my
ladies. As I had vowed that I would not injure any living thing with my
own hand, I told N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e12057src" href="#xd24e12057" name="xd24e12057src">45</a> to shoot
at him. An elephant is not at ease when it smells a tiger, and is
continually in movement, and to hit with a gun from a litter
(<i>&#703;im&#257;r&#299;</i>) is a very difficult matter, insomuch
that M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam, who, after me, is unequalled in shooting,
has several times missed three or four shots from an elephant. Yet
N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n B. so hit the tiger with one shot that it was
immediately killed.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 12th, my desire to see the
Gos&#257;&#702;&#299;n Jadr&#363;p again increased, and hastening to
his hut, without ceremony, I enjoyed his society. Sublime words were
spoken between us. God Almighty has granted him an unusual grace, a
lofty understanding, an exalted nature, and sharp intellectual powers,
with a God-given knowledge and a heart free from the attachments of the
world, so that, putting behind his back the world and all that is in
it, he sits content in the corner of solitude and without wants. He has
chosen of worldly goods half a <i>gaz</i> of old cotton
(<i>kirp&#257;s</i>) like a woman&rsquo;s veil, and a piece of
earthenware from which to drink water, and in winter and summer and the
rainy season lives naked and with his head and feet bare. He has made a
hole in which he can turn round with a hundred difficulties and
tortures, with a passage such that a suckling could hardly be put
through it. These two or three couplets of H&#803;ak&#299;m
San&#257;&#702;&#299; (may God have mercy on him!) appeared

On Thursday the 15th, I marched and pitched near Brind&#257;ban. At
this stage my fortunate son Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z took leave of
me for Allahabad, and went to his jagir. I had intended that he should
accompany me on this expedition, but as he had already shown symptoms
of distress, I could not avoid letting him go. I presented him with a

(<i>jauhar-d&#257;r</i>) walrus-tooth (hilt), and a sword and special
shield. I hope he will come again soon, and have the good fortune of my
presence. As the period of K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s imprisonment had been

deprive him of the good fortune of waiting on me, would be wanting in
kindness. I accordingly sent<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12211src" href=
"#xd24e12211" name="xd24e12211src">47</a> for him and bade him salute
me. Once again the marks of his offences were washed with the pure
water of forgiveness, and the dust of disgrace and humiliation was
rubbed off his brow. I hope that the blessing of pleasing me, and the
grace of service may be his lot.</p>
<p class="par">On Friday, the 16th, I gave leave to Muk&#863;hli&#7779;
K., whom I had sent for to take up the duties of diwan to
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z, and I gave him the rank he had<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e12216src" href="#xd24e12216" name=
"xd24e12216src">48</a> had in Bengal&mdash;viz., 2,000 with 700 horse.
On Saturday I halted. At this stage Sayyid Niz&#803;&#257;m s. M&#299;r
M&#299;r&#257;n &#7778;adr Jah&#257;n, who was faujd&#257;r of Kanauj,
waited upon me, and presented two elephants, and some hawks. I accepted
one elephant and a pair of hawks. On Sunday, the 18th, we marched. At
this time the King of Persia had sent with Par&#299; Beg M&#299;r
S&#863;hik&#257;r (chief <span class="corr" id="xd24e12225" title=
"Source: hunstman">huntsman</span>) one falcon (s&#863;hunq&#257;r) of
good colour. There was another which had been given to the
K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam. This one was sent along with the
S&#863;h&#257;h&#299; falcon (<i>i.e.</i>, the one intended for
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r), and it died on the road. The S&#863;h&#257;h&#299;
falcon, too, got mauled by a cat owing to the carelessness of the
M&#299;r S&#863;hik&#257;r. Though it was brought to Court, it did not
live more than a week. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb108" href=
"#v2pb108" name="v2pb108">108</a>]</span>What can I write<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e12233src" href="#xd24e12233" name=
"xd24e12233src">49</a> of the beauty and colour of this falcon? There
were many beautiful black markings on each wing, and back, and sides.
As it was something out of the common, I ordered Ust&#257;d
Man&#7779;&#363;r, who has the title of
<i>N&#257;diru-l-&#703;a&#7779;r</i> (wonder of the age) to paint and
preserve<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12240src" href="#xd24e12240" name=
"xd24e12240src">50</a> its likeness. I gave the M&#299;r
S&#863;hik&#257;r Rs. 2,000 and dismissed him.</p>
<p class="par">In my father&rsquo;s reign (the light of God be his
testimony!) the weight of the seer was 30 dams.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e12247src" href="#xd24e12247" name="xd24e12247src">51</a> About
this time it came into my mind: &ldquo;Why should I act contrary to his
rules?&rdquo; It would be better to have it still of 30 dams. One day
Gos&#257;&#702;&#299;n Jadr&#363;p said that in the book of the Vedas,
which the lords of his faith had written, the weight of the
<i>s&#299;r</i> was 36 dams. &ldquo;As from the coincidences of the
hidden world your order has fallen in with what is laid down in our
book, if it be fixed at 36 dams, it will be well.&rdquo; It was ordered
that hereafter throughout the whole territory it should be 36 dams.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 19th, I marched. A horse and dress of
honour were given to R&#257;ja Bh&#257;o Singh, who had been ordered to
the support of the army of the Deccan. From this day, till Wednesday,
the 28th, I made successive marches. On Thursday, the 29th, Delhi, the
abode of blessings, was adorned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb109"
href="#v2pb109" name="v2pb109">109</a>]</span>by the alighting of the
army of good fortune. At first I hastened with my children and the
ladies on a visit to the enlightened shrine of Hum&#257;y&#363;n (may
the lights of God be his testimony!), and having made our offerings
there, went off to circumambulate the blessed mausoleum of the king of
holy men (S&#863;haik&#863;h Niz&#804;&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n
Chis&#863;ht&#299;), and strengthened my courage, and at the end of the
day alighted at the palace, which had been got ready in Sal&#299;mgarh.
On Friday, the 30th, I halted. As they had at this time preserved the
hunting-place of the pargana of P&#257;lam, according to order, it was
represented that a great number of antelope had collected there.
Accordingly, on the 1st of the Divine month of &#256;z&#817;ar I
started to hunt<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12285src" href="#xd24e12285"
name="xd24e12285src">52</a> with cheetahs. At the end of the day,
during the hunt, much hail fell of the size of apples, and made the air
very cold. On this day three antelope were caught. On Sunday, the 2nd,
I hunted 46 antelope, and on Monday, the 3rd, 24 antelope were caught
with cheetahs. My son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n killed two antelope
with his gun. On Tuesday, the 4th, five antelope were caught. On
Wednesday, the 5th, 27 antelope were caught. On Thursday, the 6th,
Sayyid Bahwa Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#299;, who was in charge of the
government of Delhi, made an offering of three elephants and eighteen
horses, and other things. One elephant and other things were accepted,
and I gave the rest to him. H&#257;s&#863;him of K&#863;host,
faujd&#257;r of some parganas in Mew&#257;t, had the honour of kissing
the threshold. I employed myself within the limits of P&#257;lam until
Thursday, the 13th, in hunting with cheetahs. In the space of twelve
days 426 antelopes were caught, and I returned to Delhi. I had heard,
when in attendance on my father, that it is impossible for an antelope
that has escaped from the grasp of a cheetah to live, although it has
not been injured by its claws. In this hunt I, in order to ascertain
the fact, released several antelopes of handsome appearance and strong
bodies, before they had received any wounds from teeth or claws, and
ordered them to be kept in my presence, and that they should be taken
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb110" href="#v2pb110" name=
"v2pb110">110</a>]</span>greatest care of. For a whole day and night
they remained at ease in their natural conditions: on the second day a
change was observed, and they threw about their legs as if they were
drunk, without any reason, and fell down and rose up. However much
<i>tiry&#257;q-i-f&#257;r&#363;q&#299;</i> (preparation of opium) and
other suitable medicines were administered to them, they had no effect,
and when one watch had passed in this condition, they died.</p>
<p class="par">On this day the bad news arrived that the eldest son of
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z had died at Agra. As he was somewhat
grown-up,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12295src" href="#xd24e12295" name=
"xd24e12295src">53</a> and was very attached and affectionate towards
his father, the latter was exceedingly grieved and wounded at heart at
this event, and great bewilderment and weakness manifested themselves
in him. In order to console and please him, I sent him gracious
letters, and covered over the deadly wound of his heart with the balm
of affection and kindness. I hope that God, the great and glorious, may
grant him patience and resignation, for in this kind of calamities
there can be no better driver away of grief than endurance and
resignation.</p>
<p class="par">On Friday, the 14th, at the request of
&#256;q&#257;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12306src" href="#xd24e12306"
name="xd24e12306src">54</a> &#256;q&#257;y&#257;n, I went to her house.
On account of her previous service and her hereditary attachment to
this illustrious family, when the late king made me a married man, he
took her from my sister S&#863;h&#257;h-z&#257;da K&#863;h&#257;nam,
and placed her in charge of my Zanana. It is 33 years from that date
that she has been in my service, and I esteem her greatly, for she has
served me with sincerity. In no journey or expedition had she of her
own will remained absent from attendance on me. When she felt her
increasing age, she requested me to order her to remain at Delhi, and
to spend the remainder of her life in prayer for me, for she had no
longer the power to move about, and found it a great hardship and
trouble to come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb111" href="#v2pb111"
name="v2pb111">111</a>]</span>and go (as she used). One of her
felicities was that she was of the same age<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e12311src" href="#xd24e12311" name="xd24e12311src">55</a> as
&#703;Ars&#863;h-&#257;s&#863;hy&#257;n&#299; (Akbar). In brief, with a
view to giving her rest, I ordered her to remain at Delhi, and in that
place she had made for herself a garden, a saray, and a tomb, in the
constructing which she has employed herself for some time past. In
short, to please this ancient servitor, I went to her house, and
strictly ordered Sayyid Bahwa, the governor of the city, to serve and
guard her in such a manner that no dust from any road of vexation might
settle on the hem of her contentment.</p>
<p class="par">On this day R&#257;ja Kis&#863;han D&#257;s was promoted
to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 300 horse, original and increased.
As Sayyid Bahwa<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12316src" href="#xd24e12316"
name="xd24e12316src">56</a> had performed satisfactorily the duties of
faujd&#257;r of Delhi, and the people of the place were much pleased
with his excellent conduct, according to previous custom, the
protection and administration of the city of Delhi and the
faujd&#257;rship of the surrounding country were entrusted to him, and
he was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 600 horse, original
and increased, and he was presented with an elephant, and allowed to
take leave. On Saturday, the 15th, I honoured M&#299;rz&#257;
W&#257;l&#299; with the mansab of 2,000 and 1,000 horse, and presenting
him with a standard and an elephant, appointed him to the Deccan.
S&#863;haik&#863;h &#703;Abdu-l-H&#803;aqq Dihlaw&#299;,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e12319src" href="#xd24e12319" name=
"xd24e12319src">57</a> who was a pious and estimable man, had the good
fortune to pay his respects to me. He had composed a book containing
the biographies of the Shaikhs of India, and produced it to me. He had
endured some hardships, and for a long time had lived in Delhi in
seclusion, and the practice of reliance on God, and of asceticism. He
is a very worthy man, and his company is not without pleasure (for me).
Bestowing various kinds of kindnesses on him, I dismissed him.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 16th, I marched from Delhi, and on
Friday, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb112" href="#v2pb112" name=
"v2pb112">112</a>]</span>the 21st, halted in the pargana of
Kair&#257;na.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12326src" href="#xd24e12326"
name="xd24e12326src">58</a> This pargana is the native place of
Muqarrab K. Its climate is equable and its soil good. Muqarrab had made
buildings and gardens there. As I had often heard praise of his garden,
I wished much to see it. On Saturday, the 22nd, I and my ladies were
much pleased in going round it. Truly, it is a very fine and enjoyable
garden. Within a masonry (<i>puk&#863;hta</i>, pucca) wall, flower-beds
have been laid out to the extent of 140 bighas. In the middle of the
garden he has constructed a pond, in length 220 yards, and in breadth
200 yards. In the middle of the pond is a <i>m&#257;h-t&#257;b</i>
terrace (for use in moonlight) 22 yards square. There is no kind of
tree belonging to a warm or cold climate that is not to be found in it.
Of fruit-bearing trees belonging to Persia I saw green pistachio-trees,
and cypresses of graceful form, such as I have never seen before. I
ordered the cypresses to be counted, and they came to 300. All round
the pond suitable buildings have been begun and are in progress.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 24th, K&#863;hanjar K., in whose charge
is the Fort of Ahmadnagar, was promoted to the mansab of 2,500 personal
and 1,600 horse. On Wednesday, the 26th, the Giver of Bounties gave my
son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n a son by the daughter of &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n. He presented an offering of 1,000 muhars, and begged
for a name for him. I gave him the name of Um&#299;d-bak&#863;hs&#863;h
(bestower of hope). I hope his advent<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e12337src" href="#xd24e12337" name="xd24e12337src">59</a> may be
auspicious to this State. On Thursday, the 27th, I halted. In these few
days I was delighted with hawking the <i>jarz</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e12342src" href="#xd24e12342" name="xd24e12342src">60</a> (bustard
or florican) and <i>t&#363;g&#863;h-d&#257;r&#299;</i> (also a kind of
bustard). I ordered the <i>jarz-i-b&#363;r</i> (the red bustard?) to be
weighed. It came to 2&frac14; <i>Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299;</i> sirs, and
the variegated (<i>ablaq</i>) one to 2&#8539; sirs. The large
t&#363;g&#863;h-d&#257;r&#299; was &frac14; sir heavier than the
jarz-i-b&#363;r. On Thursday, the 5th of the Divine month of Day, I
left the boat at Akbarpur, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb113"
href="#v2pb113" name="v2pb113">113</a>]</span>the victorious army then
marched by land. From Agra to this halting-place, which is situated
within two koss of the pargana of Buriya,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e12360src" href="#xd24e12360" name="xd24e12360src">61</a> is by
river 123 koss or 91 koss by road. I did it in 34 marches and 17 halts.
In addition to this I delayed a week in leaving the city, and 12 days
in sporting in P&#257;lam: altogether (I took) 70 days. On this day
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K. came from Bih&#257;r, and had the good
fortune to pay his respects. He presented 100 muhars and Rs. 100. From
the last Thursday to Wednesday, the 11th, I marched every day. On
Thursday, the 12th, I was pleased with going round to see the garden of
Sirhind. It is one of the old gardens, and has old trees in it. It has
not the freshness it formerly had, but it is still valuable.
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Wais&#299;, who is well acquainted with agriculture
and buildings, was appointed the <i>karor&#299;</i> of Sirhind for the
purpose of keeping the garden in order. I had sent him off from Agra
before I marched from the capital, and he had put it somewhat in order.
I strictly enjoined him again that he should remove all the old trees
that had no freshness in them, and put in fresh plants, to clean up the
<i>&#703;irqband&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e12368src" href=
"#xd24e12368" name="xd24e12368src">62</a> (it is
<i>&#703;ir&#257;q-band&#299;</i> in the text. The word does not occur
in the B.M. MS. but is in the I.O. MS.), and repair the old buildings,
and erect other buildings in the shape of baths, etc., in fitting
places. On this date D&#363;st Beg, who was one of the auxiliaries of
&#703;Abdu-llah K., was promoted to the mansab of 700 personal and 50
horse, Muz&#804;affar H&#803;usain, s. Waz&#299;r K., to that of 600
personal and 300 horse. S&#863;haik&#863;h Q&#257;sim was sent to duty
in the Deccan. On Thursday, the 19th, at the request of my auspicious
son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, I went to his house. On account of the
birth of the son that God Almighty had bestowed on him a grand
entertainment was given, and he presented offerings. Among these was a
short, broad sword<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12378src" href=
"#xd24e12378" name="xd24e12378src">63</a>
(<i>s&#863;hams&#863;h&#299;r-i-n&#299;mcha</i>), which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb114" href="#v2pb114" name=
"v2pb114">114</a>]</span>was of Venetian workmanship. The hilt and
fastenings were made of a sapphire<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12391src"
href="#xd24e12391" name="xd24e12391src">64</a> cut in Europe: in short,
it had been beautifully made. Another offering was an elephant which
the Raja of Bagl&#257;na had presented to my son in Burh&#257;npur. As
that elephant was handsome and well-behaved, it was ordered to be
included among the private elephants. The value of the offerings that
were accepted was Rs. 130,000, and he offered about Rs. 4,000 to his
mothers and benefactors. On this day Sayyid B&#257;yaz&#299;d
Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#299;, faujd&#257;r of Bhakkar, sent as an offering a
<i>rang</i> (ibex), which he had brought from the hills when it was
small and brought up in his house. It pleased me greatly. Of
<i>m&#257;r-k&#863;h&#363;r</i> and hill sheep I have seen many brought
up in the house, but I never saw a <i>rang</i> (tame). I ordered them
to keep it with the Barbary goats, in order that they might pair and
produce young ones. Without doubt, it is not allied to the
m&#257;r-k&#863;h&#363;r or the quchq&#257;r. Sayyid B&#257;yaz&#299;d
was raised to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 700 horse. On Monday,
the 23rd, having honoured Muq&#299;m K. with a robe of honour, a horse,
an elephant, and jewelled <i>khapwa</i>, I appointed him to Bih&#257;r.
On Sunday, the 29th, a feast was prepared for my auspicious son
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n on the bank of the Biya (Beas), and on the
same day R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, who was employed in the siege
of K&#257;ngra, came to Court, by order, to represent certain
requirements, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. On
Monday, the 30th, my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n took ten
days&rsquo; leave, and hastened to Lahore in order to see the palace
buildings lately erected. R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t was presented
with a special dagger, a robe of honour, and a horse, and returned to
duty on the siege of K&#257;ngra. On Wednesday, the 2nd of the Divine
month of Bahman, the garden of Kal&#257;naur was honoured by my halting
there. At this place my father had ascended the throne.</p>
<p class="par">When the news of the speedy arrival of K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam reached <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb115" href=
"#v2pb115" name="v2pb115">115</a>]</span>the Court, every day I sent
one of my servants to meet him. I loaded him with all kinds of favours
and kindnesses, and added to his rank and dignity, and I decked the
headings of the farmans sent to him with an impromptu hemistich or
couplet suitable to the occasion, and so filled him with favours. Once
I sent him some <i>Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299;</i> (otto of roses), and
this opening verse came on my tongue:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<h4><span class="sc">Verse.</span><a class="noteref" id="xd24e12424src"
href="#xd24e12424" name="xd24e12424src">65</a></h4>
<p class="line">&ldquo;To thee I&rsquo;ve sent the scent of myself.</p>
<p class="line">That I may bring thee the more quickly to
myself.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">On Thursday, the 3rd (Bahman), at the garden of
Kal&#257;naur, K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam was honoured by kissing
the threshold. By way of nazar he brought 100 muhars and Rs. 1,000, and
(stated that he) would present his offerings in due course. Zamb&#299;l
Beg, the ambassador of my brother S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s, was
following him with the royal letter and the rarities of that country
(Persia), which he had sent as presents. Of the favours and kindness
conferred by my brother on K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, if I were
to write of them in detail, I should be accused of exaggeration. In
conversation he always gave him the title of K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam, and never had him out of his presence. If he ever
voluntarily stayed in his own quarter, he (&#703;Abb&#257;s) would go
there without ceremony, and show him more and more favour. One day
there was a <i>qamurg&#863;ha</i> hunt at Farrukh&#257;b&#257;d, and he
ordered K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam to shoot with a bow. Out of
good manners he brought a bow with two arrows (only). The Shah gave him
50 other arrows from his own quiver. It happened that 50 of these
arrows struck the game, and two arrows missed. Then he ordered some of
his attendants who had the entr&eacute;e at feasts and assemblies to
shoot with arrows. Most shot well. Among them Muh&#803;ammad Y&#363;suf
(qar&#257;wul), shot an arrow which went through two boars, and those
who were standing by broke out without control into applause. At the
time K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam took his leave, he seized him in
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb116" href="#v2pb116" name=
"v2pb116">116</a>]</span>embrace of honour, and showed him great
affection. After he had left the city, he went to his halting-place,
and made many apologies and bade him farewell. As for the beautiful and
costly things that the K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam brought, it was
indeed the assistance of his destiny that gave such rare things into
his hand. Among them was the picture of the fight of &#7778;&#257;hib
Qir&#257;n (T&#299;m&#363;r) with Tuqtamis&#863;h K., and the
likenesses of him and his glorious children and the great Amirs who had
the good fortune to be with him in that fight, and near each figure was
written whose portrait it was. In this picture there were 240 figures.
The painter had written his name as K&#863;hal&#299;l M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h&#299; (in the MS. it is Savaj and not
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h&#299;). The work was very complete and grand,
and resembled greatly the paint-brush of Ust&#257;d Bihz&#257;d. If the
name of the painter had not been written, the work would have been
believed to be his. As it was executed before Bihz&#257;d&rsquo;s date
it is probable that the latter was one of K&#863;hal&#299;l
M&#299;rz&#257;&rsquo;s pupils, and had adopted his style. This
precious relic had been obtained from the illustrious library of
S&#863;h&#257;h Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l (the 1st), or had come to my
brother S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s from S&#863;h&#257;h
T&#804;ahm&#257;sp. A person of the name of &#7778;&#257;diq&#299;, a
librarian of his, had stolen it, and sold it to someone. By chance (the
painting) fell into the hands of K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam at
Isfahan. The Shah heard that he had found such a rare prize, and asked
it of him on the pretence of looking at it. K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam tried to evade this by artful stratagems, but when he
repeatedly insisted on it, he sent it to him. The Shah recognized it
immediately he saw it. He kept it by him for a day, but at last, as he
knew how great was our liking for such rarities, he&mdash;God be
praised&mdash;made no request<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12439src"
href="#xd24e12439" name="xd24e12439src">66</a> whatever for it, but
told the facts of the case (about its being stolen) to K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam, and made the picture over to him.</p>
<p class="par">At the time when I sent K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam
to Persia, I had sent with him a painter of the name of Bis&#863;han
D&#257;s, who was unequalled in his age for taking likenesses, to take
the portraits of the Shah and the chief men of his State, and bring
them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb117" href="#v2pb117" name=
"v2pb117">117</a>]</span>He had drawn the likenesses of most of them,
and especially had taken that of my brother the Shah exceedingly well,
so that when I showed it to any of his servants, they said it was
exceedingly well drawn.</p>
<p class="par">On the same day Q&#257;sim K., with the Bakhshi and
Diwan of Lahore, had the good fortune to do homage. Bis&#863;han
D&#257;s, the painter, was honoured with the gift of an elephant.
B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hw&#257;ja, who was one of the auxiliaries of
Qandahar, was accorded the mansab of 1,000 personal and 550 horse. On
Tuesday, the 3rd, <i>Mad&#257;ru-l-mah&#257;mm&#299;</i> (centre of
important affairs) I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula made ready his army.
Inasmuch as the charge of the Panjab is entrusted to his agents, and he
has also various jagirs in Hindustan, he held a review of 5,000
horsemen. As the area of Kashmir is not such that its produce may
suffice for the expenses of the force that is always on service with
the servants of the army of prosperity, and as, in consequence of the
report (of the approach) of the glorious and victorious standards, the
price of grains and vegetables had risen very high, an order was given,
for the comfort of the public, that those servants who were in
attendance on the royal stirrup should arrange their retinues, and only
taking with them those who were indispensable, should send the
remainder to their jagirs, and in the same way should take every
precaution to reduce as far as possible the number of their beasts and
followers. On Thursday, the 10th, my fortunate son,
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n returned from Lahore, and had the good
fortune to do homage. Having honoured Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K.
with a dress of honour, a horse and an elephant, I gave him leave to
proceed with his brothers and sons to the Deccan. On this day
T&#804;&#257;lib &#256;mul&#299; received the title of
<i>Maliku-s&#863;h-s&#863;hu&#703;ar&#257;</i> (king of poets), and was
clothed in a dress of honour. His origin was from &#256;mul. For some
time he was with I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula. As the merits of his style
surpassed that of his contemporaries, he was enrolled among the poets
of the throne. The following couplets are by him: <span class=

<p class="par">T&#804;&#257;lib (<i>i.e.</i>, B&#257;b&#257;
T&#804;&#257;lib) is by family an I&#7779;fah&#257;n&#299;. In his
early youth he went to Kashmir clothed as an ascetic and calendar, and
from the beauty of the place and the pleasantness of the climate set
his heart on the country and settled there. After the conquest of
Kashmir he joined the service of the late king (Akbar), and became
enrolled among the servants of the Presence. His age is now nearly 100
years, and he is now with his sons and dependants in Kashmir, engaged
in praying for the everlasting State.</p>
<p class="par">As it was reported to me that in Lahore one Miy&#257;n
S&#863;haik&#863;h Muh&#803;ammad M&#299;r by name, who was a Darvish,
a Sind&#299; by origin, very eloquent, virtuous, austere, of auspicious
temperament, a lord of ecstasy, had seated himself in the corner of
reliance upon God and retirement, and was rich in his poverty and
independent of the world, my truth-seeking mind was not at rest without
meeting him, and my desire to see him increased. As it was impossible
to go to Lahore, I wrote a note to him, and explained to him the desire
of my heart, and that saint, notwithstanding his great age and
weakness, took the trouble to come. I sate with him for a long time
alone, and enjoyed a thorough interview with him. Truly he is a noble
personage, and in this Age he is a great gain and a delightful
existence. This suppliant for Grace was taken out of himself by
companionship with him,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12537src" href=
"#xd24e12537" name="xd24e12537src">71</a> and heard from him sublime
words of truth and religious knowledge. Although I desired to make him
some gift, I found that his spirit was too high for this, and so did
not express my wish. I left him the skin of a white antelope to pray
upon, and he immediately bade me farewell and went back to Lahore.</p>
<p class="par">On Wednesday, the 23rd, I pitched my camp at
Daulat&#257;b&#257;d. A daughter of a gardener was brought before me
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb120" href="#v2pb120" name=
"v2pb120">120</a>]</span>who had a moustache and a thick beard as big
as the hilt of a sword. Her appearance was like that of a man. There
was hair in the middle of her chest as well, but she had no
breasts.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12544src" href="#xd24e12544" name=
"xd24e12544src">72</a> I discovered by her appearance that she ought
not to have children. I told some women to take her aside and examine
her, as perhaps she might be a hermaphrodite. They found she was in no
way different from other women. I have recorded this in this volume on
account of its strangeness.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 24th, B&#257;qir K., having come from
Multan, had the good fortune to pay his respects. In the preceding
pages it has been recorded that All&#257;h-d&#257;d, s.
Jal&#257;l&#257; T&#257;r&#299;k&#299;, had deserted from the
victorious army and taken the road to ruin. He now repented, and
through B&#257;qir K. petitioned I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula for pardon.
At the latter&rsquo;s request I ordered that if he repented of what he
had done, and turned his face in hope towards the Court, his crimes
would be forgiven. On this day B&#257;qir K. brought him to Court, and
at the intercession of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula, the traces of
disgrace and the dust of sorrow were washed off his forehead with the
pure water of pardon. Sangr&#257;m, Zamindar of Jammu, was honoured
with the title of Raja and the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse,
and was exalted with the gift of an elephant and a dress of honour.
G&#863;hairat K., faujd&#257;r of the D&#363;-&#257;b, was promoted to
the mansab of 800 personal and 500 horse. K&#863;hw&#257;ja Q&#257;sim
received the rank of 700 and 250 horse, and Taham-tan Beg, s.
Q&#257;sim Koka, received that of 500 personal and 300 horse. I gave
K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam a private elephant with trappings. From
this stage, having given B&#257;qir K. the mansab of 1,500 personal and
500 horse, I dismissed him again to his Subadarship.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 28th, I pitched in the pargana of
Karoh&#299;, which is on the bank of the Bihat (Jhelam). As this hilly
country is one of the established hunting-places, the huntsmen,
according to order, had come on in advance and prepared a <i>jarga</i>
(ring in which game is enclosed). On Wednesday, the 1st of the Divine
month of Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;, they drove <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb121" href="#v2pb121" name=
"v2pb121">121</a>]</span>in the game from six koss. On Thursday, the
2nd, they brought them into the enclosure, where 101 head of mountain
sheep and gazelles were taken. As Mah&#257;bat K. had been prevented
from the good fortune of coming before me for a long time, I ordered,
at his request, that if he was satisfied with the order of affairs, and
was not troubled with regard to any occurrence, he should leave his
forces at their posts (<i>th&#257;nas</i>), and come to Court
unattended. On this day he had the good fortune to kiss the threshold,
and presented 100 muhars as nazar. K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam was
promoted to the mansab of 5,000 personal and 3,000 horse. About this
time a written report came from N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299; that he
had repaired the P&#363;nch road, and levelled the defiles as far as
possible, but that snow fell for some days and nights, and lay on the
<i>kot&#257;ls</i> to the depth of three cubits. It was still falling,
and if I would delay outside the hills for a month, I could cross by
that route, otherwise it appeared difficult. As my intention in this
undertaking was to see the spring and the sprouting of bloom, my chance
of seeing this was lost by this delay, and I necessarily turned my
rein, and the royal standards proceeded by the way of Pakl&#299; and
Damt&#363;r. On Friday, the 3rd, I crossed the River Bihat (Jhelam),
although the water was waist-deep. As it was running very fast, and men
crossed with great trouble, I ordered them to take 200 elephants to the
fords, and cross the effects of the people over, and take across as
well those who were weak and feeble, so that there might be no loss of
life or goods.</p>
<p class="par">On this day news arrived of the death of Khw&#257;ja
Jah&#257;n. He was one of the old servants, and from the time when I
was prince. Although at last he left my service, and was for some time
in that of my father, yet as he had not gone to any strange place, this
did not weigh heavily on my mind. Accordingly, after my accession, I
did him such kindness as he had never conceived possible, and gave him
the mansab of 5,000 personal and 3,000 horse. I take this opportunity
to record in this volume an account of his idiosyncrasy. He became
practised in great affairs and acquired a wonderful skill in business.
His capabilities were the result of labour, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb122" href="#v2pb122" name=
"v2pb122">122</a>]</span>and he was void of natural ability, and of the
other qualities which are the adornment of men&rsquo;s nature. On this
journey he suffered from heart-failure, but for some days, in spite of
illness and breakdown, he kept up with the march. When his weakness
increased, he was allowed to go back at Kal&#257;naur, and went to
Lahore, and there died a natural death.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e12566src" href="#xd24e12566" name="xd24e12566src">73</a></p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 4th of the aforesaid month, the camp
was pitched at the Fort of Roht&#257;s (in the Panjab). I favoured
Q&#257;sim K. with a horse, a sword, and a special shawl
(<i>parm-narm</i>, literally very soft, and Akbar&rsquo;s name for a
shawl, see Blochmann, 90). I gave him leave to go to Lahore. There was
a small garden by the roadside, and I inspected the blossoms.</p>
<p class="par">At this stage <i>t&#299;h&#363;</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd24e12581src" href="#xd24e12581" name="xd24e12581src">74</a> were
obtained. The flesh of the <i>t&#299;h&#363;</i> is better than that of
the partridge (<i>kabak</i>).</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 5th, M. H&#803;asan s. M&#299;rz&#257;
Rustam, was promoted to the rank of 1,000 with 400 horse, and was
appointed to the Deccan. Khw&#257;ja &#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f, the
chief fowler, also received the rank of 1,000 with 400 horse. At this
place I saw a flower, white inside, and red outside, while some of them
were red inside and yellow outside. In Persian they call it
<i>La&#703;la-i-b&#299;g&#257;na</i>, and in Hind&#299; <i>thal
kanal</i>. <i>Thal</i> means land, and as the lotus (kanal) is an
aquatic plant, they have called this land-lotus.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">On Thursday, the 9th, a report came from Dil&#257;war
K., Governor of Kashmir, containing the good news of the conquest of
Kis&#863;htw&#257;r. Details will be recorded by the pen of the
newswriter after he (Dil&#257;war) comes to the foot of the throne. I
sent him a gracious farman with a special dress of honour and a
jewelled dagger, and granted him the revenue <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb123" href="#v2pb123" name=
"v2pb123">123</a>]</span>of the conquered province for a year, as a
reward for this acceptable service. On Tuesday, the 14th, I halted at
H&#803;asan Abd&#257;l. As the occurrences on this road and particulars
of the stages have been related in detail in the account of the
expedition to Kabul, I shall not repeat them. From this place as far as
Kashmir, they will be written stage by stage, please Almighty God. From
the date on which, disembarking from a boat, I reached Akbarpur in
safety and prosperity, up to H&#803;asan Abd&#257;l, a distance of 178
koss, I took 69 days in 48 marches and 21 halts.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e12618src" href="#xd24e12618" name="xd24e12618src">76</a> As at
this place there is a spring full of water, and a cascade, and a very
beautiful reservoir, I halted here two days, and on Thursday, the 16th
(Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;), the feast of my lunar weighing took place.
The 53rd year, according to lunar calculation, of this suppliant at the
throne commenced auspiciously. As beyond this stage, hills, passes, and
many ups and downs were before us, the passage of the camp appeared a
difficult matter, and it was settled that H. M.
Maryamu-z-zam&#257;n&#299; and the other Begams should delay for some
days, and come on at leisure. Mad&#257;ru-l-mulk
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula al-K&#863;h&#257;q&#257;n&#299;,
&#7778;&#257;diq K. Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;, and Ir&#257;dat K.
M&#299;r-S&#257;m&#257;n, with the directors of the buildings and other
offices, should attend to their transit. At the same time Rustam
M&#299;rz&#257; &#7778;afaw&#299;, K&#863;h&#257;n-A&#703;z&#804;am,
and a number of other servants, obtained leave to go by the P&#363;nch
road, while the royal retinue went on with some privileged courtiers
(<i>manz&#804;&#363;r&#257;n-i-bis&#257;t&#804;-i-qarb</i>) and the
necessary servants. On Friday, the 17th, we marched 3&frac12; koss, and
halted at the village of Sultanpur.<a class="noteref" id=

people of this country that when it is not the rainy season, and there
is no sign of a cloud or lightning, a noise like the voice of the
clouds comes from this hill, which they called Garj (thunder). This
noise is heard every year or at least every two years. I had repeatedly
heard of this also when I was in attendance on the late king. I have
written this as it is not devoid of strangeness,<a class="noteref" id=

wisdom is from Allah. On Saturday, the 18th, marching 4&frac12; koss, I

with a <i>p&#363;st&#299;n</i> (sheepskin coat). This day there was a
drizzling rain till the end of the march. On the eve of Wednesday, the
22nd, also there was rain. In the morning snow fell, and as most of the
roads had become very slippery, the weak animals fell in every place,
and could not rise again, and 25 of my own elephants were lent to
assist<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12675src" href="#xd24e12675" name=

snow. On Thursday, the 23rd, Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain, Zamindar
of Pakli, had the good fortune to pay his respects: this is the
entrance to the Pakli country. It is a strange thing that when H. M.
Akbar came here it snowed at this stage, and it has now snowed as well.
For many years no snow has fallen, and there has even been little rain.
On Friday, the 24th, I marched 4 koss and pitched at the village of
Saw&#257;dnagar.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12692src" href=

Pakli. On Sunday, the 26th, I rode out to hunt partridges
(<i>kabak</i>), and at the end of the day, at the request of
Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain, went to his house, and increased his
dignity among his equals and neighbours. H. M. Akbar had also gone to
his house. He offered several kinds of horses, daggers, hawks, and
falcons. I presented him with the horses and daggers. I ordered the
hawks and falcons to be got ready<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12707src"

Sarkar of Pakli is 35 koss in length and 25 in breadth. On the east, on
two sides, is the hill country of Kashmir; on the west, Atak Benares
(Atak); on the north, Kator; and on the south, the Gakkar country. At
the time when Timur, after conquering Hindustan, turned his rein
backwards towards the capital of T&#363;r&#257;n, they say that he
placed in these regions this body of people, who were in attendance on
the victorious stirrup. They say themselves that they are
Q&#257;rlughs, but do not know for certain who was their leader at that
time. In fact, they are pure L&#257;haur&#299;s, and speak the same
language. The people of Dhant&#363;r think the same thing. In the time
of my father, one of the name of S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h was Zamindar
of Dhant&#363;r; now it is Bah&#257;dur, his son. Although they are all
related to one another, there are always disputes, as is usual with
Zamindars, about boundaries. They have always been loyal.
Sult&#804;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d, the father of Sult&#804;&#257;n
H&#803;usain and S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, both came to wait on me
when I was prince. Although Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain is seventy
years old, to all outward appearance there is no diminution in his
powers, and he can still ride and be as active as possible. In this
country they make <i>b&#363;za</i> (a beverage) from bread and rice,
which they call <i>sar</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12724src" href=
"#xd24e12724" name="xd24e12724src">92</a> It is much stronger than
<i>b&#363;za</i>, and the older it is the better. This <i>sar</i> is
their chief sustenance. They put this <i>sar</i> into a jar, and
fastening it up, keep it for two or three years in the house. Then they
take off the scum and call the liquor <i>&#257;chh&#299;</i>. The
<i>&#257;chh&#299;</i> can be kept for ten years, and according to
them, the older it is the better, and the shortest time in which they
use it is a year. Sult&#804;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d used to take cup
after cup of this <i>sar</i>; nay! he would drink a jar of it.
Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain is also addicted to it, and brought me
some of his choicest quality. I took some in order to try it. I had
also drunk it before. Its intoxicating effects are aphrodisiac, but its
taste is harsh. It appeared that they mix some <i>bh&#257;ng</i> (bang)
with it, which increases its intoxicating power. If there were no wine,
it could in case of necessity be used as a substitute. The fruits are
apricots, peaches, and pears (?) (amr&#363;d). <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb127" href="#v2pb127" name=
"v2pb127">127</a>]</span>As they do not cultivate them, but they spring
up of themselves, they are harsh-flavoured and unpleasant. Their
blossoms are a joy. Their houses are of wood, and are built after the
Kashmiri fashion. They have hawks, and horses, camels, cattle, and
buffaloes, and many goats and fowls. Their mules are small and are not
fit for heavy loads. As it was represented to me that some stages
farther on the cultivation was not such as to provide sufficient grain
for the royal camp, I gave an order that they should only take a small
advanced camp, sufficient for our needs and the necessary
establishments, and diminish the number of elephants, and take with
them provisions for three or four days; that they should take with them
only some of the immediate attendants on the royal stirrup, and that
the rest of the men should come on some stages behind under the command
of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan, the Bakhshi. In spite of
precautions and injunctions, it was found necessary to have 700
elephants for the advanced camp and the establishments.</p>
<p class="par">The mansab of Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain was 400
personal and 300 horse; I now promoted him to 600 personal and 350
horse, and conferred on him a robe of honour, a jewelled dagger, and an
elephant. Bah&#257;dur Dhant&#363;r&#299; was an auxiliary of the army
of Bangash. An order was given that he should hold the mansab, original
and increased, of 200 personal and 100 horse. On Wednesday, the 27th,
having marched 5&frac14; koss, and crossing by bridges the
Nainsukh,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12757src" href="#xd24e12757" name=
"xd24e12757src">93</a> I chose a halting-place. This Nainsukh (repose
of the eyes) flows from the North, and comes down from the hills of
D&#257;rd<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12760src" href="#xd24e12760" name=
"xd24e12760src">94</a> (?), which is between the country of Badakhshan
and Tibet. As at this place it forms two branches, they had, according
to order, prepared two wooden bridges for the crossing of the
victorious army, one 18 cubits and the other 14 cubits in length, with
a breadth each of 5 cubits. The way in which they make <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb128" href="#v2pb128" name=
"v2pb128">128</a>]</span>bridges in this country is to throw
pine-trees<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12765src" href="#xd24e12765"
name="xd24e12765src">95</a> on the surface of the water, and fasten the
two ends strongly to rocks, and having thrown on to these<a id=
"xd24e12774" name="xd24e12774"></a> thick planks of wood, make them
firm with pegs and ropes, and these, with a little repair, last for
years. Briefly, they made the elephants ford, whilst the horsemen and
foot passed over by the bridge. Sult&#804;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d
called this river Nainsukh&mdash;that is, &ldquo;Repose of the
eye.&rdquo; On Thursday, the 30th, having marched about 3&frac12; koss,
a halt was made on the bank of the Kis&#863;han Gang&#257;. On this
road there is a <i>kotal</i> of great height, the ascent being 1 koss,
and the descent 1&frac12; koss, which they call <i>P&#299;m darang</i>.
The reason for this name is that in the language of Kashmir they call
cotton (<i>pamba</i>) <i>p&#299;m</i>. As the rulers of Kashmir had
placed a superintendent there, who took duties from loads of cotton,
and delay takes place here for the collection of the duty, it has
become known as the <i>P&#299;m darang</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e12791src" href="#xd24e12791" name="xd24e12791src">96</a> (cotton
delay). After traversing the pass, there is a very fine and clear
waterfall. Having drunk my usual cups on the edge of the water in the
shade of the trees, I went on to my halting-place in the evening. There
was an old bridge over this river, 54 yards long and 1&frac12; yards
wide, which footmen crossed by. According to orders, another bridge was
prepared parallel to this, in length 53 yards and breadth 3 yards. As
the water was deep and swift, they took the elephants across without
loads, and the footmen and horses crossed by the bridge. By order of my
father, a very strong saray of stone and lime was erected on the top of
the ridge overlooking the river. One day before New Year&rsquo;s Day we
had sent Mu&#703;tamid K. forward to select a spot for the placing of
the throne and preparing the New Year&rsquo;s entertainment. This had
to be lofty and choice. By chance, as he crossed the bridge, there was
a ridge overlooking the water, green and pleasant. On the top of this
was a flat place of 50 cubits which one might say <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb129" href="#v2pb129" name=
"v2pb129">129</a>]</span>the rulers of fate had specially prepared for
such a day. The aforesaid officer had made ready everything necessary
for the New Year&rsquo;s feast on the top of that ridge, which was much
approved. Mu&#703;tamid K. was much applauded for this. The river
Kis&#863;han Gang&#257; comes from the south<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e12797src" href="#xd24e12797" name="xd24e12797src">97</a> and
flows northwards. The Bihat (Jhelam) comes from the East, and joining
the Kis&#863;han Gang&#257;, flows to the North. <span class=

Luqm&#257;n is the Eastern &AElig;sop, and there is much about him in
D&rsquo;Herbelot. In the second line the word translated
&ldquo;hollow&rdquo; is <i>gul&#363;g&#257;h</i>, literally
&ldquo;throat place,&rdquo; and the word for bosom is <i>s&#299;na</i>,
the whole expression being <i>s&#299;na-i-chang</i>. Chang is a harp or
lyre, and apparently the expression refers to the narrowness of the
space between the horns of a lyre (<i>chang</i>, which appears to be
the Jew&rsquo;s harp), or the sides of a harp. The fourth line is
obscure, and the version in text seems corrupt. The words
<i>s&#863;has&#863;h bidast d&#363; p&#257;y</i> seem unintelligible.
They, however, occur in I.O. MS. 181, f. 161a, and in I.O. MS. 305, f.
225<i>a</i>. The only difference is that they have a conjunction after
<i>bidast</i>. On the other hand, the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, which
inserts the lines into the record of the eleventh year, has, at p. 95,
a different reading for the fourth line. The words there are
<i>k&#863;h&#257;na yak bidast u sih pay</i>. <i>Bidast</i> is given in
Richardson, and the Farhang-i-Ras&#863;h&#299;d&#299; as meaning a
span, so the line as given in the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma may mean 3 feet
and 1 span. The author of the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma was so struck with
the verse of H&#803;ak&#299;m San&#257;&#702;&#299; and the appearance
of Jadr&#363;p&rsquo;s dwelling, that he composed a
<i>mas&#804;nav&#299;</i> on the subject, which he gives at pp. 95, 96.
There is a third version in Daulat S&#863;h&#257;h&rsquo;s anthology,
p. 97 of Professor Browne&rsquo;s edition. There, in the second line
we<a id="xd24e12109" name="xd24e12109"></a> have <i>h&#803;alqa</i>
(&ldquo;ring&rdquo;), or perhaps &ldquo;plectrum&rdquo; instead of
<i>s&#299;na</i>. We have also two lines not given in the T&#363;zuk or
the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, and the line containing the noodle&rsquo;s
question is given thus: &ldquo;K&#299;n chih j&#257;yast yak p&#363;st

of <i>d&#257;ms</i> in the Vedas is curious, for <i>d&#257;m</i> is
said to be derived from the Greek drachma. However, it appears from the
&#256;y&#299;n (Blochmann, 31), that the dam, though in value only the
fortieth part of a rupee, weighed 5 <i>t&#257;nks</i> or 1
<i>tol&#257;</i>, 8 <i>m&#257;s&#863;has</i>, 7 <i>surk&#863;hs</i>.
The rupee, we are told there, weighed 11&frac12;
mashas&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, half a masha less than a tola. Consequently
the dam weighed over 20 mashas, and so was not far from being equal in
weight to 2 rupees. The weight of a seer varied, and it may be 30 or 36
copper dams were reckoned as equal to a seer. By dam Jahangir probably
meant <i>pais&#257;</i>, or double <i>pais&#257;</i>. According to
Gladwin, 3&frac12; tanks are by jeweller&rsquo;s weights = one
tol&#257;, and a tank is 70&middot;112 grs. Troy.&nbsp;<a class=

<i>Ta&#7779;adduq s&#863;hud.</i> This is how Mr. Rogers has translated
the passage, and this seems to me to be right. Elliot has
&ldquo;lost,&rdquo; but surely Jah&#257;ng&#299;r would not pass over
so lightly the loss of 25 elephants. <i>Ta&#7779;adduq</i> is often
used in the sense of almsgiving, or of granting a favour. The text 290,
line 2, has <i>aks&#804;ar-i-r&#257;h basta b&#363;d</i>. The word
<i>basta</i> seems unintelligible, and in the corresponding passage of
the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, 135, the words are <i>aks&#804;ar-i-r&#257;h
ajama b&#363;d</i>. This word perhaps means &ldquo;muddy,&rdquo; and

<p class="par first">The transit of the sun, that fulfils the hopes of
the world, into his house of honour in Aries, took place on Friday, the
15th of the month of Rab&#299;&#703;u-s&#804;-s&#804;&#257;n&#299; in
the Hijr&#299; year 1029, (10 March), 1620, after 12&frac12; gharis, or
5 sidereal hours,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12825src" href=
"#xd24e12825" name="xd24e12825src">1</a> had passed, and the 15th year
of the reign of this suppliant at the throne of Allah commenced happily
and auspiciously. On Saturday, the 2nd (Farward&#299;n), having marched
4&frac12; koss, I halted at the village of Bakkar. On this road there
was no hill-pass (<i>kotal</i>), but it was rather stony. I saw
peacocks, black partridges, and monkeys (<i>lang&#363;r</i>), such as
exist in the Garms&#299;r country (Afghanistan). It is evident that
these can also exist in cold countries. From this place to Kashmir the
road is along the bank of the river Bihat. There are hills on both
sides, and in the bottom of the valley the water flows with great
force, boiling and raging. However large an elephant may be, he cannot
hold his feet firmly in it, but immediately rolls over, and is carried
away. There are also water-dogs<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12834src"
href="#xd24e12834" name="xd24e12834src">2</a> in the river. On Sunday,
the 3rd, marching 4&frac12; koss, I pitched at M&#363;sar&#257;n. On
the eve of Friday the merchants who live in the pargana of B&#257;ra
M&#363;la came and paid their respects. I asked the reason of the name
of B&#257;ra m&#363;la, and they represented that in the Hindi language
they call a boar <i>B&#257;r&#257;h</i> (<i>Varaha</i>) and m&#363;la
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb131" href="#v2pb131" name=
"v2pb131">131</a>]</span>a place&mdash;that is, the boars&rsquo; place.
Among the incarnations that belong to the religion of the Hindus, one
is the boar incarnation, and B&#257;r&#257;h m&#363;la by constant use
has become B&#257;ra m&#363;la. On Monday, the 4th, marching 2&frac12;
koss, I pitched at Bh&#363;lb&#257;s. As they said these hills were
very narrow and difficult (to pass), and they could be crossed by a
crowd of men only with great trouble, I gave orders to Mu&#703;tamid K.
that, with the exception of &#256;&#7779;af K. and a few of the
necessary attendants, no one should be allowed to march along with the
prosperous stirrup (with the king personally), and the camp should be
kept one stage behind. By chance, before this order was given, he had
sent on his own tent. After this he wrote to his men that this order
had been given with regard to him, and they should halt at whatever
spot they had reached. His brothers heard this at the foot of the kotal
of Bh&#363;lb&#257;s,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12857src" href=
"#xd24e12857" name="xd24e12857src">3</a> and pitched their own tent
there. When the royal host reached the place, snow and rain began to
fall. One plain of the road had not been crossed when his tent became
visible. Looking on this as a gift from the hidden world, I and the
ladies alighted, and remained protected from the cold and snow and
rain. His brothers, according to orders, sent someone in haste to
summon him. When the news reached him that the elephants and the
advance camp had arrived at the top of the <i>kotal</i>, and blocked up
the road, as it was impossible to ride, <i>with great zeal</i>, he, not
knowing his head from his feet, traversed a distance of 2&frac12; koss
on foot in two hours, and came to wait on me, and repeated this couplet
with the tongue of gesture.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12866src" href=

the way of money and goods, of live stock or dead, he offered for me to
tread upon. I gave them all back, and said: &ldquo;What do worldly
goods appear worth to the eye of our magnanimity? We buy the jewel of
loyalty at a high figure. Such an event arising out of his devotion
should be reckoned as the rising of his good star, in that a king like
me with the people of his harem should remain in his house in comfort
and at ease for a night and a day. It would be a cause of honour to him

as follows: He, according to orders, was coming up one stage in the
rear, and on the road it came into his mind that he would have a bathe
in the river, though warm water was ready. The people forbade him, and
said that when the air was so cold, unnecessarily to get into a river
so agitated and bloodthirsty that it would roll over a war-elephant,
was contrary to the dictates of caution. He was not restrained by their
words, and as the unavoidable destined time had arrived, got in. From
excessive self-will and pride and carelessness, in reliance on his
powers of swimming, in which art he was unequalled, he was more
determined than ever, and with a <i>k&#863;hidmat&#299;yya</i>
(Blochmann 252) and another servant, both of whom could swim, mounted a
rock on the river bank <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb133" href=

Immediately he fell, from the violent movement of the waves, he could
not pull himself together or try to swim; to fall in and go were the
same thing, and Suhr&#257;b K.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12920src"

patience, and showed great agitation. With all his dependants, clothed
in mourning garments, with head and feet bare, he came to wait on me.
What shall I write of the grief of the mother? Although the
M&#299;rz&#257; has other sons, his heart was bound up in this one. His
age was twenty-six years. In shooting with a gun he was an excellent
pupil of his father, and knew well how to drive elephants and
carriages. On the expedition to Gujarat he was often ordered to ride on
the front part of my private elephant, and he was an active
soldier.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12935src" href="#xd24e12935" name=

<p class="par">On Wednesday, the 6th, marching 3 koss, I pitched at the

the last of the <i>kotals</i> on the road. On Friday, the 8th, having

on this road. It was broad, and plain after plain, and mead after mead,
of flowers. Sweet-smelling plants of narcissus, violet, and strange
flowers that grow in this country, came to view. Among these flowers I
saw (noticed especially) one extraordinary one. It had five or six
orange flowers blooming with their heads downwards. From the middle of
the flowers there came out some green leaves, as in the case<a class=

flower like the <i>p&#363;y</i> (?), round which are small flowers of
the shape and colour of the jessamine, some blue in colour and some
red, with yellow points in the middle, exceedingly pretty in
appearance: its name is &ldquo;<i>ladar p&#363;s&#863;h</i>.&rdquo;

many yellow <i>arg&#863;haw&#257;n</i> (Judas-trees) on the road as
well. The flowers of Kashm&#299;r are beyond counting and calculation.
Which shall I write of? And how many can I describe? I have only
mentioned the most remarkable. There is a waterfall on this road, very
high and fine. It flows down from a high place. No other waterfall of
such beauty was seen on the road. I delayed a moment at it, and filled
my eye and heart with gazing on it from a high spot. On Saturday, the
9th, I marched 4&frac34; koss, and crossed over at
B&#257;ram&#363;la.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e12993src" href=

for entry (into Srinagar) had been fixed for Monday, when two watches
of the day had passed, on Sunday, the 10th, I entered
S&#863;hih&#257;bu-d-d&#299;n-p&#363;r. On this day Dil&#257;war K.
K&#257;kar, the Governor of Kashmir, came from

kiss the threshold. He was exalted with various royal favours and all
kinds of imperial gratifications. He had done his duty here in an
acceptable manner, and it is hoped that the great Giver of favours may
light up the foreheads of all my servants with honour.</p>
<p class="par">Kis&#863;htw&#257;r is to the south of Kashmir. From the
city of Kashmir (Srinagar) to the stage of Alkah (?),<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e13013src" href="#xd24e13013" name="xd24e13013src">19</a> which
is the capital of Kis&#863;htw&#257;r, the distance is 60 koss by
measurement. On the 10th of the Il&#257;h&#299; month of
S&#863;hahriwar, in my 14th year, Dil&#257;war K., with 10,000 horse
and foot, determined to conquer Kis&#863;htw&#257;r. He appointed his
son, Hasan by name, with Gird &#703;Al&#299; <i>M&#299;r-bah&#803;r</i>
(admiral) to guard the city and administer the territory. And as Gohar
Chak and Aiba Chak laid claim to Kashmir as heirs, and were stirring up
strife in Kis&#863;htw&#257;r, and were wandering in the valley of
confusion and ruin, he left Haibat, one of his brothers, with a force
at Des&#363;, which is near the <i>kotal</i> of P&#299;r Panj&#257;l,
by way of caution, and, dividing his forces at that place, he himself
hastened with a force by the road of Sang&#299;np&#363;r, sending his
son Jal&#257;l, with Na&#7779;ru-llah &#703;Arab, and &#703;Al&#299;
Malik Kas&#863;hm&#299;r&#299;, and a band of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299;
servants by another road, and his elder son Jam&#257;l with a band of
zealous young men as an advanced guard to his own force. At the same
time he placed two other forces to move forward on his right and left.
As no horses could go on the road, by way of precaution he took some
with him, but left <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb136" href=
"#v2pb136" name="v2pb136">136</a>]</span>nearly<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e13024src" href="#xd24e13024" name="xd24e13024src">20</a> all his
sipahis&rsquo; horses behind, and sent them to Kashmir (<i>i.e.</i>,
Srinagar). The young men girded the belt of duty on their waists, and
went up the hills on foot. The <i>g&#863;h&#257;z&#299;s</i> of the
army of Islam fought from post to post with the ill-fated unbelievers
as far as Narkot, which was one of the enemy&rsquo;s strongholds. There
the corps of Jal&#257;l and Jam&#257;l, which had been sent by
different roads, met, and the enemy, not having the power to oppose
them, took to flight. The brave ones who offered their lives traversed
many ups and downs with the courage of determination, and hastened on
to the Mar&#363; river. On the bank of that river the fire of slaughter
was lighted, and the <i>g&#863;h&#257;z&#299;s</i> of the army of Islam
displayed approved activity. The ill-fated Aiba Chak, with many of the
people of ruin, were slain. By the death of Aiba the Raja became
powerless and without heart, and took the road of flight, and, crossing
by the bridge, stopped at Bhandarko&#7789;, which is on the other side.
A band of the brave ones (<i>bah&#257;dur&#257;n</i>) quickly advanced,
wishing to cross the bridge. A great fight took place at its head, and
some of the young men attained to martyrdom. In this way for twenty
days and nights the servants of the Court tried to cross the river, and
the unbelievers of darkened fortune did not fail to attack and try to
drive them back, until Dil&#257;war K., after establishing
<i>th&#257;nas</i> and arranging for the commissariat, arrived with his
army. The Raja, by way of stratagem and vulpine trickery, sent his
Vakils to Dil&#257;war K., and begged that he might send his brother
with offerings to the Court, so that when his offences obtained pardon,
and his mind were freed from fear and trouble, he could also himself
proceed to the Court, the refuge of the world, and kiss the threshold.
Dil&#257;war K. did not lend his ear to these deceitful words, and did
not throw away from his hand the coin of opportunity. He dismissed the
envoys of the Raja without the attainment of their object, and made
every exertion to cross the bridge. His eldest son Jam&#257;l, with a
band of the crocodiles of the sea of bravery and valour, went up the
river, and by bravely swimming it although swollen crossed over, and
engaged in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb137" href="#v2pb137" name=
"v2pb137">137</a>]</span>a fierce battle with the enemy. The devoted
servants of the Court made an attack from the other side, and made
matters tight for these ruined people. These, when they found they had
no longer the strength to oppose them, broke down the planking of the
bridge, and took to flight. The victorious servants made the bridge
strong again, and transported the remainder of the army. Dil&#257;war
K&#863;h&#257;n drew up his forces at Bhandarko&#7789;. From the
aforesaid river (the Mar&#363;) to the Chen&#257;b, which is a strong
support of these unfortunate people, is a distance of two bow-shots,
and on the bank of the Chen&#257;b there is a lofty hill. The crossing
of the water is a difficult matter, and, with a view to the coming and
going of people on foot, they attach strong ropes, and place planks of
the width of a cubit between two ropes, and fasten one rope&rsquo;s end
to the top of the hill, and the other on the other side of the water.
Then they attach two other ropes a <i>gaz</i> higher than these, that
foot-passengers may place their feet on the planks, and, taking hold of
the upper ropes, may descend from the top of the hill to the bottom,
and so cross the river. This bridge they call <i>zampa</i>, in the
language of the people of the hill country. Wherever they apprehended
that a rope bridge might be constructed, they stationed musketeers and
archers and men-at-arms, and so felt secure. Dil&#257;war K. made rafts
(<i>jh&#257;la</i>), and, placing on them eighty of his valiant young
men, sent them across the river at night. As the water was flowing with
great violence, the rafts were carried down by the flood of
destruction, and sixty-eight of these gallant men were drowned in the
sea of non-existence, and obtained the renown of martyrdom, whilst ten,
by the aid of swimming, reached the shore of safety (<i>i.e.</i>,
returned), and two on the other side became prisoners in the hands of
the infidels. In short, for four months and ten days Dil&#257;war
K&#863;h&#257;n, having planted the foot of courage at
Bhandarko&#8411;, made endeavours to cross over; but the arrow of
stratagem did not reach the target of intent until a Zamindar pointed
out a place which the enemy had no idea of. There, having constructed a
<i>zampah</i>, in the heart of night, Jal&#257;l, Dil&#257;war
K.&rsquo;s son, with some of the servants of the Court and a band of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb138" href="#v2pb138" name=
"v2pb138">138</a>]</span>Afghans, about 200 in number, crossed over in
safety, made unawares in the morning an attack on the Raja, and blew
loudly the trumpets of victory. A few who were around and before the
Raja rushed out, bewildered, half asleep and half awake, and most of
them became the harvest of the blood-drinking sword, while the rest
quickly withdrew themselves from that whirlpool of calamity. In that
encounter one of the soldiers came upon the Raja, and wished to finish
him with a sword. He called out: &ldquo;I am the Raja; take me alive to
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n.&rdquo; The men rushed on him and made him
prisoner. After the Raja was made prisoner, his people all fled. When
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n heard this good news of victory, he
prostrated himself in thankfulness to Allah, and, having crossed the
river with the victorious army, came to Mandal Badr,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e13066src" href="#xd24e13066" name="xd24e13066src">21</a> which
was the capital of the country, and is 3 koss from the river. The
daughter<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13069src" href="#xd24e13069" name=
"xd24e13069src">22</a> of Sangr&#257;m Raja of Jammu, and the daughter
of the abandoned S&#363;raj Mal, s. R&#257;ja B&#257;so, were in the
Raja&rsquo;s house (<i>i.e.</i>, married to him). By
Sangr&#257;m&rsquo;s daughter he had children. Before the victory he
had, by way of caution, sent his family for refuge to the Raja of
Jasw&#257;l and other Zamindars. When my victorious retinue approached,
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n, according to order, took the Raja with
him, and came to kiss the threshold, leaving Na&#7779;ru-llah
&#703;Arab with a body of horse and foot to guard the country.</p>
<p class="par">In Kis&#863;htw&#257;r there are produced much wheat,
barley, lentils, millet, and pulse. Differing from Kashmir, it produces
little rice. Its saffron is finer than that of Kashmir. About a hundred
hawks and falcons are caught there (annually). Oranges, citrons, and
water-melons of the finest kind are obtained. Its melons are of the
same kind as those of Kashmir, and other fruits, such as grapes,
apricots, peaches, and sour pears, are grown. If they were cultivated,
it is possible they would improve. A coin<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e13077src" href="#xd24e13077" name="xd24e13077src">23</a> of the
name of <i>sanhas&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e13084src" href=
"#xd24e13084" name="xd24e13084src">24</a> is a relic of the old rulers
of Kashmir, one and a half of which <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb139" href="#v2pb139" name="v2pb139">139</a>]</span>equal a rupee.
In their business transactions they reckon fifteen <i>sanhas&#299;</i>,
or ten rupees, as one <i>p&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h&#299;</i> muhar. They
call two seers of Hindustani weight a <i>man</i> (maund). It is not the
custom for the Raja to take revenue from cultivation; he takes annually
six <i>sanhas&#299;</i>&mdash;that is, four rupees&mdash;from each
house. All the saffron is assigned, as pay, to a body of Rajputs and to
700 musketeers (<i>t&#363;pch&#299;</i>) who are old retainers. When
the saffron is sold, four rupees per maund, or two seers, are taken
from the purchaser. The whole income of the Raja consists of fines, and
for a small offence he takes a heavy sum. From whomsoever is wealthy
and in comfortable circumstances the Raja, on some pretext, clears out
all that he has. From all sources his income is about Rs. 100,000. In
time of war 6,000 or 7,000 men on foot collect together; there are but
few horses among them. The Raja and the chief men have about fifty
between them. I bestowed a year&rsquo;s revenue on Dil&#257;war K. by
way of reward. By conjecture, his jagir was worth about 1,000 personal
and 1,000 horse, according to the <i>Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299;</i>
rules. When the chief diwans calculate the allowances to the jagirdars,
the exact amount will be ascertained.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 11th, after two watches and four gharis
had passed, the royal cortege alighted auspiciously and happily at the
buildings lately erected on the bank of the lake (the Dal lake). By
order of my father, a very strong fort of stone and lime had been
built. It is not quite completed, one side being unfinished. It is
hoped that hereafter it will be completed. From H&#803;asan Abd&#257;l
to Kashmir by the road I came is a distance of 75 koss; this was
accomplished in nineteen marches and six halts&mdash;that is, in
twenty-five days. From Agra to Kashmir, in the space of 168 days, a
distance of 376 koss was traversed in 102 marches and 63 halts. By
land<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13116src" href="#xd24e13116" name=
"xd24e13116src">25</a> and the ordinary route the distance is
304&frac12; koss.</p>
<p class="par">On Tuesday, the 12th, Dil&#257;war K., according to
order, brought the Raja<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13121src" href=
"#xd24e13121" name="xd24e13121src">26</a> of Kis&#863;htw&#257;r,
chained, into my presence, and did homage. He (the Raja) is not wanting
in dignity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb140" href="#v2pb140"
name="v2pb140">140</a>]</span>His dress is after the Indian fashion,
and he knows both the Hindi and the Kashmiri languages. Contrary to
other Zamindars of these regions, he looked like the inhabitant of a
town. I told him that, notwithstanding his offences, if he would bring
his sons to Court, he should be released from confinement, and might
live at ease under the shadow of the eternal State, or else he would be
imprisoned in one of the forts of Hindustan. He said that he would
bring his people, his family, and his sons to wait on me, and was
hopeful of my clemency.</p>
<p class="par">I shall now give a brief account of the country of
Kashmir and of its peculiarities.</p>
<p class="par">Kashmir<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13131src" href=
"#xd24e13131" name="xd24e13131src">27</a> belongs to the fourth
climate. Its latitude is 35&deg; N., and its longitude, from the White
Islands, 105&deg;. In old times the country was in the possession of
Rajas. Their dynasty lasted for 4,000 years. An account of them, and a
list of their names, are given in the R&#257;ja-tarang, which, by my
father&rsquo;s order, was translated<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e13146src" href="#xd24e13146" name="xd24e13146src">28</a> from the
Sanskrit (Hindi in text) into Persian. In the Hijri year 712
(1312&ndash;13) Kashmir was illumined by the religion of Islam.
Thirty-two Muhammadan princes reigned over it for 282 years, until, in
994 (1586), my father conquered it. From that date till now, being a
period of thirty-five years, the country has been in the possession of
the Crown. Kashmir, from the Pass of B&#363;l&#299;y&#257;sa<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e13149src" href="#xd24e13149" name=
"xd24e13149src">29</a> to Qambarbar, is 56
<i>Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299;</i> koss long, and its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb141" href="#v2pb141" name=
"v2pb141">141</a>]</span>breadth is never more than 27 koss, or less
than 10 koss. S&#863;haik&#863;h Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l has, in the
Akbar-n&#257;ma, stated, by guess and conjecture, that the length of
Kashmir from the Kis&#863;han Gang&#257; to Qambarbar is 120 koss, and
its breadth from 10 to 25 koss. I, out of prudence and caution,
appointed a number of trustworthy and intelligent men to measure the
length and breadth with ropes (<i>t&#804;an&#257;b)</i>. The result was
that what the Shaikh wrote as 120 koss came out as 67. As it is agreed
that the boundary of a country is the place up to which people speak
the language of that country, it follows that the boundary of Kashmir
is B&#363;l&#299;y&#257;sa, which is 11 koss on this side (<i>i.e.</i>,
east) of the Kis&#863;han Gang&#257;. So, according to the preceding
figures, the length of Kashmir is 56 (67 - 11) koss. The variations in
breadth were found to be not more than 2 koss. The koss<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e13166src" href="#xd24e13166" name=
"xd24e13166src">30</a> which is in use during my reign is that
prescribed by my father. That is, a koss is 5,000 yards, and the yard
is 2 <i>s&#863;har&#703;&#299;</i> yards, each of the latter (yards)
being 24 digits<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13219src" href="#xd24e13219"
name="xd24e13219src">31</a> (<i>angus&#863;ht&#804;</i>). Wherever the
koss or <i>gaz</i> is mentioned, the reference is to the above koss and
the above <i>gaz</i>. The name of the city is Sr&#299;nagar, and the
Bihat river flows <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb142" href=
"#v2pb142" name="v2pb142">142</a>]</span>through the midst of it. They
call its fountain-head V&#299;r-n&#257;g.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e13237src" href="#xd24e13237" name="xd24e13237src">32</a> It is 14
koss to the south. By my order they have made a building and a garden
at that source. There have been built in the city four very strong
stone and wooden bridges, over which people come and go. They call a
bridge in the language of this country <i>kadal</i>. There is a very
lofty mosque in the city, one of the marks of Sult&#804;&#257;n
Sikandar,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13243src" href="#xd24e13243" name=
"xd24e13243src">33</a> made in 795 (1393). After a time it was burnt,
but was rebuilt by Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain. It had not been
completed when the mansion of his life fell down. In 909
(1503&ndash;04) Ibr&#257;h&#299;m M&#257;qr&#299;, Vizier of
Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain, finished it handsomely. From that day
till now it is 120 years since it has been in existence. From the
<i>Mih&#803;r&#257;b</i> to the eastern wall it is 145 yards, and its
breadth is 144 yards, containing four (<i>t&#804;&#257;q</i>) alcoves.
On all sides of the hall they have erected beautiful cloisters and
pillars. In short, no better memorial of the rulers of Kashmir has been
left than this. Mir Sayyid &#703;Al&#299; of Hamadan (may his grave be
sanctified!) was for some time in this city. There is a
monastery<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13256src" href="#xd24e13256" name=
"xd24e13256src">34</a> to his memory. Near the city there are
two<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13261src" href="#xd24e13261" name=
"xd24e13261src">35</a> large lakes full of water all the year round.
Their flavour<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13267src" href="#xd24e13267"
name="xd24e13267src">36</a> does not vary; they are the means for
coming and going of the people, and for the conveyance of grain and
firewood on boats. In the city and parganas there are 5,700 boats, with
7,400<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13273src" href="#xd24e13273" name=
"xd24e13273src">37</a> boatmen. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb143"
href="#v2pb143" name="v2pb143">143</a>]</span>The country of Kashmir
has thirty-eight parganas. It is divided into two provinces; the
territory on the upper part of the river they call <i>Marr&#257;j</i>,
and that on the lower <i>K&#257;mr&#257;j</i>. It is not the custom to
use gold and silver for payment of the revenue from land or in
commerce, except for a portion of the cesses
(<i>s&#257;&#702;ir-jih&#257;t</i>).<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e13299src" href="#xd24e13299" name="xd24e13299src">38</a> They
reckon the value of things in <i>k&#863;harw&#257;rs</i> of rice, each
<i>k&#863;harw&#257;r</i> being three maunds and eight seers of the
current weight. The Kashmiris reckon two seers as one maund, and four
maunds, or eight seers, make one <i>tark</i>. The revenue of Kashmir is
30,63,050 <i>kharw&#257;rs</i> and 11 <i>tarks</i>, which in cash
represents 7,46,70,000 <i>d&#257;ms</i>. Ordinarily it maintains 8,500
horse. It is very difficult to enter Kashmir. The routes by
Bhimbhar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13321src" href="#xd24e13321" name=
"xd24e13321src">39</a> and Pakl&#299; are the best. Though that by
Bhimbhar is the shorter, yet if one wishes to find spring in Kashmir,
he is confined to the road by Pakl&#299;, for the other roads at this
season are blocked with snow. If one were to take to praise Kashmir,
whole books would have to be written. Accordingly a mere summary will
be recorded.</p>
<p class="par">Kashmir is a garden<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13326src"
href="#xd24e13326" name="xd24e13326src">40</a> of eternal spring, or an
iron fort to a palace of kings&mdash;a delightful flower-bed, and a
heart-expanding heritage for dervishes. Its pleasant meads and
enchanting cascades are beyond all description. There are running
streams and fountains beyond count. Wherever the eye reaches, there are
verdure and running water. The red rose, the violet, and the narcissus
grow of themselves; in the fields, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb144" href="#v2pb144" name="v2pb144">144</a>]</span>there are all
kinds of flowers and all sorts of sweet-scented herbs more than can be
calculated. In the soul-enchanting spring the hills and plains are
filled with blossoms; the gates, the walls, the courts, the roofs, are
lighted up by the torches of banquet-adorning tulips. What shall we say
of these things or of the wide meadows (<i>julgah&#257;</i>) and the
fragrant trefoil?</p>

<p class="par first">The finest inflorescence is that of the almond and
the peach. Outside the hill-country the commencement of blossoming is
the 1st Isfand&#257;rmuz (February 10). In the territory of Kashmir it
is 1st Farward&#299;n (March 10), and in the city gardens it is the 9th
and 10th of that month, and the end of their blooming joins on to the
commencement of that of the blue jessamine. In attendance on my revered
father I frequently went round the saffron fields, and beheld the
spectacle of the autumn. Thank God that on this occasion I beheld the
beauties<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13368src" href="#xd24e13368" name=
"xd24e13368src">42</a> of the spring. The beauties of the autumn shall
be described in their place. The buildings of Kashmir are all of wood;
they make them two-, three-, and four-storied, and covering the roofs
with earth, they plant bulbs of the
<i>chaug&#863;h&#257;s&#863;h&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e13379src" href="#xd24e13379" name="xd24e13379src">43</a> tulip,
which blooms year after year <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb145"
href="#v2pb145" name="v2pb145">145</a>]</span>in the spring season, and
is exceedingly beautiful. This custom is peculiar to the people of
Kashmir. This year, in the little garden<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e13390src" href="#xd24e13390" name="xd24e13390src">44</a> of the
palace and on the roof of the chief mosque, the tulips blossomed
luxuriantly. There are many blue jessamines in the gardens, and the
white jessamines that the people of India call
<i>chamb&#299;l&#299;</i> are sweet-scented. Another kind is of the
colour of sandal-wood, and this is also very sweet-scented. This is
special to Kashmir. I saw several sorts of red roses: one is specially
sweet-scented, and another is a flower of the colour of sandal (light
yellow), with an exceedingly delicate scent. It (the scent?) is of the
nature of (that of) the red rose, and its stem is like that of the red
rose. There are two kinds of lilies. That which is grown in gardens is
vigorous <i>(b&#257;l&#299;da)</i> and fresh (lit. green) coloured, the
other is a wild kind. Although the latter has less colour it is very
sweet-scented. The flower of the <i>Ja&#703;far&#299;</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e13405src" href="#xd24e13405" name=
"xd24e13405src">45</a> (a yellow flower) is large and sweet-scented;
its stem is above a man&rsquo;s height, but in some years, when it has
grown large and has flowered, a worm is produced, and spreads over the
flower a kind of spider&rsquo;s web, and destroys it and dries up its
stem. This year it has so happened. The flowers that are seen in the
territories of Kashmir are beyond all calculation. Those that

fruit-bearing trees. There were also some apricot-trees. The aforesaid

fact, the apricot<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13423src" href=
"#xd24e13423" name="xd24e13423src">49</a> of Kashmir is good.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb146" href="#v2pb146" name=
"v2pb146">146</a>]</span>There was a tree in the
S&#863;hahr-&#257;r&#257; garden at Kabul, called
<i>M&#299;rz&#257;&#702;&#299;</i>, better fruit than which I had not
eaten, but in Kashmir there are trees equal to this in the gardens.
There are pears (<i>n&#257;s&#863;hp&#257;t&#299;</i>) of the best
kind, better than those of Kabul, or Badakhshan, and nearly equal to
those of Samarkand. The apples of Kashmir are celebrated for their
goodness. The guavas (<i>amr&#363;d</i>) are middling. Grapes are
plentiful, but most of them are harsh and inferior, and the
pomegranates are not worth much. Water-melons of the best kind can be
obtained. The melons are very sweet and creased, (?
<i>s&#863;hikananda</i>)<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13441src" href=
"#xd24e13441" name="xd24e13441src">50</a>, but for the most part when
they become ripe a worm is found in them that spoils them. If by chance
they are preserved from this misfortune they are very delicate. There
are no <i>s&#863;h&#257;h-t&#363;t</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e13448src" href="#xd24e13448" name="xd24e13448src">51</a> (some
kind of large mulberry), but there are other (<i>t&#363;t</i>)
mulberries everywhere. From the foot of every mulberry-tree a
vine-creeper grows<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13454src" href=
"#xd24e13454" name="xd24e13454src">52</a> up. In fact, the mulberries
of Kashmir are not fit to eat, with the exception of some on trees
grown in gardens, but the leaves are used to feed the silkworm. They
bring the silkworms&rsquo; eggs from Gilgit and Tibet. There is plenty
of wine and vinegar, but the wine is sour and inferior, and in the
Kashmir language is called <i>mas</i>. After they take cups of it some
heat of head ensues. They make various pickles with the vinegar. As the
garlic of Kashmir is good, the best pickle is that of garlic. There are
all kinds of crops except peas. If they sow peas, they give a crop the
first year, in the second they are inferior, and in the third year they
are like <i>mus&#863;hang</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13464src"
href="#xd24e13464" name="xd24e13464src">53</a> Rice is the principal
crop. Probably there are three parts under rice and one under all other
grains. The chief food of the people of Kashmir is rice, but it is
inferior. They boil it fresh,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13472src"
href="#xd24e13472" name="xd24e13472src">54</a> and allow it to get
cold, and then eat it, and call it <i>batha</i>. It is not usual to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb147" href="#v2pb147" name=
"v2pb147">147</a>]</span>take their food warm, but people of small
means keep a portion of the <i>batha</i> for a night, and eat it next
day. Salt is brought from India. It is not the custom to put salt into
the <i>batha</i>. They boil vegetables in water, and throw in a little
salt in order to alter the flavour, and then eat them along with the
<i>batha</i>. Those who want to have something tasty put a little
walnut-oil into the vegetables. Walnut-oil soon becomes bitter and
evil-flavoured. They also use cow-oil
(<i>raug&#863;han</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, <i>ghi</i>), but this is taken
fresh, and fresh from newly-made butter (<i>maska</i>). They throw this
into the food, and call it &ldquo;sad&#257;-p&#257;k&rdquo; in the
Kashmiri language. As the atmosphere is cold and damp, it becomes
altered by being kept for three or four days. There are no buffaloes,
and the cattle are small and inferior. The wheat<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e13512src" href="#xd24e13512" name="xd24e13512src">55</a> is small
and of little substance (<i>kam mag&#863;hz</i>). It is not the custom
to eat bread (<i>n&#257;n</i>). There are tailless sheep, resembling
the <i>kad&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e13523src" href=
"#xd24e13523" name="xd24e13523src">56</a> (or <i>gadd&#299;</i>) of
India. They are called <i>hand&#363;</i>, and their flesh is not
without flavour. Fowls, geese, and ducks
(<i>murg&#863;h&#257;b&#299;</i>)&mdash;golden and others&mdash;are
plentiful. There are all kinds of fish, both with and without scales,
but they are inferior. The woollen cloths are well known. Men and women
wear a woollen tunic (<i>kurt&#257;</i>), and call it
<i>pa&#7789;&#7789;&#363;</i>. If they do not put on a tunic, they
believe that the air affects them, and even that it is impossible to
digest their food without it. The shawls of Kashmir, to which my father
gave the name of <i>parm-narm</i>, are very famous: there is no need to
praise them. Another kind is <i>taharma</i> (<i>naharma</i> in the
printed version); it is thicker than a shawl, and soft.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e13583src" href="#xd24e13583" name=
"xd24e13583src">57</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb148" href=
"#v2pb148" name="v2pb148">148</a>]</span>Another is called
<i>darma</i>. It is like a <i>jul-i-k&#863;hirsak</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e13604src" href="#xd24e13604" name=
"xd24e13604src">58</a> and is put over carpets. With the exception of
shawls they make other woollen materials better in Tibet. Though they
bring the wool for the shawls from Tibet they do not make them there.
The wool for shawls comes from a goat which is peculiar to Tibet. In
Kashmir they weave the <i>pa&#7789;&#7789;&#363;</i> shawl from wool,
and sewing two shawls together they smooth them into a kind of
<i>saqarl&#257;t</i> (broad-cloth), which is not bad for a rain-coat.
The men of Kashmir shave the head and put on a round turban, and the
common women do not wear clean, washed clothes. They use a tunic of
<i>pa&#7789;&#7789;&#363;</i> for three or four years; they bring it
unwashed from the house of the weaver, and sew it into a tunic, and it
does not reach the water till it falls to pieces. It is considered
wrong to wear drawers (<i>iz&#257;r</i>); they wear the tunic long and
ample as far as the head and falling down to the feet, and they also
wear<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13627src" href="#xd24e13627" name=
"xd24e13627src">59</a> a belt. Although most of the houses are on the
river-bank not a drop of water touches their bodies. In short, they are
as dirty outside as inside, without any cleanliness. In the time of
M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;aidar there were many skilled people there. They
were skilled in music, and their lutes, dulcimers, harps, drums, and
flutes were celebrated. In former times they had a musical instrument
like a lute, and used to sing in the Kashmir&#299; language
compositions according to Hindi musical modes, there being even two or
three modes combined together. Moreover, many sing together in chorus.
In fact, Kashmir is much indebted to M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;aidar for
its excellencies. Before the reign of my father the chief method by
which the people of these parts rode was on <i>g&#363;nts</i> (ponies).
They had no large horses, but used to bring &#703;Ir&#257;q and Turki
horses by way of rare gifts for their rulers. <i>G&#363;nt</i> means a
<i>y&#257;b&#363;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e13639src" href=
"#xd24e13639" name="xd24e13639src">60</a> (pony). <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb149" href="#v2pb149" name=
"v2pb149">149</a>]</span>They have thick shoulders, and are low in the
body. They are common in other of the hill-countries of India. For the
most part they are vicious<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13668src" href=
"#xd24e13668" name="xd24e13668src">61</a> and hard-mouthed. When this
God-created flower-garden acquired eternal beauty under the auspices of
the State, and by the blessing of the teaching of the Alexander-minded
K&#863;h&#257;q&#257;n, many of the Aim&#257;qs (cavalry) were
presented with jagirs in this Subah, and herds of &#703;Ir&#257;q&#299;
and Turk&#299; horses were given them to breed from (<i>kih kurra
bag&#299;rand</i>). The soldiers also brought horses<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e13686src" href="#xd24e13686" name="xd24e13686src">62</a> on
their own account, and in a short time horses were obtainable, so that
many Kashmiri horses were bought and sold for 200 and Rs. 300, and even
for Rs. 1,000.</p>
<p class="par">The merchants and artificers of this country are mostly
Sunnis, while the soldiers are Im&#257;miyya Shias. There is also the
sect of N&#363;r-bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;s.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e13706src" href="#xd24e13706" name="xd24e13706src">63</a> There is

they eat no flesh, they have no wives, and always plant fruit-bearing
trees in the fields, so that men may benefit by them, themselves
deriving no advantage. There are about 2,000 of these people. There is
also a body of brahmans living from of old in this country, who still
remain there and talk in the Kashmiri tongue. Outwardly one cannot
distinguish them from Mussulmans. They have, however, books in the
Sanskrit language, and read them. They carry into practice whatever
relates to the worship of idols. Sanskrit is a language in which the
learned of India have composed books, and esteem them greatly. The
lofty idol temples which were built before the manifestation of Islam
are still in existence, and are all built of stones, which from
foundation to roof are large, and weigh 30 or 40 maunds, placed one on
the other. Near the city there is a small hill which they call
K&#363;h-i-M&#257;r&#257;n<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13720src" href=
"#xd24e13720" name="xd24e13720src">65</a> (&ldquo;The Wicked
Hill,&rdquo; Lawrence, 298), as well as Har&#299; Parbat. On the east
side of the hill there is the Dal Lake, which measures round a little
more than 6&frac12; koss.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13727src" href=
"#xd24e13727" name="xd24e13727src">66</a> My father (may the lights of
Allah be his testimony!) gave an order that they should build in this
place a very strong fort of stone and lime; this has been nearly
completed during the reign of this suppliant, so that the little hill
has been brought into the midst of the fortifications, and the wall of
the fort built round it. The lake is close to the fort, and the palace
overlooks the water. In the palace there was a little garden, with a
small building in it in which my revered father used constantly to sit.
At this period it appeared to me to be very much out of order and
ruinous. As it was the place where that veritable <i>qibla</i> (place
turned towards in prayer) and visible Deity used to sit, and it is
really a place of prostration for this suppliant, therefore its
neglected state did not appear right to me. I ordered Mu&#703;tamid K.,
who is a servant who knows my temperament, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb151" href="#v2pb151" name=
"v2pb151">151</a>]</span>to make every effort to put the little garden
in order and repair the buildings. In a short space of time, through
his great assiduity, it acquired new beauty. In the garden he put up a
lofty terrace 32 yards square, in three divisions
(<i>qit&#804;&#702;a</i>), and having repaired the building he adorned
it with pictures by masterhands, and so made it the envy of the picture
gallery of China. I called this garden <i>N&#363;r-afz&#257;</i> (light
increasing).</p>
<p class="par">On Friday, the 15th of the Divine month of
Farward&#299;n, two <i>qut&#804;&#257;s</i> oxen, out of the offerings
of the Zamindar of Tibet, were brought before me. In form and
appearance they closely resemble the buffalo. All the limbs are covered
with wool which properly belongs to animals in a cold country. For
instance, the <i>rang</i> goats (ibex), which they brought from the
country of Bhakkar (Sind) and the hill-country of the Garms&#299;r (in
Afghanistan) were very handsome, and had but little wool, and those
that are met with in these hills, on account of the excessive cold and
snow, are covered with hair and ugly. The Kashmiris call the rang
<i>kapal</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13752src" href="#xd24e13752"
name="xd24e13752src">67</a> On this day they brought a musk deer as an
offering. As I had not tasted its flesh, I ordered it to be cooked; it
appeared very tasteless and bad for food. The flesh of no other wild
animal is so inferior. The musk-bag when fresh has no scent, but when
it is left for some days and becomes dry, it is sweet-scented. The
female has no musk-bag. In these two or three days I frequently
embarked in a boat, and was delighted to go<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e13761src" href="#xd24e13761" name="xd24e13761src">68</a> round
and look at the flowers of Ph&#257;k and S&#863;h&#257;lam&#257;r.
Ph&#257;k is the name of a pargana situated on the other side of the
lake. S&#863;h&#257;lam&#257;r is near the lake. It has a pleasant
stream, which comes down from the hills, and flows into the Dal Lake. I
bade my son K&#863;hurram dam it up and make a waterfall, which it
would be a pleasure to behold. This place is one of the sights of
Kashmir.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 17th, a strange affair took place.
S&#863;h&#257;h S&#863;huj&#257;&#703; was playing in the buildings of
the palace. By chance there was a window with a screen in front of it
looking towards <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb152" href="#v2pb152"
name="v2pb152">152</a>]</span>the river. They had put a screen in
front, but had not fastened the door, and the prince in play went
towards the window to look out. As soon as he arrived there he fell
headlong. By chance they had laid down a carpet below the wall, and a
farr&#257;s&#863;h (carpet-spreader) was sitting near it. The
child&rsquo;s head fell on this carpet, and his feet on the back and
shoulders of the farr&#257;s&#863;h, and so came to the ground. Though
the height was 7 yards<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13768src" href=
"#xd24e13768" name="xd24e13768src">69</a> (<i>dara&#703;</i>), the
compassion of God, the Great and Glorious, came to his aid, and the
carpet and the farr&#257;s&#863;h became the means of saving his life.
God forbid, but if it had not been so it would have been a serious
matter for him. At the time R&#257;y M&#257;n, the head of the
K&#863;hidmatiyya<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13777src" href=
"#xd24e13777" name="xd24e13777src">70</a> piy&#257;das, was standing
below the <i>jharoka</i>. He immediately ran and picked him up, and
holding him in his arms, was taking him upstairs. In that condition he
asked: &ldquo;Whither are you carrying me?&rdquo; He replied:
&ldquo;Into the presence of His Majesty.&rdquo; Then weakness overcame
him, and he could speak no more. I was lying down when this alarming
news reached me, and ran out in a state of bewilderment. When I saw him
in this state my senses forsook me, and for a long time holding him in
my affectionate embrace I was distracted with this favour from Allah.
When a child of four years of age falls headlong from a place ten
ordinary (<i>s&#863;har&#703;&#299;</i>) gaz in height, and no harm
happens to his limbs, it is a cause for amazement. Having performed my
prostrations for this fresh act of goodness, I distributed alms, and
ordered that deserving people and the poor who lived in the city should
be brought before me in order that I might assure them their means of
livelihood. A strange thing was that three or four months before this
event Jotik R&#257;y, the astrologer, who is one of the most skilled of
the class in astrology, had represented to me, without any
intermediary, that it was predicted from the Prince&rsquo;s horoscope
that these three or four months were unpropitious to him, and it was
possible he might fall down from some high place, but that the dust of
calamity would not settle on the skirt of his life. As his
prognostications had repeatedly proved correct, this dread dwelt in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb153" href="#v2pb153" name=
"v2pb153">153</a>]</span>my mind, and on these dangerous roads and
difficult mountain passes I was never for a moment forgetful of that
nursling of the <i>parterre</i> of Fortune. I continually kept him in
sight, and took the greatest precautions with regard to him. When I
arrived in Kashmir this unavoidable<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e13792src" href="#xd24e13792" name="xd24e13792src">71</a>
catastrophe occurred. His nurses (<i>anagah&#257;</i>) and wet-nurses
must have been very careless. God be praised that it ended well!</p>
<p class="par">In the garden of &#703;Ais&#863;h&#257;b&#257;d<a class=

K&#257;kar, I promoted him to the mansab of 4,000 personal and 3,000

Far&#299;d, s. Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K. was raised to the mansab of
1,000 personal and 400 horse. The mansab of Sar-bar&#257;h K. was
ordered to be 700 personal and 250 horse, and I promoted N&#363;ru-llah
Kurk&#299;r&#257;q (in charge of furriery?) to that of 600 personal and
100 horse, bestowing on him the title of Tas&#863;hr&#299;f K. The
offerings of Thursday, the 21st, were handed over as a reward to
Qiy&#257;m K., the chief huntsman. As Allah-d&#257;d Afghan, s. the

pardoned his offences; the signs of disgrace and shame were evident on
his forehead and, according to the previous arrangement, I bestowed on
him the mansab of 2,500 and 200 horse. M&#299;rak Jal&#257;yir, one of
the auxiliaries of Bengal, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal

afterwards continued to his rebel son S&#363;raj Mal, were now bestowed
on Jagat Singh, his brother, who had not obtained the <i>t&#299;ka</i>
(mark of royal succession), and I gave the pargana of Jamm&#363; to
R&#257;ja Sangr&#257;m. On Monday, the 1st of Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, I
went to the house of K&#863;hurram, and entered his bath-house, and
when I came out he presented his offerings. Of these I accepted a
trifle in order to please him. On Thursday, the 4th, M&#299;r Jumla was
promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 300 horse. On Sunday, the

the native country of H&#803;aidar Malik, to hunt partridges. In truth
this is a very pleasant spot of ground, and has flowing streams and
lofty plane-trees. At his request I gave it the name of
N&#363;rp&#363;r<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13839src" href=
"#xd24e13839" name="xd24e13839src">77</a> (city of light). On the road
there was a tree<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13842src" href=
"#xd24e13842" name="xd24e13842src">78</a> called <i>halthal</i>; when
one takes one of the branches and shakes it, the whole of the tree
comes into movement. The common people believe that this movement is
peculiar to that tree. By chance in the said village I saw another tree
of the same kind, which was in similar movement, and I ascertained that
it was common to that species of tree, and not confined to one tree. In
the village of R&#257;walp&#363;r, 2&frac12; koss from the city towards
Hindustan, there is a plane-tree, burnt in the inside. Twenty-five
years before this, when I myself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb155"

with five other saddled horses and two eunuchs, we went inside it.
Whenever I had chanced to mention this people were surprised. This time
I again ordered some of the men to go inside, and what I had in my mind
came to pass in the same manner. It has been noted in the
Akbar-n&#257;ma that my father took<a class="noteref" id=

Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#299;, faujd&#257;r of Bhakkar, raised his head of
honour with the Subadarship of Sind, and his mansab, original and
increased, was fixed at 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, and he was also
presented with a standard. S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K. &#703;Arab
obtained the honour of exaltation to the mansab of 2,500 personal and
2,000 horse. An&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299; Singh-dalan, at the request of
Mah&#257;bat K., was appointed to Bangash. J&#257;n-sip&#257;r K. was
promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse.</p>
<p class="par">At this time, on the representation of the
Commander-in-Chief, K&#863;h&#257;n-K&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, and all the
loyal people, it was shown to me that &#703;Ambar, the black-fated one
(he was an Abyssinian), had again placed his foot beyond the bounds of
good behaviour, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb156" href="#v2pb156"
name="v2pb156">156</a>]</span>and had, according to his nature, laid a
foundation for trouble and sedition, and as the victorious army had
proceeded to a distant part of the country, he, considering it a good
opportunity, had broken the pledges he had given to the servants of the
Court, and had stretched out his hand to take possession of royal
territory. It is hoped that he will soon be entangled in the disgrace
of his deeds. As he (the Commander-in-Chief) had asked for treasure, it
was ordered that the diwans of Agra should send Rs. 20,00,000 to the
Commander-in-Chief. Close upon this news came that the Amirs had left
their posts, and come together to D&#257;r&#257;b K., and that the
<i>Barg&#299;s</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e13875src" href=
"#xd24e13875" name="xd24e13875src">81</a> (the Mahrattas) were
surrounding his camp, and that K&#863;hanjar K. had taken refuge in
Ah&#803;madnagar. Two or three battles had already taken place between
the rebels and the servants of the Court, and each time the enemy had
been defeated, and many of them killed. On the last occasion
D&#257;r&#257;b K., taking with him well-mounted young men, attacked
the rebels&rsquo; camp. A fierce battle ensued, and the enemy being
defeated turned the face of ruin towards the valley of flight. Their
camp had been plundered, and the victorious army had returned in safety
to their camp. As difficulty and distress had fallen on the victorious
army, those who were loyal came to the conclusion that they should go
down by the Pass of Rohanga&#7771;h<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e13878src" href="#xd24e13878" name="xd24e13878src">82</a> and
remain below the <i>gh&#257;t</i>, so that forage and grain might be
easily obtained, and the men not incur any labour or distress. Having
no choice, they prepared the army of prosperity at
B&#257;l&#257;p&#363;r, and the rebels of black fortune, with
impertinence and importunity, appeared near B&#257;l&#257;p&#363;r.
R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo, with some of the devoted servants,
plucking up courage in order to beat back the enemy, slew many of them.
An Abyssinian of the name of Man&#7779;&#363;r, who was in the rebel
army, fell into their hands, and although they wished to put him on an
elephant (see Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma 161, the text wrongly has
<i>z&#299;r</i> &ldquo;under&rdquo;), he would not agree, and was
insolent.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13888src" href="#xd24e13888" name=

separate his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb157" href="#v2pb157"

<p class="par">On the 3rd Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht I rode to see the Sukh

(&#299;l&#257;q). This waterfall is in the midst of a valley, and flows
down from a lofty place. There was still ice on its sides. The
entertainment of Thursday was arranged for in that flower-land, and I
was delighted at drinking my usual cups on the edge of the water. In
this stream I saw a bird like a <i>s&#257;j</i>.<a class="noteref" id=

bird is of the same colour as a <i>bulbul</i> with white spots, and it
dives and remains for a long time underneath, and then comes up from a
different place. I ordered them to catch and bring two or three of
these birds, that I might ascertain whether they were waterfowl and
were web-footed, or had open feet like land birds. They caught two and
brought them. One died immediately, and the other lived for a day. Its
feet were not webbed like a duck&rsquo;s. I ordered
N&#257;diru-l-&#703;a&#7779;r Ust&#257;d Man&#7779;&#363;r to draw its
likeness. The Kashmiris call it <i>galkar</i><a class="noteref" id=

to me that &#703;Abdu-l-Wahh&#257;b, the son of H&#803;ak&#299;m

produced a bond with the seal of Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; N&#363;ru-llah.

whatever was right by the Divine Law. The next day Mu&#703;tamid
K&#863;h&#257;n represented that the Sayyids showed great humility and
submissiveness. The matter was a complicated<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e13946src" href="#xd24e13946" name="xd24e13946src">89</a> one. The
greater reflection shown in ascertaining the truth in the matter the
better. I accordingly ordered that &#256;&#7779;af K. should take
exceeding trouble and forethought in ascertaining the truth of this
quarrel, and point out such a way (of unravelling it) that no doubt
whatever should remain. With all this, if it could not be cleared up, I
would examine them in my own presence. Immediately he heard these
words, the H&#803;ak&#299;m&rsquo;s son lost both his hands and his
heart in the affair, and made a number of his friends intercessors, and
proposed a withdrawal. His representation was that if the Sayyids would
not<a class="noteref" id="xd24e13951src" href="#xd24e13951" name=
"xd24e13951src">90</a> refer the matter to &#256;&#7779;af K. he would
give a release, and that hereafter he would have no right against nor
claim from them. Whenever &#256;&#7779;af K. sent to fetch him, as he
was a low deceiver, he passed his time in making excuses, and did not
appear until he handed over the deed of release to one of his friends,
and the true state of affairs became evident to &#256;&#7779;af K. They
brought him by force into the place of examination, and, having no
choice, he confessed that the deed had been prepared by one of his
servants, who himself witnessed it, and had misled him. He gave a
writing to this effect. When &#256;&#7779;af K. informed me of the real
state of matters, I took away his mansab and jagir, and cast him out of
my presence, and gave the Sayyids leave to return to Lahore in all
honour and respect. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb159" href=

<p class="par">In Kashmir the most juicy(?) fruit is the
<i>as&#863;hkan</i>(?) (<i>askam&#299;</i> in the MSS.). It is subacid
(<i>mai-k&#863;h&#363;s&#863;h</i>), smaller than the <i>&#257;l&#363;
b&#257;l&#363;</i> (sour cherry), much better flavoured, and more
delicate. When drinking wine, one cannot eat more than three or four
<i>&#257;l&#363; b&#257;l&#363;</i>, but of these one can take as many
as a hundred in twenty-four hours, especially of the
<i>paiwand&#299;</i>(?) sort. I ordered that the <i>as&#863;hkan</i>
should hereafter be called the <i>k&#863;h&#363;s&#863;hkan</i>. It
grows in the hills of Badakhshan and in Khurasan; the people there call
it <i>jamdam&#299;</i>. The largest of them weigh &frac12;
<i>mis&#804;q&#257;l</i>. The <i>s&#863;h&#257;h-&#257;l&#363;</i>
(cherry), on the 4th Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, appeared of the size of a
grain of pulse; on the 27th it reddened, and on the 15th
K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d it was ripe, and new fruit (<i>nau-bar</i>) had
formed(?). The <i>s&#863;h&#257;h-&#257;l&#363;</i> (cherry), to my
taste, is better than most fruits. Four trees had borne fruit in the
N&#363;r-afz&#257; garden. I called one of these
<i>S&#863;h&#299;r&#299;n-b&#257;r</i>, the second
<i>K&#863;h&#363;s&#863;h-guw&#257;r</i>, the third, which bore the
most fruit, <i>Pur-b&#257;r</i>, and the fourth, which had less,
<i>Kam-b&#257;r</i>. One tree in K&#863;hurram&rsquo;s garden had also
borne fruit, and I called it <i>S&#863;h&#257;hw&#257;r</i>. There was
a young plant in the little garden of
<i>&#703;Is&#863;hrat-afz&#257;</i> (joy enhancing), and this I called
<i>Nau-b&#257;r</i> (new fruit). Every day I plucked with my own hand
sufficient to give a flavour to my cups. Although they sent them by
runners from Kabul as well, yet to pick them oneself from one&rsquo;s
home garden gave additional sweetness. The
<i>s&#863;h&#257;h-&#257;l&#363;</i> of Kashmir is not inferior to that
of Kabul; it is even better grown. The largest of them weighed one

hasten to the hidden abode of non-existence. He had discovered this

<p class="par">One of the events (that now took place) was the
martyrdom of Sayyid &#703;Izzat<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14047src"
href="#xd24e14047" name="xd24e14047src">92</a> K. and of Jal&#257;l K.
Gakhar in the army of Bangash. The particulars of this are that when
the season for the collection of revenue arrived, Mah&#257;bat K.
appointed a force to go into the hill-country to eat up the crops of
the Afghans, and not omit one tittle of raiding and plundering, and
killing and binding. When the servants of the Court arrived at the foot
of the Pass the ill-fated Afghans attacked them from all sides, and
took the head of the Pass, and fortified it. Jal&#257;l K., who was an
experienced man, and an old man that had undergone labours, thought it
better to delay for a few days, so that the Afghans might expend the
few days&rsquo; provisions they had brought with them on their backs,
and necessarily disperse of their own accord; that then his men would
be able to cross with ease over the head of the difficult Pass. When he
once passed the head of the defile they would be unable to do any more,
and would be punished. &#703;Izzat K., who was a battle-lighting flame
and a foe-burning lightning, did not fall in with Jal&#257;l K.&rsquo;s
idea, and excited the steed of courage of some of the Sayyids of
B&#257;rha. The Afghans, swarming round on all sides, like ants and
locusts, attacked him, and caught him in their midst. Though the
battlefield was not fit for cavalry, yet wherever the forehead of his
wrath shone, he consumed many with the fire of his sword. In the midst
of the fighting they hamstringed his horse, but he fought on foot and
as long as he had breath, and at last fell bravely. At the time when
&#703;Izzat K. made his attack, Jal&#257;l K. Gakhar<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e14050src" href="#xd24e14050" name="xd24e14050src">93</a> and

Maid&#257;n&#299;, and other servants, lost restraint, and rushed on
from all sides of the pass, and the rebels seized the tops of the
hills, and fought with stones and arrows. The devoted young men, both
of the servants of the Court and the retainers of Mah&#257;bat K.,
performed the duties of valour, and slaughtered many of the Afghans. In
this contest Jal&#257;l K. and Mas&#703;&#363;d, with many other brave
men, sacrificed their lives. Owing to the rashness of &#703;Izzat K.
such a disaster as this befell the Imperial army.</p>
<p class="par">When Mah&#257;bat K. heard this fearful news, he sent a
fresh body of men to assist, and strengthened the posts. Wherever they
found a trace of those ill-fortuned ones, they did not fail to slay or
bind them. When I heard this news, I summoned Akbar Qul&#299;, s.
Jal&#257;l K. who had been told off for duty in the conquest of the
fort of K&#257;ngra, to my presence, and gave him the mansab of 1,000
personal and 1,000 horse, and confirmed to him, according to custom,
his hereditary territory (the Gakhar country) in jagir, presented him
with a dress of honour and a horse, and sent him to the support of the
army of Bangash. As &#703;Izzat K. had left a son of very tender years,
keeping before my eyes, that discerned the truth, his life-sacrifice, I
gave him (the child) a mansab and a jagir, so that those left behind
should not be scattered abroad, and others might have increased
hope.</p>

and I released him, giving him a dress of honour and Rs. 1,000 for
expenses, and making him free to go or remain. He justly represented
that his punishment had really been a valuable lesson to him, and that
his desire was to wait on me.</p>

<p class="par first">On Thursday, the 4th of the Il&#257;h&#299; month
of T&#299;r, the Feast of
<i>b&#363;riy&#257;-k&#363;b&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e14081src" href="#xd24e14081" name="xd24e14081src">96</a> took
place. On this day the Kashmir cherries came to an end. From the four
trees of the N&#363;r-afz&#257; garden, 1,500, and from other trees 500
had been plucked. I strictly ordered the officials of Kashmir to plant
<i>s&#863;h&#257;h-&#257;l&#363;</i> (cherry) trees in all the gardens.
On this day Bh&#299;m, s. R&#257;n&#257; Amar Singh, was honoured with
the title of Raja, and Dil&#299;r K., brother of the brave &#703;Izzat
K., was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 800 horse,
Muh&#803;ammad Sa&#703;&#299;d, s. Ah&#803;mad Beg K., to that of 600
personal and 400 horse, and Muk&#863;hli&#7779;-ullah, his brother, to
that of 500 personal and 250 horse. On Sayyid Ah&#803;mad &#7778;adr
the mansab of 1,000, and on M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;usain, s.
M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam &#7778;afaw&#299;, that of 1,000 personal and
500 horse, were bestowed, and the last-named was despatched for duty to
the Deccan. On Sunday, the 14th of the Divine month of T&#299;r,
H&#803;asan &#703;Al&#299; Turkm&#257;n was made Governor of Orissa,
and his personal and horse mansab was raised to 3,000. On this day
Bah&#257;dur K., Governor of Qandahar, sent offerings of nine Iraq
horses, some nine pieces of gold brocade, some brocaded satin, and some
marten<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14087src" href="#xd24e14087" name=
"xd24e14087src">97</a> skins, and other things; these were laid before
me.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 15th, I rode to see the summer quarters

Arriving in two matches at the foot of the <i>kotal</i>, on Wednesday,
the 17th, I reached the top of the pass. For a distance of 2 koss very
elevated ground was crossed with difficulty. From the top of the
<i>kotal</i> to the <i>&#298;l&#257;q</i> (summer quarters) was another
koss of high and low land. Although here and there flowers of various
colours had bloomed, yet I did not see so many as they had represented
to me, and as I had expected. I heard that in this neighbourhood there
was a very beautiful valley, and on Thursday, the 18th, I went to see
it. Undoubtedly, whatever praise they might use in speaking of that
flowery land would be permissible. As far as the eye reached flowers of
all colours were blooming. There were picked fifty kinds of flowers in
my presence. Probably there were others that I did not see. At the end
of the day I turned my reins in order to return. That night an account
was given in my presence of the siege of Ahmadnagar.
K&#863;h&#257;n-Jah&#257;n told a strange tale, which I had also heard
before, and it is written on account of its strangeness. At the time
when my brother D&#257;niy&#257;l was besieging the fort of Ahmadnagar,
one day the garrison laid the gun <i>Malik-maid&#257;n</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e14114src" href="#xd24e14114" name=
"xd24e14114src">99</a> (king of the plain) against the Prince&rsquo;s
camp, and fired it. The ball reached nearly to the Prince&rsquo;s tent;
from that place it bounded (ricocheted), and went to the lodging of
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; B&#257;yaz&#299;d, who was one of the
Prince&rsquo;s companions, and fell there. They had tied up the
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299;&rsquo;s horse at a distance of 3 or 4 gaz. As the
ball touched the ground, the horse&rsquo;s tongue<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e14117src" href="#xd24e14117" name="xd24e14117src">100</a> was
torn out by the root and fell on the ground. The ball was of stone,
weighing 10 maunds as current in Hindustan, or 80 Khurasar maunds. The
said gun is so large that a man can sit comfortably in it.</p>
<p class="par">On this day I promoted Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan, the chief
Bakshi, to the mansab of 5,000 personal and 2,000 horse, Mub&#257;riz
K. to that of 2,000 personal and 1,700 horse. B&#299;zan (or

1,000 personal and 500 horse, and Am&#257;nat K. to that of 2,000
personal and 400 horse. On Thursday, the 25th, I gave
Naw&#257;zis&#863;h K., s. Sa&#703;&#299;d K., the mansab of 3,000
personal and 2,000 horse, Himmat K. that of 2,000 personal and 1,500
horse, and Sayyid Ya&#703;q&#363;b K., s. Sayyid Kam&#257;l
Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#299;, that of 800 personal and 500 horse. M&#299;r

Akbar M&#363;saw&#299;, was dignified with the title of
M&#363;saw&#299; K. As I had repeatedly heard praise of the
<i>&#298;l&#257;q</i> of K&#363;r&#299;-marg,<a class="noteref" id=

much disposed to visit it at this time, and on Tuesday, the 7th
Amurd&#257;d, rode in that direction. How shall I write its praise? As
far as the eye could reach flowers of various hue were blooming, and in
the midst of the flowers and verdure beautiful streams of water were
flowing: one might say it was a page that the painter of destiny had
drawn with the pencil of creation. The buds of hearts break into flower
from beholding it. Undoubtedly there is no comparison between this and
other <i>&#298;l&#257;qs</i>, and it may be said to be the place most
worth seeing in Kashmir.</p>

<p class="par">On Thursday, the 17th, Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K. was
promoted to the mansab of 1,500 personal and 700 horse. On this day the

"#xd24e14214" name="xd24e14214src">105</a> K., ruler of &#362;rganj, by
name Muh&#803;ammad Z&#257;hid, came to the Court, and presented a
petition, accompanied with some trifling presents, and recalled the
existence of hereditary relations (lit., shook the chain of hereditary
connection). I distinguished him with the eye of kindness, and on the
spur of the moment gave the ambassador 10,000 darbs (Rs. 5,000) as a
present, and ordered the officials of the buy&#363;t&#257;t (household)
to prepare and send (by him) such things as he might ask for.</p>
<p class="par">At this time a strange act of grace occurred to my

become very ill from the madness of wine, and from the overpowering of
this man-destroying intoxication things had come to such a pass that it
threatened his precious life. Suddenly he reformed, and God directed
him, and he made a vow that thereafter he would not defile the fringe
of his lip with wine. Although I warned him that it was not good to
give it up all at once, and that he should leave it off gradually, he
would not consent, but gave it up manfully.</p>
<p class="par">On the 25th of Amurd&#257;d Bah&#257;dur K., Governor of
Qandahar, was promoted to the mansab of 5,000 personal and 4,000 horse,

parti-coloured<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14233src" href="#xd24e14233"

themselves greatly in looking out for them. Of these,
&#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K. Naqs&#863;hband&#299; sent a servant of
the name of &#703;Abdu-llah with a letter to K&#863;hw&#257;ja
H&#803;asan and K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m, ss.
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Kal&#257;n J&#363;yb&#257;r&#299;, who are to-day the
leading holy men of Transoxiana, containing a request for these things.
By chance, K&#863;hw&#257;ja H&#803;asan had a perfect tooth,
exceedingly delicate, and immediately sent it with the aforesaid
(servant) to the Court, which it reached this day. I was greatly
pleased, and ordered them to send the value of Rs. 30,000 in choice
goods to the K&#863;hw&#257;jas, a service for which M&#299;r Baraka
Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#299; was fixed upon. On Thursday, the 12th
Shahr&#299;war, M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n obtained leave to take up the
faujd&#257;rship of Mew&#257;t, and his mansab, original and increased,
was fixed at 2,000 with 1,500 horse. I gave him a special horse, with a
dress of honour and a sword.</p>
<p class="par">At this time it was made clear from a report of
Sundar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14246src" href="#xd24e14246" name=
"xd24e14246src">109</a> that Jauhar Mal, the rebel, had delivered his
soul to the lords of hell (had died). It was also reported that a force
sent against one of the Zamindars had abandoned the path of caution,
and without fortifying the way of entrance and exit, or taking
possession of the hill-tops, had entered into the fastnesses of the
hills, and had fought without any good result. As the day drew towards
its close, they had turned their reins with their object
unaccomplished, and in turning back, had made every haste. Many people
had been killed, especially those who would not put up with the
disgrace of flight. They purchased martyrdom with their lives. Out of
them S&#863;h&#257;h-b&#257;z K. Dal&#363;m&#257;n&#299;<a class=

his servants and tribesmen. In truth he was a good servant, and had
intelligence combined with modesty. Another report was that Jam&#257;l
Afg&#863;h&#257;n, Rustam, his brother, Sayyid Na&#7779;&#299;b
B&#257;rha, and some others had come in wounded. It was also reported
that the siege (of K&#257;ng&#7771;a) had become a close one, and the
affair was going hard with the besieged. They had sent (literally
thrown out) men as mediators, and had asked for quarter. It was hoped
that by the blessing of increasing fortune the fort would be
subdued.</p>
<p class="par">On Wednesday, the 18th of the same month
(S&#863;hahr&#299;war), Dil&#257;war K. K&#257;kar died a natural
death. Beyond all the other Amirs of high rank, he combined valour with
leadership and knowledge of affairs, and from the time when I was a
prince carried away from all the ball of superiority in my service. He
acted constantly with the perfection of sincerity and the jewel of
doing right, and had thus arrived at the dignity of Amirship. In the
end of his life God Almighty bestowed grace upon him, and the conquest
of Kis&#863;htw&#257;r, which was an exemplary service, was
accomplished by his courage. It is hoped he may be one of the pardoned.
His sons and the others that he left behind him I exalted with all
kinds of favours and patronage, and enrolled those of his people who
were fit for mansabs amongst the servants of the Court. I ordered the
rest, to remain as usual with his sons, so that his company might not
be split up.</p>
<p class="par">On this day Q&#363;r Yas&#257;wul came with a diamond
that Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K. Fath&#803;-jang had obtained from the Bengal
mine, and waited on me. Waz&#299;r K., d&#299;wan of Bengal, who was an
old servant of the Court, died a natural death.</p>
<p class="par">On the night of Thursday, the 19th, the Kashmiris had
lined with lamps both sides of the Bihat. It is an ancient custom that
every year on this day everyone, whether rich or poor, whoever has a
house on the bank of the river, should light lamps as on the
S&#863;hab-i-bar&#257;t. I asked the brahmans the reason of this, and
they said that on this day the fountain-head of the Jhelam was
disclosed, and the custom had come down from old days that on this date
must take place the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb168" href=

they call thirteen <i>tarw&#257;h</i>; as this day is the 13th of
S&#863;haww&#257;l, they light lamps. In this way they call it the
<i>Veth tarw&#257;h</i>. Undoubtedly the lamp-lighting was good. I sate
in a boat and went round to see it. On this day the feast of my solar
weighing took place, and according to the usual custom, I weighed
myself against gold and other things, which I distributed among
deserving people. The 51st year of the age of this suppliant at the
throne of Allah came to an end; the 52nd year lit up the face of
expectation. It is hoped that the period of my life will be spent in
pleasing God. The entertainment of Thursday, the 26th, was held in the
lodging of &#256;&#7779;af K. (N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s brother),
and that pillar of the Sultanate fulfilled the duties of homage, and of
offerings, and thereby acquired eternal bliss.</p>

<p class="par">On this day unpleasant news came from
Kis&#863;htw&#257;r. The details of this are that when Dil&#257;war K.
conquered it and returned to Court, he left Na&#7779;ru-llah
&#703;Arab, with some of the mansabdars to guard it. Na&#7779;ru-llah
made two mistakes. One was that he treated the Zamindars and the people
of the place harshly, and did not observe a conciliatory demeanour
towards them. The second was that the forces sent as auxiliaries to
him, in expectation of increase of mansab, asked him for leave to go to
Court and transact their affairs. He yielded to their
representations,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14468src" href=
"#xd24e14468" name="xd24e14468src">119</a> and gave them leave one
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb171" href="#v2pb171" name=
"v2pb171">171</a>]</span>after the other. When only a small force was
left with him, the Zamindars, whose hearts had been wounded by him, and
were on the look out for a disturbance, found their opportunity and
made an attack from all quarters. Having burnt the bridge by which the
army had crossed, and by which assistance could come, they lighted the
fire of disturbance and sedition. Na&#7779;ru-llah shut himself up, and
for two or three days defended himself with the greatest difficulty
(literally, with a thousand life-extractions). As he had no provisions,
and they had closed the road, he determined to accept martyrdom, and
manfully, with some of those who were with him, performed the dues of
bravery and valour until most of his men were killed, and some became
captives in the hands of destiny.</p>
<p class="par">When this news reached my ear, I appointed Jal&#257;l,
s. Dil&#257;war K., on whose forehead the traces of bravery and
ambition were manifest, and who had done good service in the conquest
of Kis&#863;htw&#257;r, with the mansab of 1,000 personal and 600
horse, giving him the attendants of his father who were enrolled among
the servants of the Court, and an army of the soldiers of Kashmir, with
many of the Zamindars and men on foot with muskets, to assist him in
overcoming that mob, doomed to a vile end. An order was also given that
R&#257;ja Sangr&#257;m, the Zamindar of Jammu, with his own men, should

quickly obtain the recompense for their deeds.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 28th, I marched 4&frac12; koss. Passing
one koss beyond K&#257;k&#257;p&#363;r, I came to the bank of the
river. The <i>bang</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e14482src" href=

K&#257;k&#257;p&#363;r is well-known. It grows wild on the bank of the
river in quantities. On Sunday, the 29th, I halted at the village of
Panj Br&#257;ra.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14488src" href=

S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z. His Vakils had prepared a small building
and a little garden overlooking the river. In the neighbourhood of Panj

Lahore. He had nearly reached ninety years of age. He was one of the
brave men of the age and valiant in the battlefield. He combined
bravery with leadership. He performed great services for the dynasty.
It is hoped that he will be among the pardoned ones. He left four sons,
but none of them was worthy to be his son. He left about Rs. 400,000 in
cash and goods, which were given to his sons.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 30th, I first visited the fountain of
Inch. This village had been given by my father to R&#257;m D&#257;s
Kachhw&#257;ha,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14526src" href="#xd24e14526"

place. Its water is perfectly clear and pure, and many fish swim in
it.</p>

idol-temple. The beauty of this spring is more than one can describe,
and large trees of ancient years, planes, white and black poplars, have
grown up round it. I passed the night at this place, and on Tuesday,
the 31st, pitched at the fountain of Achval.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e14550src" href="#xd24e14550" name="xd24e14550src">129</a> The
water of this spring is more plentiful than that of the other, and it
has a fine waterfall. Around it lofty plane-trees and graceful white
poplars, bringing their heads together, have made enchanting places to
sit in. As far as one could see, in a beautiful garden,
<i>Ja&#703;far&#299;</i> flowers had bloomed, so that one might say it
was a piece of Paradise. On Wednesday, the 1st of Mihr, marching from
Achval, I pitched camp near the fountain of Virnag.<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e14557src" href="#xd24e14557" name="xd24e14557src">130</a> On
Thursday, the 2nd, the feast of cups was prepared at the spring. I gave
my private attendants permission to sit down. Filling brimming cups, I
gave them Kabul peaches as a relish, and in the evening they returned
drunk (<i>mast&#257;n</i>, exhilarated?) to their abodes. This spring
is the source of the River Bihat, and is situated at the foot of a
hill, the soil of which, from the abundance of trees and the extent of
green and grass, is not seen. When I was a prince, I had given an order
that they should erect a building at this spring suitable to the place.
It was now completed. There was a reservoir of an octagonal shape,
forty-two yards in area and fourteen<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e14563src" href="#xd24e14563" name="xd24e14563src">131</a> gaz in
depth. Its water, from the reflection of the grass and plants on the
hill, had assumed a hue of verdure. Many fish swam in it, round it
halls with domes had been erected, and there was a garden in front of
them. From the edge of the pond to the gate<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e14566src" href="#xd24e14566" name="xd24e14566src">132</a> of the
garden there was a canal 1 gaz in width and 180<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e14569src" href="#xd24e14569" name="xd24e14569src">133</a> gaz in
length, and 2 gaz in depth. Round the reservoir was a stone walk
(<i>k&#863;hiy&#257;b&#257;n-i-sang</i>). <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb174" href="#v2pb174" name="v2pb174">174</a>]</span>The water of
the reservoir was so clear that, notwithstanding its 4 gaz of depth, if
a pea had fallen into it, it could have been seen. Of the trimness of
the canal and the verdure of the grass that grew below the fountain,
what can one write? Various<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14578src" href=
"#xd24e14578" name="xd24e14578src">134</a> sorts of plants and
sweet-smelling herbs grew there in profusion, and among them was seen a
stem (<i>b&#363;&#7789;&#257;</i>), which had exactly the appearance of
the variegated tail of a peacock. It waved about in the ripple, and
bore flowers here and there. In short, in the whole of Kashmir there is
no sight of such beauty and enchanting character. It appears to me that
what is upstream<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14584src" href=
"#xd24e14584" name="xd24e14584src">135</a> in Kashmir bears no
comparison with (<i>i.e.</i>, is far superior to) what is downstream.
One should stay some days in these regions, and go round them so as to
enjoy oneself thoroughly. As the hour for marching was near, and snow
was beginning to fall at the head of the passes, I had not the leisure
to linger there, and was obliged to turn my rein towards the city. I
gave an order that plane-trees should be planted on both sides, on the
banks of the canal above mentioned. On Saturday, the 4th, I encamped at
the spring of Loka Bhawan.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14590src" href=
"#xd24e14590" name="xd24e14590src">136</a> This spring is also a
pleasant spot. Although at present it is not equal to the others, if it
were to be repaired it would be very good. I ordered them to construct
a building worthy of the place, and to repair the reservoir in front of
it. On the road I passed by a spring which they call Andha
N&#257;g<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14594src" href="#xd24e14594" name=
"xd24e14594src">137</a> (blind fountain. <i>See</i>
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, 166). It is well known that the fish in this
fountain are blind. I delayed a while near this spring, and threw in a
net and caught twelve of the fish. Of these, three were blind and nine
had eyes. Evidently the water of this spring has the effect of making
them blind. Certainly this is not devoid of strangeness. On Sunday, the
5th, I again passed by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb175" href=
"#v2pb175" name="v2pb175">175</a>]</span>the springs of Machh&#299;
Bhawan and Inch, and went to the city.</p>
<p class="par">On Wednesday, the 8th, news arrived of the death of
H&#257;s&#863;him, s. Q&#257;sim K. On Thursday, the 9th, Ir&#257;dat
K. was promoted to the governorship of Kashmir. M&#299;r Jumla in his
place was chosen for the duty of <i>K&#863;h&#257;ns&#257;m&auml;n</i>,
and Mu&#703;tamid<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14610src" href=

<i>&#703;Arz&#804;-muqarrir</i>. The mansab of 2,000 personal and 500
horse was ordered for M&#299;r Jumla. On the night of Saturday, the
11th, I entered the city. &#256;&#7779;af K. was appointed to the duty
of Diwan of Gujarat. Sangr&#257;m, Raja of Jammu, was promoted to the
mansab of 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse.</p>
<p class="par">On this day I saw an unusual kind of fishing on the part
of the fishermen of Kashmir. In a place where the water was up to a
man&rsquo;s chest, they propelled two boats that were side by side, and
so that at one end they were in contact, and at the other end they were
14 or 15 yards apart. Two boatmen held long poles in their hands, and
sate on the outside edge of each boat (?) so as to regulate the space
between each boat, and that they should proceed equally. Then ten or
twelve boatmen got down into the water, and laying hold of the ends of
the two boats that were joined<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14618src"
href="#xd24e14618" name="xd24e14618src">139</a> together with their
hands, trampled the bottom with their feet, and moved on. The fish
which were between the boats wanted to get out of the narrow space, and
came against the feet of the boatmen. Immediately one of the boatmen
dived, and another one pressed upon his back, and with his two hands
kept him from coming to the surface. The latter caught a fish and
produced it. Some who are skilful in the art catch two fish with their
hands, and bring them to the surface. Among them was an old boatman,
who generally at each dive brought up two fish. This kind of fishing
occurs at Panj Br&#257;ra,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14624src" href=
"#xd24e14624" name="xd24e14624src">140</a> and is peculiar to the
Jhelam. It is not used in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb176" href=
"#v2pb176" name="v2pb176">176</a>]</span>ponds or in other streams. It
also only takes place in the spring when the water is not cold or
impetuous (<i>gazanda</i>, &ldquo;biting&rdquo;?).</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 13th, the feast of the Dasah&#7771;a took
place. According to the annual custom, they decorated the horses in the
special stables, and those that had been entrusted to Amirs, and
brought them out. At this time I experienced in myself a shortness of
breath and difficulty in breathing. I hope that in the end, please God,
it may all go well.</p>
<p class="par">On Wednesday, the 15th, I went to make an autumn tour in
the direction of &#7778;af&#257;p&#363;r and the valley of L&#257;r,
situated downstream of the Kashmir River. In &#7778;af&#257;p&#363;r
there is a fine tank, and on the north side of it a hill full of trees.
It being the beginning of autumn, it had a wonderful appearance, with
trees of all colours, such as the planes, the apricot, and others,
reflected in the middle of the tank, and very beautiful. Undoubtedly
the beauties of autumn are not less than those of spring.</p>

<p class="par first">As the time was short and the hour of marching
near, I took a short circuit and returned. These few days I passed
pleasantly in catching<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14646src" href=
"#xd24e14646" name="xd24e14646src">141</a> ducks. One day, in the midst
of the sport, a boatman caught and brought me a young <i>qarqara</i>
(the demoiselle crane, <i>Ardea virgo</i>). It was very thin and
miserable. It did not live longer than one night. The <i>qarqara</i>
does not live in Kashmir. This had become ill and thin at the time of
coming from, or going to, Hindustan, and fallen there.</p>
<p class="par">On Friday news came of the death of M&#299;rz&#257;
Rah&#803;m&#257;nd&#257;d, s. the
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n. He died a natural death at
B&#257;l&#257;p&#363;r. It appears that he had been suffering from
fever for some days. When he was recovering, the Deccanis one day
appeared with an army. His elder brother, D&#257;r&#257;b K., mounted
with the intention of fighting. When the news <span class=

bravery, notwithstanding his weakness and failing health, he went to
his brother. After he had beaten the enemy, he returned and in taking
off his <i>jubba</i> (quilted waistcoat) was not sufficiently careful.
The wind immediately caught him, and he was seized with convulsions,
and his tongue became powerless to speak. He remained two or three days
in this state and died. He was a good and brave youth, was fond of
sword-play, and was very zealous. In every place it was his idea to
display his skill with the sword. Although fire burns equally what is
green and what is dry, yet it appeared very grievous to me, and what
must it have been to his broken-hearted old father? Hardly had the
wound from the calamity of S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K. healed, when
he received this fresh wound. I trust that God Almighty may give him
patience and resignation.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 16th, K&#863;hanjar K. was promoted to
the mansab of 3,000 personal and horse, Q&#257;sim K. to that of 2,000
personal and 1,000 horse, and Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain, brother of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, who held the post of
Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; to the army of K&#257;ngra, that of 800

href="#xd24e14671" name="xd24e14671src">142</a> of Monday, the 27th of
the Divine month of Mihr, after one watch and seven gharis had passed,
the royal standards were raised auspiciously and happily to return
towards Hindustan. As the saffron had blossomed, a march was made from
the neighbourhood of the city to the village of
P&#257;mp&#363;r.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14674src" href=
"#xd24e14674" name="xd24e14674src">143</a> In the whole country of
Kashmir there is saffron only in this place. On Thursday, the 30th, the
feast of cups was held in a saffron field. Groves on groves, and plains
on plains were in bloom. The breeze in that place scented one&rsquo;s
brain. The stem is attached (close?) to the ground. The flower has four
petals, and its colour is that of a violet. It is of the size of a
<i>champa</i> flower, and from the middle of it three stigmas of
saffron grow. They plant the bulbs, and in a good year obtain 400
maunds of the current <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb178" href=

to the government, and half to the cultivators. A seer is bought and
sold for Rs. 10. Occasionally its market price is more or less, and it
is an established custom that they bring the saffron flowers plucked,
and according to the plan they have adopted from of old, they take half
its weight in salt as wages. There is no salt in Kashmir, and they
bring it from Hindustan. Again, among the excellencies of Kashmir are
the plumes of feathers (<i>kalg&#299;</i>) and the hawks
(<i>j&#257;nwar-i-s&#863;hik&#257;r&#299;</i>). As much as 10,700
feathers are yearly obtained. Hawks and falcons are taken in nets to
the number of 260. It has also nest sparrow-hawks
(<i>b&#257;s&#863;ha</i>),<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14695src" href=
"#xd24e14695" name="xd24e14695src">145</a> and the nest sparrow-hawk is
not bad. On Friday, the 1st of the divine month of &#256;b&#257;n,
marching from P&#257;mp&#363;r, I pitched my camp at
K&#863;h&#257;np&#363;r. As it was reported to me that
Zamb&#299;l<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14700src" href="#xd24e14700"

Inj&#363;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14703src" href="#xd24e14703"

the end of the hilly country buildings should be erected at each stage
for the accommodation of myself and the ladies, for in the cold weather
one should not be in tents. Although the buildings at this stage had
been completed, as they were still damp and there was a smell of lime,
we put up in tents. On Saturday, the 2nd, I halted at Kalamp&#363;r. As
it had repeatedly been represented to me that in the neighbourhood of
H&#299;r&#257;p&#363;r there was a waterfall<a class="noteref" id=

high and wonderful, as it was 3 or 4 koss off on the left <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb179" href="#v2pb179" name=

can be written in its praise? The water pours down in three or four
gradations(?). I had never seen such a beautiful waterfall. Without
hesitation, it is a sight to be seen, very strange and wonderful. I
passed the time there in enjoyment till the third watch of the day, and
filled my eye and heart with the sight; but in the cloudy and rainy
season it is not devoid of wildness. After the third watch had passed,
in the evening I rode back to H&#299;r&#257;p&#363;r,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e14715src" href="#xd24e14715" name="xd24e14715src">150</a> and
passed the night at that stage. On Monday, the 4th, crossing over the
<i>kotal</i> of B&#257;r&#299; Br&#257;r&#299;,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e14721src" href="#xd24e14721" name="xd24e14721src">151</a> I chose
P&#299;rpanjal, at the head of the <i>kotal</i>, for a halting-place.
Of the roughnesses of the pass and the difficulties of this road what
shall I write? It is difficult for thought even to cross it. In these
last few days snow had repeatedly fallen, the hills had become white,
and in the middle of the path in some places ice had formed, so that
the hoof of a horse had no hold, and a rider could only pass with
difficulty. God Almighty bestowed upon us His mercy, for it did not
snow on this day. The advantage was for those who went on in front.
Those who followed came in for snow. On Tuesday, the 5th, going by the
pass of P&#299;rpanjal the camp was pitched at Pos&#863;h&#257;na.
Although on this side there is a descent, yet as it is high, most of
the people passed it on foot. On Wednesday, the 6th, we pitched at
Bahramgalla. Near this village there is a waterfall and a very fine
spring. According to orders, they had made a terrace for me to sit
upon; indeed, this is a sight to be seen. I ordered that they should
engrave on a stone tablet the date of the crossing, and place it on the
top of the terrace (<i>&#7779;uffa</i>). B&#299;-badal K.<a class=

fortune remains on the path of poetry as a memorial on the tablet of
Time(?). There are two Zamindars on this road in whose charge are the
arrangements <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb180" href="#v2pb180"

reality the keys of the country of Kashmir. They call one Mahd&#299;
N&#257;yak and the other H&#803;usain N&#257;yak. The charge of the
road from H&#299;r&#257;p&#363;r to Bahramgalla is in their hands.
Bahr&#257;m N&#257;yak, the father of Mahd&#299; N&#257;yak, during the
Kashmiri government, was an important person. When the authority passed
to the imperial servants, M&#299;rz&#257; Y&#363;suf K., during his
government, made Bahr&#257;m N&#257;yak a traveller to the country of
non-existence. It is now equally in the possession and charge of the
two.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14742src" href="#xd24e14742" name=

really bear great enmity towards each other. On this day
S&#863;haik&#863;h Ibn Yam&#299;n, who was one of the old trusted

night when we were encamped above the <i>kotal</i> of P&#299;rpanjal,
the tents and furniture had not arrived. He was rather infirm and the
cold affected him, and he became cramped so that he could not speak. He
remained alive for two days in this state and then died. I gave over

(<i>maim&#363;n</i>) were seen in Bahramgalla, and from that stage a
great difference was apparent in the climate, the language, the
clothing, the animals, and whatever properly belongs to a warm country.
The people here speak both Persian and Hindi. Evidently Hindi is their
real language, and they have acquired Kashmiri on account of the
proximity of Kashmir. Briefly, one enters India at this place. The
women do not wear woollen clothing, and like Indian women, they wear

The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb181" href="#v2pb181" name=

Hindus, and the landholders are called Rajas. Sult&#804;&#257;n
F&#299;r&#363;z made them Muhammadans, but they are still called Rajas.
They still have the marks of the times of ignorance. One of these is
that just as some Hindu women burn themselves along with their husbands
(bodies), so these women (the R&#257;jaur women) are put into the grave
along with their (dead) husbands. I heard that recently they put alive
into the grave a girl of ten or twelve along with her (dead) husband,
who was of the same age. Also, when a daughter is born to a man without
means, they put her to death by strangulation.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e14777src" href="#xd24e14777" name="xd24e14777src">157</a> They
ally themselves with Hindus, and both give and take girls. Taking them
is good, but giving them, God forbid! I gave an order that hereafter
they should not do such things, and whoever was guilty of them, should
be capitally punished. There is a river at R&#257;jaur. Its water
during the rainy season becomes much poisoned. Many of the people there
get a swelling (<i>b&#363;g&#863;hma</i>) under the throat, and are
yellow and weak. The rice of R&#257;jaur is much<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e14786src" href="#xd24e14786" name="xd24e14786src">158</a> better
than the rice of Kashmir. There are self-grown and sweet-scented
violets in this skirt of the hills.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 10th, I encamped at Naus&#863;hahra. At
this place, by order of my father, they had built a stone fort, and
there is constantly here, by way of a station (<i>th&#257;na</i>), a
body of men from the governor of Kashmir. On Monday the camp was at
Chauk&#299; Hatt&#299;. A <i>chela</i> named Mur&#257;d had exerted
himself to complete the buildings at this place, and had done it well.
In the middle of the royal abode there was a fine terrace, superior to
those of other stages. I increased his mansab. On Tuesday, the 12th, I
halted at Bh&#299;mbar. Passing this day out of <i>kotals</i> and
hills, we entered the broad plains of Hindustan. The hunters had
previously been dispatched to form <i>qamurg&#863;has</i>, so as to
prepare <i>jirgas</i> (hunting rings) in Bh&#299;mbar and
Girjh&#257;k<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14807src" href="#xd24e14807"
name="xd24e14807src">159</a> and Makhiy&#257;la. On Wednesday
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb182" href="#v2pb182" name=

I rejoiced in a hunt. Hill <i>q&#363;chq&#257;r</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e14820src" href="#xd24e14820" name="xd24e14820src">160</a>
etc., to the number of 56 head were taken. On this day R&#257;ja
S&#257;rang Deo, who was one of the intimate attendants, was promoted
to the mansab of 800 personal and 400 horse. On Saturday, the 16th, I
went towards Girjh&#257;k, and in five marches encamped on the bank of
the Bihat. On Thursday, the 21st, I hunted in the hunting-ring of
Girjh&#257;k. Less game than usual was taken, and I was not satisfied.
On Monday, the 25th, I hunted with much enjoyment in the hunting-ring
of Makhiy&#257;la,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14823src" href=
"#xd24e14823" name="xd24e14823src">161</a> thence in ten stages I
encamped at the stage of the hunting-place of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#257;b&#257;d. When I was prince, this was my
hunting-place. Afterwards, I founded a village with my own name, and
erecting a small building, placed it in charge of Sikandar
Mu&#703;&#299;n, who was one of my best huntsmen. After I came to the
throne I made a pargana of it, and bestowed it as a jagir on him. I
gave an order that they should construct there a building as a royal
residence, with a tank and a minaret<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e14829src" href="#xd24e14829" name="xd24e14829src">162</a>
(man&#257;ra). After his death this pargana was given in jagir to
Ir&#257;dat K., and the charge of the buildings was given to him. It
has now been handsomely completed. Undoubtedly the tank was very
broad,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14833src" href="#xd24e14833" name=
"xd24e14833src">163</a> and in the middle there is a delightful
building. Altogether the buildings here cost Rs. 1,50,000. Really it is
a kingly hunting-place. On Thursday and Friday, having halted, I
enjoyed myself with various kinds of sport. Q&#257;sim K., who was
honoured with the charge of Lahore, had the good fortune to pay his
respects to me, and presented 50 muhars.</p>
<p class="par">In one march after this stage I encamped at the garden
of M&#363;min &#703;Is&#863;hq-b&#257;z,<a class="noteref" id=

has some lofty plane-trees and handsome cypresses. It is certainly a
rare garden. On Monday, the 9th of the Divine month of &#256;z&#817;ar,
corresponding with the 5th Muh&#803;arram of <span class=

mounting an elephant of the name of Indra, I went towards the city,
scattering coin as I proceeded. After three watches and two gharis of
day had passed, at the selected auspicious hour, having entered the
royal residence, I alighted happily and auspiciously at the building
recently brought to completion and finished handsomely by the exertions
of Ma&#703;m&#363;r K. Without exaggeration, charming residences and
soul-exciting sitting places had been erected in great beauty and
delicacy, adorned and embellished with paintings by rare artists.
Pleasant green gardens with all kinds of flowers and sweet-scented
herbs deceived the sight.</p>

<p class="par">On this day the joy-enhancing news of the conquest of
the fort of K&#257;ng&#7771;a rejoiced our mind. In thankfulness for
this great boon and important victory, which was one of the renewed
favours of the Bestower of Gifts, I bowed the head of humility at the
throne of the merciful Creator, and beat with loud sounds the drum of
gladness and pleasure. K&#257;ng&#7771;a is an ancient fort to the
North of Lahore, situated in the midst of the hill country, famous for
its strength and the difficulty of conquering it. Who was the founder
of this fort God only knows. The belief of the Zamindars of the
province of the Panjab is that, during this period the said fort has
never passed to any other tribe, and no stranger has stretched out to
it the hand of dominion. Wisdom is from <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb184" href="#v2pb184" name="v2pb184">184</a>]</span>Allah! But
certainly from the time when the voice of Islam and the sound of the
established religion of Muh&#803;ammad reached Hindustan, not one of
the Sultans of lofty dignity has obtained the victory over it.
Sult&#804;&#257;n F&#299;r&#363;z-s&#863;h&#257;h, with all his power
and might, himself went to conquer it, and besieged it for a long time.
As he knew that the strength of the fort was such that as long as the
means for holding it and provisions were with the besieged, victory
over them was unattainable, <i>nolens volens</i> he was contented with
the coming of the Raja to pay his respects to him, and withheld his
hand. They say that the Raja prepared an offering and an entertainment,
and at his request took the Sultan inside the fort. The Sultan, after
going round and inspecting it, said to the Raja that to bring a king
like him inside the fort was not according to the dictates of caution.
What could he do if the body of men who were in attendance were to
attack him and take possession of the fort? The Raja made a sign to his
men, and instantaneously an army of valiant men armed and accoutred,
came out from a concealed place and saluted the Sultan. The Sultan
became suspicious and anxious about an attack from these men, and
suspected some stratagem. The Raja came forward and kissed the ground
of service, and said: &ldquo;I have no thought but that of service and
obedience, but as has been spoken by the auspicious tongue, I observe
far-sighted caution, for all times are not the same.&rdquo; The Sultan
applauded him. The Raja, having accompanied him for some stages,
obtained leave to return. After this, whoever sat on the throne of
Delhi sent an army to subdue K&#257;ng&#7771;a, but the thing went no
further. My revered father also sent a large army once under the
leadership of H&#803;usain Qul&#299; K., who, after approved service,
was honoured with the title of K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n. Whilst the
siege was in progress, the outbreak of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain
M&#299;rz&#257; took place. That ingrate fled from Gujarat, and raised
the flag of rebellion and calamity towards the Panjab. K&#863;h&#257;n
Jah&#257;n was compelled to raise the siege, and to turn to extinguish
the flame of his sedition. Thus the acquisition of the fort fell into
the knot of delay. The thought was continually lurking in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb185" href="#v2pb185" name=
"v2pb185">185</a>]</span>royal mind: &ldquo;The longed-for Fair one
does not show her face from the secret place of Destiny.&rdquo; When by
the Grace of the Glorious God the throne of the State was adorned by
the existence of this suppliant, this was one of the holy wars which I
considered incumbent on me. In the first instance I dispatched
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K., who was governor of the Panjab, with a force of
brave men skilled in war, to conquer the fort. This important matter
had not been completed when Murtaz&#803;&#257; K. attained to the mercy
of God (died). After this Jauhar Mal,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e14875src" href="#xd24e14875" name="xd24e14875src">168</a> s.
R&#257;ja B&#257;so, undertook this duty. I sent him, giving him the
command of the army. That wicked one, taking to evil revolt and
ingratitude, committed sin, and dispersion found its way into that
army, and the acquisition of the fort fell into the knot of delay. No
long time elapsed before that ingrate received the recompense of his
deeds and went to hell, as has been described in its own
place.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e14881src" href="#xd24e14881" name=
"xd24e14881src">169</a> In fine, at this time K&#863;hurram undertook
that duty, and sent his own servant Sundar<a class="noteref" id=

all haste, and many of the royal servants obtained leave to go to his
support. On the 16th S&#863;haww&#257;l, <span class="sc">A.H.</span>
1029, (5 September, 1620), the armies, having invested the fort,
erected batteries. Looking to the ways of entrance into and exit from
the fort with the eye of caution, they closed the road for the entrance
of provisions. By degrees the besieged became straitened, and when
there remained in the fort no grain that they could eat, for four
months more they boiled dry grasses<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e14894src" href="#xd24e14894" name="xd24e14894src">171</a> with
salt and ate it. When destruction was imminent, and no hope of escape
was left, they asked for quarter and surrendered the fort.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 1st Muh&#803;arram, <span class=

distant to the short-sighted, God Almighty of His own grace and mercy
granted to this suppliant. The troops, who had displayed praiseworthy
activity in this service, were exalted according to their exertions and
fitness by increase of mansab and dignities.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 11th, I went, at the request of
K&#863;hurram, to his newly-built house. I took those of his offerings
that pleased me. Three elephants were placed in the private stud. On
the same day I appointed &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K.
Naqs&#863;hband&#299; to the faujd&#257;rship of the district of
K&#257;ng&#7771;a, and his mansab was fixed at 2,000 personal and 1,500

Qiy&#257;m-k&#863;h&#257;n&#299; K. obtained leave to take charge of
the fort of K&#257;ng&#7771;a, and his mansab, original and increased,
was fixed at 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. S&#863;haik&#863;h
Faiz&#803;u-llah, son-in-law of Murtaz&#803;&#257; K., was appointed in
company with him to stay at the top of the fort
(<i>b&#257;l&#257;-i-qil&#703;a</i>).</p>
<p class="par">On the night of Saturday, the 13th of the same month, a
lunar eclipse took place. Having performed the dues of humility at the
throne of the highest and most powerful God, cash and goods were
distributed by way of charity among the faqirs and poor, and deserving
people. On this day Zamb&#299;l Beg, ambassador of the ruler of Persia,
had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. After performing
salutation, he laid before me the gracious letter of that brother of
high degree, containing expressions of sincerity and perfect
friendship. He presented 12 <i>&#703;Abb&#257;s&#299;</i><a class=

trappings, three <i>t&#363;ygh&#363;n</i> (white) falcons, five mules,
five camels, nine bows, and nine scimitars. The Shah had given him
leave, in company with K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, but for certain
necessary matters he could not come with him. On this day he arrived at
Court. I presented him with a superb dress of honour, with a plume and
a jewelled turban fringe, and a jewelled dagger. Wi&#7779;&#257;l Beg
and H&#803;&#257;j&#299; Ni&#703;mat, who had come with <span class=

Am&#257;nu-llah, s. Mah&#257;bat K., was promoted to the mansab,
original and increased, of 2,000 and 1,500 horse. At the request of
Mah&#257;bat K., I added 300 horse to the mansab of Mub&#257;riz K.
Afg&#863;h&#257;n, and brought it up to 2,000 personal and 1,700 horse.
One hundred horse were also added to the mansab of Kabak<a class=

&#703;Abdu-llah K. and Las&#863;hkar K. At the request of Q&#257;sim K.
I went to his garden in the neighbourhood of the city, and in the
course of the procession, scattered 10,000 <i>charans</i> (4-anna
pieces). Out of his offerings I selected one ruby and one diamond, and
some cloths.</p>
<p class="par">On the night of Sunday, the 21st, the advanced camp
proceeded auspiciously and happily towards Agra. Barq-and&#257;z K. was
appointed superintendent of artillery with the army of the Deccan.
S&#863;haik&#863;h Ish&#803;&#257;q (Isaac) was appointed to duty at
K&#257;ng&#7771;a. The brother of Allah-d&#257;d, the Afghan, I
released from prison, and made him a present of Rs. 10,000. I gave also
a <i>t&#363;ygh&#363;n</i> falcon to K&#863;hurram. On Thursday, the
26th, the usual entertainment took place. The presents from the ruler
of Persia, which had been sent by Zamb&#299;l Beg, were laid before me.
I gave an elephant to Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain, and made a

Most of the Amirs and the chief servants went to his house with gifts.
He prepared a grand entertainment with much ceremony. It is hoped that
it may be auspicious to him. As that Chief of the State had erected
lofty buildings, and highly decorated bowers in his house, he invited
me to an entertainment. I went there with the ladies. He had prepared a
great feast, and laid before me appropriate offerings of all kinds. In
order to please him, I took such as I approved of. On this day Rs.
50,000 were presented to Zamb&#299;l Beg, the ambassador. The mansab of
Zabar-dast K. was fixed at 1,000 personal and 500 horse, original and
increased. Maq&#7779;&#363;d, brother of Q&#257;sim K., was promoted to
the mansab of 500 personal and 300 horse, and M&#299;rz&#257;
Dakhan&#299;, s. M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam, to that of 500 personal and
200 horse.</p>
<p class="par">At this auspicious time<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e14984src" href="#xd24e14984" name="xd24e14984src">178</a> when
the standards of victory and conquest were in Kashmir, the province of
eternal spring, happily employed in sight-seeing and sport,
representations constantly came from the officials in the Southern
territories to the effect that when the victorious standards went to a
distance from the centre of the Khalifate, the rulers of the Deccan,
owing to their wickedness, broke their promises and raised their heads
by giving trouble and exciting sedition, and placing their feet beyond
their own boundary, took possession of many of the districts of
Ahmadnagar and Berar. It was constantly reported that the chief object
of these evil-fortuned ones was to plunder and ruin the cultivated
fields and the grazing-lands. When at the first time the world-opening
standards had proceeded to the conquest of the regions of the south and
the overthrow of that band, and K&#863;hurram, with the vanguard, had
gone to Burhanpur, they, by feline tricks suitable to such seditious
people, made him their intercessor and evacuated the royal dominions.
They also sent by way of tribute large sums in cash and goods, and
promised that they would not let loose from their hands the rope of
service, and would not place their feet beyond the boundary of respect,
as has been recorded in the preceding <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb189" href="#v2pb189" name="v2pb189">189</a>]</span>pages. At the
request of K&#863;hurram, I had halted for a few days at the Fort of
S&#863;h&#257;d&#299;&#702;&#257;b&#257;d M&#257;nd&#363;, and at his
intercession, and on their humiliation and bewailing, they were
pardoned.</p>
<p class="par">As they had now broken their agreement through evil
disposition and quarrelsomeness, and had turned back from the way of
obedience and service, I sent off the hosts of good fortune again under
his leadership, that they might receive retribution for their evil
deeds, and be an example to all those of crooked fortune and turned
heads. But as the important business of K&#257;ng&#7771;a had been
entrusted to him, he had sent most of his experienced men there. For
some days, accordingly, he could not arrange the matter. At last,
report followed on report one after another, that the enemy had
gathered strength, and that nearly 60,000 vagabond horsemen had
collected together and taken possession of royal territory, and
wherever there were posts, had removed them, and joined together in the
town of Mahakar. For three months the imperialists had passed their
days in strife and fighting with their rascally enemies, and during
this time three pitched battles had taken place, and each time the
self-sacrificing servants (of the State) had proved superior to the
evil-fortuned rebels. As grain and provisions could not reach the camp
by any road, and the enemy was plundering on all sides of the army of
good fortune, a great scarcity of grain resulted, and the animals were
in bad plight. Having no choice, they came down from the
B&#257;l&#257;g&#863;h&#257;t, and took up their position at
B&#257;l&#257;p&#363;r. The rebels, waxing valiant in their pursuit,
engaged in plundering in the neighbourhood of B&#257;l&#257;p&#363;r.
Of the servants of the Court 6,000 or 7,000 horsemen, well mounted,
were selected, and they made an attack on the enemy&rsquo;s camp. They
(the enemy) numbered about 60,000 cavalry. Briefly, a great fight took
place, and their camp was plundered. Having killed and taken prisoners
many of them, they returned in safety and with plunder. When they
turned back those wretches again attacked them from all sides, and they
came on, fighting as far as the camp. On both sides about 1,000 were
killed. After this fight they (the imperialists) <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb190" href="#v2pb190" name=
"v2pb190">190</a>]</span>remained about four months at
B&#257;l&#257;p&#363;r. When the scarcity of grain became excessive,
many of the qulaqch&#299;s (servants) ran away and joined the enemy,
and constantly bands of them, taking to the road of disloyalty, were
enrolled among the rebels. On this account, not considering it
advisable to delay any longer, they (the imperialists) came to
Burhanpur. Again, those wretches followed them and besieged Burhanpur,
and they were six months shut up there. Many parganas of the provinces
of Berar and Khandesh passed into their possession, and they stretched
out the hand of oppression over the cultivators and poor, and engaged
in collecting the revenues. As the army had undergone great hardships
and the animals had fallen into bad condition, they could not leave the
city to inflict substantial punishment. Thus the pride and conceit of
those short-sighted ones became greater. Just at this time the royal
standards returned to the capital, and by the grace of God
K&#257;ng&#7771;a was conquered.</p>
<p class="par">Accordingly, on Friday, the 4th of Dai, I despatched
K&#863;hurram in that direction, bestowing on him a dress of honour, a
sword, and an elephant. N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam also gave him an
elephant. I told him after he had conquered the province of the Deccan

great pains produced all kinds of delicate and rare things. In order to
please her, I took what I approved. I halted two days at this place. It
was settled that the officials of the Panjab should send Rs. 200,000,
in addition to the Rs. 60,000 already ordered for provisions for the
fort of Qandahar. M&#299;r Qiw&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n, the diwan of the

proceed to that region, conferring on him a robe of honour, a horse,

<p class="par">On Thursday the camp was pitched outside the town of
Sihrind. I halted one day, and amused myself with going round the
garden. On Sunday, the 4th, Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan was sent on service

<i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i>, a special shawl, an elephant named

place of encampment of good fortune in the neighbourhood of the

<p class="par">Thence, in five marches, I reached the pargana of

the 23rd, I passed through the district of Delhi with the intention of
hunting in the pargana of P&#257;lam, and halted on the bank of the
S&#863;hams&#299; tank. On the road I scattered 4,000 <i>charans</i>

<p class="par">I went by boat from Delhi, and in six stages reached the

auspicious hour proceeded to the fort, and entered the palace happily

<p class="par">As Las&#863;hkar K. had satisfactorily performed his
duties at Agra, I increased his mansab by 1,000 personal and 500 horse,

S&#863;hahriy&#257;r. Muz&#804;affar K., according to order, came from
Thatta, and had the good fortune to wait on me. He offered 100 muhars

<p class="par">On Friday, the 28th, I went to hunt to the village of
Samonagar, and returned at night. Seven Persian horses, with their

Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l, Jarrett, II. 347, puts Kashmir into the third

Srinagar. The appellation &ldquo;White Islands&rdquo; is probably a
mistake for &ldquo;The Fortunate Islands,&rdquo; <i>saf&#299;d</i>

south-east of Kashmir. Measured by the compass,
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s 67 is much more correct than
Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l&rsquo;s 120. The I.G. new edition gives the area

word used by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r is <i>dara&#703;</i>, which is given by
Steingass as Arabic, and as meaning a yard. <i>Z&#817;ara&#703;</i>
again, is given as equal to a cubit. Clearly Jah&#257;ng&#299;r uses
the word here as equivalent to a <i>gaz</i> or yard, for he says that
there are 5,000 <i>dara&#703;</i> in the koss adopted by himself and
his father, and Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l in the &#256;y&#299;n (Jarrett,
II. 414) says the koss is 5,000 <i>gaz</i>. The word <i>dara&#703;</i>
is also rendered <i>gaz</i> in the Hindustani translation of the
Memoirs. There is an important discrepancy between the two I.O. MSS.
and the printed text of the Memoirs. The former, instead of saying that
the <i>dara&#703;</i> or yard is = 2 <i>s&#863;har&#703;&#299;
dara&#703;</i>, say that 1&frac14; <i>dara&#703;</i> are = 2

(Jarrett, II. 417) the <i>gaz</i> is given as equal to 24 digits. See
later on, p. 303 of text, where, in describing S&#863;h&#257;h
S&#863;huj&#257;&rsquo;s accident, 7 <i>dara&#703;</i> are said to be

number of boatmen at 33,870, and the boats, exclusive of private ones,
at 2,417. The revenue of Kashmir, as stated by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, is
that mentioned in the &#256;y&#299;n, Jarrett, II. 366, and is

According to the two I.O. MSS.&mdash;which are corroborated by the
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma&mdash;the text has here omitted an important part
of the report&mdash;presumably a written one&mdash;submitted by the
Qazi and the M&#299;r &#703;Adl. After the words &ldquo;denied
it,&rdquo; there comes in the MSS. the statement: &ldquo;The
H&#803;ak&#299;m-z&#257;da (H&#803;ak&#299;m&rsquo;s son) produced two
witnesses in court. The Sayyids invalidated (or impeached) the
testimony of one of them, and the H&#803;ak&#299;m-z&#257;da brought a
third witness and proved his case according to law.&rdquo; The
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, p. 161, has not the whole of this, and it has
<i>k&#863;h&#257;rij</i> instead of <i>j&#257;rih</i>, but it has the
words <i>guw&#257;h-i-s&#804;&#257;lis&#804;</i> (&ldquo;a third

Veth is the Kashmiri name for the Jhelam (Lawrence, 18). It is
contracted from Vitasta. It is curious that the date of the festival
should be given according to a Muhammadan month (S&#863;haww&#257;l),
which must recur at different seasons. Apparently the meaning is that
the birth of the Jhelam took place on that day.</p>
<p class="par footnote cont">Apparently the festival is not much
celebrated nowadays, for it is not mentioned by Lawrence
(264&ndash;266), except that in a note to p. 266 the Vathtrwah is
mentioned as a day on which daughters receive presents. The 19th
S&#863;hahr&#299;war, the corresponding date mentioned by
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, would answer to the end of August or beginning of
September, and to the Hindu month of &#256;sin. 13 S&#863;haww&#257;l,
1029, would correspond to 1 September, 1620. Possibly the
S&#863;haww&#257;l of text is a mistake for the Hindu month
S&#257;wan&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Sr&#257;van. The legend of the birth of
the Jhelam is told in Stein, 97. Possibly S&#863;haww&#257;l does not
here mean the month, and we should read
<i>s&#863;hag&#863;hal-i-chir&#257;g&#863;h&#257;n</i>, &ldquo;the

text wrongly gives this as a list of birds which are found in Kashmir.
The Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma 159 and the MSS. show that the text has
omitted a negative, and that the list consists of Indian birds which
are <i>not</i> met with in Kashmir. Several of the names do not occur
in the dictionaries. No 2 (the s&#257;ras) is described in
Babur&rsquo;s Memoirs, 321. No. 4 is the florikan, or <i>Otis
Bengalensis</i>. For Nos. 5&ndash;7 see Babur&rsquo;s Memoirs, 321.
Karaw&#257;n is a crane in Arabic, apparently, and so Karw&#257;nak
should be a little crane. It is also described as a kind of partridge.
Perhaps the Karw&#257;nak is the demoiselle crane. No. 9 may be the
oriole, or mango-bird, but that, too, is common in Kashm&#299;r. For
No. 12, which may be the ibis, see Babur&rsquo;s Memoirs, 322. For No.
14 see Babur&rsquo;s Memoirs, p. 321, and for No. 18 Babur&rsquo;s
Memoirs, 320. For the S&#863;h&#257;rak (No. 19), see Babur&rsquo;s
Memoirs, 319. No 22 may possibly be the bee-eater (<i>Merops
viridis</i>). For No. 23 see Babur&rsquo;s Memoirs, 267 and 321. No. 25
may be one of the parrots, as H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804; called the Indian
parrots and poets
<i>&#7789;u&#7789;iy&#257;n-i-s&#863;hakar-s&#863;hikan</i>. See

birthday, not to Jah&#257;ngir&rsquo;s? The 17th here mentioned is the
17th of the solar month of Dai, and corresponded to about December 28,
1620. In the following page (324) we are told that the lunar weighment
took place on 30 Bahman, corresponding to 25
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, February 8, 1621:
Jah&#257;ngir&rsquo;s birthday was on Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal 17, so
the anniversary fell this year on 22 Bahman. Consequently, if he
celebrated it, as stated on p. 323, on 17 Dai, he did so more than a
month too soon! Evidently there is a mistake somewhere.&nbsp;<a class=

Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-&#257;k&#863;hir, <span class="sc">A.H.</span> 1030
(10 March, 1621), the sun that bestows bounty on the world lit up the
abode of fortune of Aries with his world-illuminating light, and
gladdened the world and its inhabitants. The sixteenth year of the
reign of this suppliant at the throne of Allah commenced with gladness
and victory, and at the auspicious hour and blessed time I sat on the
throne of success in the capital of Agra. On this joy-enhancing day my
fortunate son S&#863;hahriy&#257;r lifted up his head with the honour
of the mansab of 8,000 and 4,000 horse. My revered father bestowed, for
the first time, this mansab<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15288src" href=
"#xd24e15288" name="xd24e15288src">2</a> on my brothers. It is hoped
that in the shadow of my education and in carrying out my pleasure, he
may reach the extreme of life and prosperity. On this day B&#257;qir K.
arrayed his men and passed them before me in order. The great Bakhshis
recorded (the number as) 1,000 horse and 2,000 foot, and reported to
me. Having promoted him to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 1,000
horse, I entrusted the duties of faujd&#257;r of Agra to him.</p>
<p class="par">On Wednesday, together with the ladies seated in a boat,
I went to the N&#363;r-afs&#863;h&#257;n garden, and rested there at
night. As the garden belongs to the establishment of N&#363;r
Jah&#257;n B., on Thursday, the 4th, she held the royal<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e15293src" href="#xd24e15293" name=
"xd24e15293src">3</a> entertainment and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb200" href="#v2pb200" name="v2pb200">200</a>]</span>presented great
offerings. Of jewels, jewelled ornaments, and all sorts of precious
goods, I selected what I approved of, of the value of Rs. 100,000.
During these days, every day after midday I embarked in a boat, and
went to Samonagar, 4 koss distant from the city, for sport, returning
to the palace at night. Sending R&#257;ja S&#257;rang Deo to my
prosperous son S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z, I sent with him a special
dress of honour, with a jewelled belt, which contained a
sapphire<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15298src" href="#xd24e15298" name=
"xd24e15298src">4</a> and several rubies. As I had given Behar to that
son in the place of Muqarrab K., I started off a <i>saz&#257;wul</i> to
conduct him from Allahabad to Behar. M&#299;r Z&#257;hid,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e15306src" href="#xd24e15306" name=
"xd24e15306src">5</a> son-in-law of Muz&#804;affar K., having come from
Thatta, waited on me. As M&#299;r &#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daula<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e15310src" href="#xd24e15310" name=
"xd24e15310src">6</a> had become very old and decrepit, he could not
carry out the duties of the camp and his jagir. I released him from the
trouble of service and active work. I ordered that he should receive
Rs. 4,000 every month out of the public treasury, and living at ease
and in comfort at Agra or Lahore, or wherever he wished, should employ
himself in prayers for my increased life and welfare.</p>
<p class="par">On the 9th Farward&#299;n the offering of
I&#703;tib&#257;r K. was laid before me. Of jewels, cloths, etc., the
value of Rs. 70,000, was accepted, and I returned the remainder to him.
Muh&#803;ibb &#703;Al&#299; and &#256;q&#257; Beg, envoys of the ruler
of Persia, presented twenty-four horses, two mules, three camels, seven
greyhounds (<i>sag-i-t&#257;z&#299;</i>), twenty-seven pieces
(<i>t&#804;&#257;q</i>) of brocade, a
<i>s&#863;ham&#257;ma</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e15323src" href=
"#xd24e15323" name="xd24e15323src">7</a> of ambergris, two pairs of
carpets, and two <i>namad takya</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e15328src" href="#xd24e15328" name="xd24e15328src">8</a> (woollen
coverlets). Two mares with foals that my brother had sent with them
were also brought before me.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, at the request of &#256;&#7779;af K., I
went to his house with the ladies. Having prepared a grand
entertainment, he submitted to me many delicate gems and wonders in
cloths, and rare gifts. Choosing out of these to the value of Rs.
130,000, I gave the rest to him. Mukarram K., governor <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb201" href="#v2pb201" name=
"v2pb201">201</a>]</span>of Orissa, sent by way of offering thirty-two
elephants, male and female, and these had the honour of being accepted.
At this time I saw a wild ass<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15335src"
href="#xd24e15335" name="xd24e15335src">9</a>
(<i>g&#363;r-k&#863;har</i>), exceedingly strange in appearance,
exactly like a lion. From the tip of the nose to the end of the tail,
and from the point of the ear to the top of the hoof, black markings,
large or small, suitable to their position, were seen on it. Round the
eyes there was an exceedingly fine black line. One might say the
painter of fate, with a strange brush, had left it on the page of the
world. As it was strange, some people imagined that it had been
coloured. After minute inquiry into the truth, it became known that the
Lord of the world was the Creator thereof. As it was a rarity, it was
included among the royal gifts sent to my brother S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;Abb&#257;s. Bah&#257;dur K. Uzbeg had sent as an offering some
tipch&#257;q horses and cloth stuffs from &#703;Ir&#257;q, and they
were produced before me. Dresses of honour for the winter were sent for
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K. Fath&#803;-jang and the Amirs of Bengal by
M&#363;min S&#863;h&#299;r&#257;z&#299;. On the 15th the offering of
&#7778;&#257;diq K. was produced. It was of all sorts. Having taken
what was worth Rs. 15,000, I gave the remainder to him.
F&#257;z&#803;il K. on this day also gave an offering according to his
condition. Of this a trifle was taken. On Thursday (19th
Farward&#299;n) the feast of the culmination was held, and when two
watches and one ghari of the day had passed, I took my seat on the
throne. According to the request of Mad&#257;r-ul-mulk
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula, the feast of the culmination was held in
his house. He presented a remarkable offering of rare and choice things
from all countries. Altogether I took the value of Rs. 138,000. On this
day I gave Zambil Beg, the ambassador, a muhar<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e15347src" href="#xd24e15347" name="xd24e15347src">10</a> equal to
200 <i>tolas</i> in weight. At this time Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K. had sent
some eunuchs from Bengal. One of these was a hermaphrodite. Among the
offerings of the above-mentioned were two boats <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb202" href="#v2pb202" name=
"v2pb202">202</a>]</span>made in Bengal, of a very pleasant shape, on
the decoration of which a sum of Rs. 10,000 had been expended. They
were really kingly boats. Having made S&#863;haik&#863;h Q&#257;sim K.
governor of Allahabad, I honoured him with the title of
Muh&#803;tas&#863;him K. and the mansab of 5,000, and gave an order
that the Diwans should give him an increase to his jagir out of the
unappropriated (<i>mah&#803;&#257;ll-i-ghair-i-&#703;amal&#299;</i>)
estates. R&#257;ja S&#863;hy&#257;m Singh, Zamindar of Sr&#299;nagar
(in Garhw&#257;l) was given a horse and an elephant.</p>
<p class="par">At this time it was reported to me that Y&#363;suf K.,
s. H&#803;usain K.,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15361src" href=
"#xd24e15361" name="xd24e15361src">11</a> had died in the victorious
army of the Deccan a sudden death. The report said that when he was at
his jagir he had become so fat that he got out of breath with the least
exertion. One day when he was paying his respects to K&#863;hurram, in
coming and going his breathing<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15364src"
href="#xd24e15364" name="xd24e15364src">12</a> became difficult. When a
dress of honour was given him, in putting it on and saluting he became
helpless, and a trembling affected all his limbs, and with a hundred
labours and exertions he saluted and stumbled out and fell under the
shelter of the tent enclosure, and became unconscious. His servants
placed him in a palanquin, and took him home, and as he arrived, the
messenger of death came also. He received his command, and left his
heavy lump of earth in the perishable dustbin. On 1st
Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, I gave a special dagger to Zambil Beg, the
ambassador. On the 4th of the same month the feast of the
<i>k&#257;r-i-khair</i> (consummation of marriage) of my son
S&#863;hahriy&#257;r increased the joy of my heart. The
H&#803;inna-band&#299; (putting on henna) assembly took place in the
palace of Maryamu-z-zam&#257;n&#299;. The feast of the
<i>nik&#257;h&#803;</i> (marriage) was held in the house of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula. I myself went there with the ladies and
adorned the feast of joy. After seven gharis of night had passed, on
Friday<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15374src" href="#xd24e15374" name=
"xd24e15374src">13</a> the marriage took place with rejoicings. I hope
that it will be propitious to this daily-increasing State. On Tuesday,
the 19th, in the N&#363;r-afs&#863;h&#257;n garden, I presented my son
S&#863;hahriy&#257;r with a jewelled <i>ch&#257;rqab</i> (coat), with a
turban and waist-belt (<i>kamar-band</i>), <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb203" href="#v2pb203" name=
"v2pb203">203</a>]</span>and two horses, one an &#703;Ir&#257;q&#299;,
with a gold saddle, and the other a Turk&#299;, with an embroidered
saddle.</p>
<p class="par">In these days S&#863;h&#257;h S&#863;huj&#257;&#703; had
an eruption so violent that water would not go down his throat, and his
life was despaired of. As it had been recorded in his father&rsquo;s
horoscope that his son would die this year, all the astrologers were
unanimous that he would not live, but Jotik R&#257;y said, on the
contrary, that the dust of calamity would not settle on the skirt of
his life. I asked: &ldquo;By what proof?&rdquo; He said that in the
horoscope of my destiny it was recorded that in this year no distress
or trouble would find its way to the royal mind from any road, and as I
had a great affection for the child, it behoved that no calamity should
happen to him, and some other child would die. It came to pass as he
said, and he carried his life out of this deadly place, and a son that
he (S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n) had by the daughter of
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K., died at Burhanpur. Besides this, many of
Jotik R&#257;y&rsquo;s judgments (ah&#803;k&#257;m) turned out correct.
This is not without strangeness, and it is therefore recorded in these
memoirs. I accordingly ordered him (Jotik R&#257;y) to be weighed
against money and the weight came to Rs. 6,500. This was given him as a
reward.</p>
<p class="par">Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain J&#257;bir&#299; was
appointed Bakhshi and newswriter of the Subah of Orissa. The mansab of
L&#257;ch&#299;n Munajjim (astrologer) Q&#257;qs&#863;h&#257;l, at the
request of Mah&#257;bat K., was fixed, original and increased, at 1,000
personal and 500 horse. Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain, brother of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, came from K&#257;ng&#7771;a and waited on
me. Having presented an elephant to Bah&#257;dur K. Uzbeg, I sent it
with his Vakil. Hurmuz and H&#363;s&#863;hang, grandsons of the asylum
of pardon M&#299;rz&#257; Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;ak&#299;m, by reason of
the caution that is fitting to rulers, had been imprisoned in the fort
of Gwalior. At this time, having summoned them into my presence, I
ordered them to remain in Agra, and a daily allowance sufficient for
their expenses was allowed for them. At this time a brahman of the name
of R&#363;dar Bhattach&#257;raj, who was one of the learned ones of

fortune to pay his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb204" href=

has studied well, both in the rational and traditional sciences, and is

<p class="par">One of the strange events of this time<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e15394src" href="#xd24e15394" name="xd24e15394src">14</a> was
that on 30 Farward&#299;n (about 10 April, 1621) in the present year,
in a certain village of the pargana of J&#257;landhar, in the morning,
a terrible noise arose from the East, such that its inhabitants, from
fright at that terror-increasing sound, nearly deserted their bodies.
Whilst this noise and disturbance were going on, a light fell from
above on the ground, and the people thought that fire was raining down
from heaven. After a moment, when that noise ceased, and their troubled
hearts recovered from their bewilderment and terror, they sent a quick
runner to the collector (<i>&#703;&#257;mil</i>) Muh&#803;ammad
Sa&#703;&#299;d, and informed him of what had occurred. He immediately
rode there himself, and went to look at the spot. For ten or twelve
yards in length and breadth the land was so burnt that no trace of any
grass or green was left, and there were still signs of heat and
burning. He ordered them to dig up the soil, and the more they dug the
greater the heat appeared to be till they came to a place where a piece
of heated iron appeared. It was as hot as if it had been taken out of a
furnace. After a while it became cold, and taking it up, he conveyed it
to his house, and placing it in a <i>k&#863;har&#299;&#7789;a</i>
(cover), which he sealed, he sent it to Court. I ordered them to weigh
it in my presence, and it came to 160 <i>tolas</i>. I ordered Master
(Ust&#257;d) D&#257;&#702;&#363;d<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15406src"
href="#xd24e15406" name="xd24e15406src">15</a> to make a sword, a
dagger, and a knife of it, and bring them to me. He represented that it
would not stand below the hammer, and fell to pieces. I told him in
that case to mix it with other iron and make use of it. As I had told
him, he mixed three parts of lightning-iron and one of other iron, and
having made two swords, one dagger, and one knife, brought them to me.
From the mixing of other iron he had brought out its quality
(watering). According to the manner of the excellent swords of
Yaman<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15410src" href="#xd24e15410" name=
"xd24e15410src">16</a> and the South, it could be bent, and became
straight again. I ordered them to test <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb205" href="#v2pb205" name="v2pb205">205</a>]</span>it in my
presence. It cut very well, equal to true swords. I called one the
S&#863;hams&#863;h&#299;r-i-q&#257;t&#804;i&#703; (keen sword) and the
other Barq-siris&#863;ht (lightning-natured). B&#299;-badal K. composed
a quatrain which demonstrated<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15420src"
href="#xd24e15420" name="xd24e15420src">17</a> these particulars, and
recited it:</p>

my fortunate son S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z, came and waited on me.
Parw&#299;z represented that he, according to order, had proceeded from
Allahabad to Behar. I hope he will be prosperous (there). Q&#257;sim K.
was dignified with the gift of drums. On this day one
&#703;Al&#299;mu-d-d&#299;n, a servant of K&#863;hurram, brought a

jewelled thumbstall (<i>s&#863;hast</i>, perhaps a ring), which he had
sent as <i>naz&#817;ar</i>. I gave him leave, sending by him a dress of

<p class="par">On the 4th of the Divine month<a class="noteref" id=

K&#863;hurd&#257;d, Afz&#803;al K., K&#863;hurram&rsquo;s Diwan brought
a letter from him containing the good news of his victory, and kissed
the threshold. The details are as follows: When the victorious army
reached Ujain, a band of the servants of the Court, who were in the
fort of M&#257;nd&#363;, sent a report that an army of the rebels,
putting forward the foot of audacity, had crossed the Narbad&#257;, and
burning several villages that were under<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e15470src" href="#xd24e15470" name="xd24e15470src">20</a> the
fort, were busy with rapine and plunder. Mad&#257;ru-l-mah&#257;mm
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan, with 5,000 cavalry, were
appointed to go in all haste and inflict punishment on that vain lot of
people. The K&#863;hw&#257;ja made a night march, and at the dawn of
day reached the bank of the Narbad&#257;. When the enemy learnt this,
they in one moment threw themselves into the river and reached the bank
of safety. The brave cavalry galloped after them, and pursued them for
nearly 4 koss,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15473src" href="#xd24e15473"
name="xd24e15473src">21</a> and with the sword of vengeance, made many
of them travellers on the road of non-existence. The ill-fated rebels
did not turn back the reins of haste till they reached Burhanpur.
K&#863;hurram wrote to Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan to remain on that (the
South) side of the river till he came. Soon he, with his army, joined
this advanced force, and hastened on, march by march, till he reached
Burhanpur. The graceless rebels were still keeping<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e15476src" href="#xd24e15476" name="xd24e15476src">22</a> their
ground, and were encamped round the city. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb207" href="#v2pb207" name="v2pb207">207</a>]</span>As the imperial
servants had been contending with the rebels for two years, they had
suffered much hardship from want of land
(<i>b&#299;-j&#257;g&#299;r&#299;</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e15512src" href="#xd24e15512" name="xd24e15512src">23</a>
non-possession of fiefs, landlessness) and scarcity of corn, and their
horses were worn out by continued service. Accordingly, they had to
delay nine days in order to recruit. During this period, thirty lakhs
of rupees and many cuirasses<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15518src" href=
"#xd24e15518" name="xd24e15518src">24</a> were distributed among the
soldiers, and <i>saz&#257;wuls</i> had been sent out and had brought
many men out of the city (Burhanpur). The gallant troops had not yet
put their hands to the work, when the black-fated rebels felt that they
could not resist, and scattered like &ldquo;the daughters of the
Bier&rdquo; (the stars of the constellation of the Great Bear, which
are dispersed over the heavens, instead of being clustered like the
Pleiades). The brave and swift cavaliers followed them, and with the
sword of vengeance cast many of them upon the earth of perdition. They
gave them no rest, but smiting and slaying them, pursued them as far as
Khirk&#299;, which was the residence of the Niz&#804;&#257;mu-l-mulk
and the other rebels. One day before this the ill-starred one (Malik
&#703;Ambar) had got information of the approach of the imperialists,
and had removed the Niz&#804;&#257;mu-l-mulk and his family and effects
to the fort of Daulatabad. There he had encamped, with his back resting
on the fort, while in front of him there were marshes and
quagmires.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15539src" href="#xd24e15539"
name="xd24e15539src">25</a> Most of his men became scattered in all
directions. The leaders of the victorious army, with their
vengeance-seeking soldiers, halted three days in the town of
Khirk&#299;, and so destroyed a city <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb208" href="#v2pb208" name="v2pb208">208</a>]</span>which had taken
twenty years to build, that it is not known if it will regain its
splendour in other twenty years. In fine, after throwing down its
buildings, all agreed in opinion that as an army of rebels was still
besieging Ahmadnagar, they must at once go there, and inflict condign
punishment on the originators of the disturbance, renew the supplies
(of the Ahmadnagar garrison), and leave assistance there, and then
return. With this view they set out, and came as far as the town of
Patan (in Berar, Jarrett II. 233). Meanwhile, the crafty
&#703;Ambar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15557src" href="#xd24e15557"
name="xd24e15557src">26</a> sent agents and officers, and said:
&ldquo;After this I will not drop the thread of service and loyalty
from my hand, nor put out my foot beyond orders, and will regard
whatever tribute and fine be commanded as a favour, and will send it to
the government.&rdquo; It happened that just then there was great
scarcity in the camp in consequence of the dearness of provisions, and
also that news came that the rebel force which was besieging Ahmadnagar
had withdrawn on hearing of the approach of the imperialists.
Accordingly, a force was sent to help K&#863;hanjar K. (the governor of
Fort Ahmadnagar), and a sum of money for his charges. Thereupon the
imperialists were relieved from all anxiety and returned (across the
Narbad&#257;?). After much entreaty and lamentation (on the part of
&#703;Ambar) it was settled that in addition to the territory which of
old had belonged to the empire, the rebels should surrender 14 koss of
the adjoining country, and should pay into the public treasury fifty
lakhs of rupees as tribute.</p>
<p class="par">I gave Afz&#803;al K. (S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s diwan) leave to return, and sent with him, for
K&#863;hurram, the ruby plume (<i>kalg&#299;-i-la&#703;l&#299;</i>)
which the King of Persia had sent to me, and which has been already
described, and I gave to the aforesaid (Afz&#803;al) a dress of honour,
an elephant, an inkpot, and a jewelled pen. K&#863;hanjar K., who, when
besieged in the Fort of Ahmadnagar, had performed approved services,
and shown proper activity, was promoted to the mansab of 4,000 personal
and 1,000 horse.</p>
<p class="par">Mukarram K., having come by order from Orissa, had,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb209" href="#v2pb209" name=

upon me. He presented a string of pearls by way of offering.
Muz&#804;affaru-l-mulk, s. Bah&#257;duru-l-mulk, was honoured with the
title of Nu&#7779;rat K. A standard was conferred on &#362;d&#257;
R&#257;m, Dakhan&#299;, and to &#703;Az&#299;zu-llah, s. Y&#363;suf K.,
was given the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. On Thursday, the
21st, Muqarrab K. arrived from Behar, and had the good fortune to wait
upon me. At this time &#256;q&#257; &#703;Al&#299;, Muh&#803;ibb
&#703;Al&#299; Beg, H&#803;&#257;j&#299; Beg, and F&#257;z&#803;il Beg,
the envoys of the ruler of Persia, who had come at different times,
were allowed to depart. To &#256;q&#257; Beg I made a present of a
dress of honour, a jewelled dagger, and Rs. 40,000 in cash; to
Muh&#803;ibb &#703;Al&#299; Beg a dress of honour and Rs. 30,000; and
to the others in the same way I presented gifts according to their
positions. I also sent a suitable souvenir by them to my brother. On
this day Mukarram K. was appointed Subahdar of Delhi, and faujd&#257;r
of Mewat. S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;&#257;t K. &#703;Arab was dignified
with the mansab of 3,000 personal and 2,500 horse, original and
increased; S&#863;harza K. with that of 2,000 and 1,000 horse; Girdhar,
s. R&#257;y S&#257;l Kachhw&#257;ha, with that of 1,200 and 900
horse.</p>
<p class="par">On the 29th, Q&#257;sim Beg, an envoy of the ruler of
Persia, came and waited on me, bringing a letter from that brother of
lofty dignity, containing expressions of sincerity and friendship. What
he had sent by way of royal gifts was laid before me. On the 1st of
T&#299;r, I sent a special elephant called Gaj Ratan, for my son
(<i>farzand</i>) K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n. Naz&#804;ar Beg, a servant
of K&#863;hurram, laid before me a letter from him asking for the gift
of horses. I ordered R&#257;ja Kis&#863;han D&#257;s, the mus&#863;hrif
(accountant) to prepare within fifteen days 1,000 horses from the royal
stables, and to send them off with him. I sent to K&#863;hurram as a
present a horse of the name of R&#363;m-ratan<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e15577src" href="#xd24e15577" name="xd24e15577src">27</a>
(&ldquo;the jewel of Turkey&rdquo;), which the ruler of Persia had sent
me out of the spoils of the Turkish camp.</p>
<p class="par">On this day a servant of Ir&#257;dat K., of the name of
G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n, laid before me a report from him
containing the good news of his victory. In the preceding pages there
has been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb210" href="#v2pb210" name=
"v2pb210">210</a>]</span>written with the pen of demonstration an
account of the rebellion of the Zamindars of Kis&#863;htw&#257;r and of
the despatch of Jal&#257;l, s. Dil&#257;war K. As this important matter
had not been properly managed by him, an order was given to Ir&#257;dat
K. to hasten to take up that duty, and to inflict severe punishment on
the rebels, and make such arrangements in the hill-country that the
dust of dispersion and calamity might not settle on its frontiers. He,
as ordered, hastened there and did approved service, and the people of
sedition and disturbance, having turned their heads towards the desert
of exile, escaped half dead. Thus once more was the thorn of calamity
and mischief rooted out of that country, and having established the
officials and established posts, he returned to Kashmir. As a reward
for this service I added 500 horse to his mansab.</p>
<p class="par">As K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan had done
good service and shown proper activity in the affair of the Deccan, I
increased his mansab by 1,000 horse. Ah&#803;mad Beg, nephew of
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K. Fath&#803;-jang, being exalted to the Subahdarship
of Orissa, was dignified with the title of <i>K&#863;h&#257;n</i>, and
had given him a standard and drums. His mansab also was raised to 2,000
with 500 horse.</p>
<p class="par">As I had often heard of the virtues and good qualities
of Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; Na&#7779;&#299;r of Burhanpur, my truth-seeking
mind had a desire for his society. At this time he came, according to
summons, to the Court. Doing honour to his learning, I paid him great
regard. The Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; is one of the unique of the age for
rational and traditional sciences, and there are few books that he has
not read, but his exterior did not agree with his interior, and I could
not be delighted with his company. As I found him much devoted to being
a dervish and seclusion, I respected his feelings, and did not give him
the trouble of serving me. I gave him Rs. 5,000, and dismissed him to
his native country to pass his days in ease.</p>
<p class="par">On the 1st of the Divine month of Amurd&#257;d
B&#257;qir K. was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 1,200
horse, and of the Amirs and royal servants who had distinguished
themselves in the conquest of the Deccan, thirty-two <span class=

mansabs raised. &#703;Abdu-l-&#702;Az&#299;z K. Naqs&#863;hband&#299;,
who had been appointed to the governorship of Qandahar at the request
of my son K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, was promoted to that of 3,000
personal and 2,000 horse. On the 1st S&#863;hahr&#299;w&#257;r I gave
the ambassador Zambil Beg a jewelled sword, and also presented him with
a village under the jurisdiction of the capital, the revenue of which
was Rs. 16,000.</p>
<p class="par">At this time, knowing that he was unfit for duty on
account of his bad temper and want of knowledge, I dismissed
H&#803;ak&#299;m Rukn&#257;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15600src" href=
"#xd24e15600" name="xd24e15600src">28</a> and told him he might go
wherever he wished. As it was reported to me that H&#363;s&#863;hang,
the brother&rsquo;s son of K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, had
committed an unjust murder, having summoned him to my presence, I
investigated the charge, and after it was established, gave an order
for his execution. God forbid that in such affairs I should consider
princes, and far less that I should consider Amirs. I hope that the
grace of God may support me in this. On 1st S&#863;hahr&#299;war, at
the request of &#256;&#7779;af K., I went to his house and bathed in
the bath-house that he has lately built. It is beautifully finished.
After I had done bathing he laid before me offerings fit for a
<i>naz&#817;ar</i>. I took what I approved of and gave him the rest.
The <i>Waz&#804;&#299;fa</i> (pension) of K&#863;hiz&#803;r
K&#863;h&#257;n (late ruler) of Khandesh, was fixed at Rs.

<p class="par">At this time it was reported to me that a blacksmith of
the name of Kaly&#257;n was much in love with a woman of his own caste,
and was always laying his head at her feet, and showing symptoms of
infatuation. The woman, though she was a widow, would in no way consent
to accept him, and the love of this wretch who had given his heart to
her made no impression on her. Having summoned both of them into my
presence, I cross-examined them, and however much I advised her to
unite herself to him, she did not agree. At this time the blacksmith
said that if he could make sure that I would<a class="noteref" id=

mind the S&#863;h&#257;h-burj; if your love be genuine, fling yourself
from the roof of this house, and I&rsquo;ll make her submit herself to
you.&rdquo; I had not ended before he ran like lightning and threw
himself down. When he fell, blood began to flow from his eyes and
mouth. I repented myself greatly of that jest, and was grieved in my
mind, and bade &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n take him to his house
and look after him. As the cup of his life was brimming over, he died

the day of the Dasahara festival in Kashmir, I had perceived in myself
a catching and shortness of breath. Briefly, from excessive rain and
the dampness of the air, a difficulty in drawing breath showed itself
on my left side near the heart. This by degrees increased and became
intensified. Of the physicians who were in waiting on me,
H&#803;ak&#299;m R&#363;h&#803;u-llah first tried his remedies, and for
some time warm, soothing medicines were of use, for there was evidently
a slight diminution (of the symptoms). When I came down from the hills,
they came on again violently. This time for some days I took
goats&rsquo; milk, and again camel&rsquo;s milk, but I found no profit
whatever from them. About this time H&#803;ak&#299;m Rukn&#257;, who
had been excused from the journey to Kashmir, and whom I had left at
Agra, joined me, and confidently and with a show of power, undertook my
cure, and relied on warm and dry medicines. From his remedies, too, I
derived no advantage; on the contrary, they appeared to increase the
heat and dryness of my brain and temperament, and I became very weak.
The disease increased and the pain was prolonged. At such a time and in

position more honourable than that of the other Court-physicians, with
the idea that at some crisis he would help me. That ungrateful man, in
spite of the claims which I had on him, though he saw me in such a
state, did not give me medicines or treat me. Notwithstanding that I
distinguished him beyond all the physicians who were waiting on me, he
would not undertake my cure. However great attention I showed him and
troubled myself to soothe him, he became more obstinate
(<i>&#7779;ullab</i>), and said: &ldquo;I have no such reliance on my
knowledge that I can undertake the cure.&rdquo; It was the same with
H&#803;ak&#299;m Ab&#363;-l-Q&#257;sim, s. H&#803;ak&#299;mu-l-mulk,
notwithstanding his being a k&#863;h&#257;naz&#257;d, and what was due
for his bringing up; he professed himself suspicious and afraid, and
that considering the matter in his mind, he was terrified and vexed,
and how, then, could he prescribe a remedy? As there was no help for
it, I gave them all up, and weaning my heart from all visible remedies,
gave myself up to the Supreme Physician. As drinking alleviated my
sufferings, I took to it in the daytime, contrary to my habit, and
gradually I carried this to excess. When the weather became hot, the
evil effects of this increased, and my weakness and laboured breathing
were augmented. N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam, whose skill and experience
are greater than those of the physicians, especially as they are
brought to bear through affection and sympathy, endeavoured to diminish
the number of my cups, and to carry out the remedies that appeared
appropriate to the time, and soothing to the condition. Although
previously to this she had approved of the remedies <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb214" href="#v2pb214" name=
"v2pb214">214</a>]</span>made use of by the physicians, yet at this
time I relied on her kindness. She, by degrees, lessened my wine, and
kept me from things that did not suit me, and food that disagreed with
me. I hope that the True Physician will grant me perfect recovery from
the hospital of the hidden world.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 22nd<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15651src"
href="#xd24e15651" name="xd24e15651src">33</a> of the same month,
corresponding with the 25th of S&#863;haww&#257;l, <span class=
"sc">A.H.</span> 1030 (2 September, 1621), the feast of my solar
weighing took place auspiciously and happily. As in the past year (of
my life) I had suffered from severe illness, I had passed it in
continuous pain and trouble. In thankfulness that such a year ended
well and in safety, and that in the commencement of the present year
the signs of health became apparent, N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam begged
that her Vakils might make the arrangements for the entertainment (of
the solar weighment). In truth, they prepared one which increased the
astonishment of beholders. From the date on which N&#363;r Jah&#257;n
Begam entered into the bond of marriage with this suppliant, although
in all weighing entertainments, both solar and lunar, she had made such
arrangements as were becoming to the State, and knew what were the
requirements of good fortune and prosperity; yet on this occasion she
had paid greater attention than ever to adorn the assembly, and arrange
the feast. All the servants of approved service and the domestics who
knew my temperament, who in that time of weakness had constantly been
present and been ready to sacrifice their lives, and had fluttered
round my head like moths, were now honoured with suitable kindnesses,
such as dresses of honour, jewelled sword-belts, jewelled daggers,
horses, elephants, and trays full of money, each according to their
positions. And though the physicians had not done good service, yet in
consideration of the slight contempt<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e15657src" href="#xd24e15657" name="xd24e15657src">34</a> with
which they had been treated for two or three days, they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb215" href="#v2pb215" name=
"v2pb215">215</a>]</span>received various favours, and on the occasion
of this feast also, they received presents in jewels and cash.</p>
<p class="par">After the conclusion of the weighment, trays of gold and
silver were poured out by way of <i>nis&#804;&#257;r</i>
(coin-scattering) into the hope-skirts of the ministers of amusement
(<i>ahl-i-nis&#863;h&#257;t&#804;</i>), and of the poor. Jotik
R&#257;y, astrologer, who had given the glad news of my recovery and
restoration to health, I had weighed against muhars and rupees, and by
this method a present was made<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15681src"
href="#xd24e15681" name="xd24e15681src">35</a> him of 500 muhars and
7,000 rupees. At the end of the entertainment the offerings she
(N&#363;r Jah&#257;n) had prepared for me were produced. Of the jewels,
jewelled ornaments, cloths and various rarities I selected what I
approved of. Altogether the cost of this great entertainment which
N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam gave was recorded to be two lacs of rupees,
exclusive of what she laid before me as offerings. In previous years,
when I was in health, I weighed 3 maunds and 1 or 2 seers more or less,
but this year, as a result of my weakness and leanness, I was only 2
maunds and 27 seers.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 1st of the Divine month of Mihr,
I&#703;tiq&#257;d K., the Governor of Kashmir, was promoted to the
mansab of 4,000 and 2,500 horse, and R&#257;ja Gaj Singh to that of
4,000 and 3,000 horse. When the news of my illness reached my son,
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z, without waiting for a farman he came to
see me, being unable to restrain himself. On the 14th<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e15686src" href="#xd24e15686" name="xd24e15686src">36</a> of
the same month (September 25, 1621), at an auspicious hour and
propitious time, that fortunate son had the good fortune to kiss the
threshold, and went three times round the couch (<i>tak&#863;ht</i>).
However much I adjured him and forbade him to do so, he insisted the
more in lamentation and importunity. I took him by the hand and drew
him towards me, and by way of kindness and affection held him fast in
an embrace, and displayed great love to him. I hope that he may enjoy a
long life with prosperity.</p>
<p class="par">At this time Rs. 20,00,000 were sent to K&#863;hurram
for the expenses of the army of the Deccan by Allah-d&#257;d K., who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb216" href="#v2pb216" name=
"v2pb216">216</a>]</span>was honoured with an elephant and a standard.
On the 28th Qiy&#257;m K., chief huntsman, died a natural death. He was
a confidential servant, and apart from his skill in hunting, looked
over every trifling detail relating to it, and consulted my pleasure in
it. In short, I was much grieved at this event. I hope that God may
grant him forgiveness.</p>
<p class="par">On the 29th the mother of N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam
died. Of the amiable qualities of this matron
(<i>Kad-b&#257;n&#363;</i>) of the family of chastity what can I write?
Without exaggeration, in purity of disposition and in wisdom and the
excellencies that are the ornament of women no Mother of the
Age<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15701src" href="#xd24e15701" name=
"xd24e15701src">37</a> was ever born equal to her, and I did not
value<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15705src" href="#xd24e15705" name=
"xd24e15705src">38</a> her less than my own mother. With regard to the
attachment that I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula bore towards her it is
certain that no husband was equal to him. Here one must imagine what
had happened to that grief-stricken old man. Also with regard to the
attachment of N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam to her mother what can one
write? A son like &#256;&#7779;af K., exceedingly intelligent and
clever, rent in pieces his robe of patience and left off the dress of
men of the social state (lit., men of dependence, or connection). At
the sight of his dear son, the grief and sorrow of the father, wounded
at heart, increased more and more. However much we admonished him, it
had no result. On the day on which I went to condole with him, as the
disturbance of his mind and grief of his heart had commenced, I spoke a
few words of admonition by way of affection and kindness, but did not
urge him. I left him until (the sense of) his calamity should abate.
After some days I ministered to his inward wound the balm of kindness,
and brought him back to the position of sociable beings. Although in
order to please me and satisfy my mind he outwardly controlled himself,
and made a show of resignation, yet with regard to his affection for
her what resignation could there be? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par">On the 1st of the Divine month of &#256;b&#257;n,
Sar-buland K., J&#257;n-sip&#257;r K., and B&#257;q&#299; K., were
honoured with the gift of drums. &#703;Abdu-llah K. had gone to his
jagir without the leave of the Subahdar<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e15717src" href="#xd24e15717" name="xd24e15717src">39</a> of the
Deccan: I accordingly told the Chief Diwans to deprive him of his
jagir, and I&#703;tim&#257;d R&#257;y was ordered to act as a
<i>saz&#257;wul</i>, and to send him back to the Deccan.</p>
<p class="par">It has been recorded with regard to the case of
Mas&#299;h&#803;u-z-zam&#257;n (H&#803;ak&#299;m &#7778;adr&#257;)
that, notwithstanding what was due from him for his bringing-up and my
kindness to him, he had not the grace to attend upon me in such an
illness, and more strange still is it that he suddenly threw off the
veil of modesty and asked for leave to undertake a journey to the
Hijaz, and make a pilgrimage to the holy house. Inasmuch as at all
times and under all circumstances the reliance of this suppliant is on
the Lord, that needs no return, and the gracious Creator, I gave him
leave with an open brow. Though he had all kinds of things (for the
journey) I made him a present of Rs. 20,000 in aid of his expenses, and
I hope that the Supreme Physician, without the assistance of physicians
and the means of medicine, may grant this suppliant complete recovery
from the Dispensary of His mercy.</p>
<p class="par">As the air of Agra, in consequence of the increase of
the temperature, did not agree with me, on Monday, the 13th of the
Divine month of &#256;b&#257;n and 16th year (of my reign), the
standards were raised to go towards the hill country of the North, so
that if the air of that quarter should be equable, I might choose some
spot of ground on the bank of the River Ganges, and found a city there,
to make a permanent place of residence for the hot weather, or else
turn the reins of purpose in the direction of Kashmir. Leaving
Muz&#804;affar K. to guard and administer Agra, I dignified him with
drums, a horse, and an elephant. Having appointed his nephew, M.
Muh&#803;ammad faujd&#257;r of the city, I gave him the title of Asad
K., and selected him for increase of mansab. Having exalted B&#257;qir
K. to the duty of the Subah of Oudh, I dismissed him. On the 26th of
the said month my prosperous son S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb218" href="#v2pb218" name=

Bihar and his jagir. I gave him leave after presenting him with a
special dress of honour, a <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i>, a jewelled dagger,
a horse, and an elephant. I hope that he may enjoy long life. On 4
&#256;z&#817;ar, Mukarram K., governor of Delhi, was exalted with the
good fortune of paying his respects. On the 6th I alighted at Delhi,
and having halted two days in Sal&#299;mgarh I employed myself with the
pleasure of sport. At this time it was reported to me that J&#257;do
R&#257;y Kaitha (or Kathiya), who is one of the leading Sardars of the
Deccan, by the guidance of good fortune and reliance on God, had
elected for loyalty, and had been enrolled amongst the loyal servants.
Bestowing on him a dress of honour and a jewelled dagger, I sent a
gracious farman to him by the hand of Nar&#257;yan D&#257;s
R&#257;thor. On the 1st of the Divine month of Dai, corresponding with
the 7th &#7778;afar, <span class="sc">A.H.</span> 1031,
Maq&#7779;&#363;d, brother of Q&#257;sim K., was honoured with the
title of H&#257;s&#863;him K. and H&#257;s&#863;him Beg
K&#863;h&#363;s&#863;h&#299;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15736src" href=

J&#257;n-nis&#804;&#257;r K.</p>
<p class="par">On the 7th of the same month the camp was pitched at
Hardw&#257;r on the bank of the Ganges. It is one of the most famous
places of worship of the Hindus, and many brahmans and recluses have
chosen a corner of retirement in this place and worship God according
to the rule of their religion. I gave alms in cash and goods to each of
them according to his requirements. As the climate of this skirt of the
hills was not approved by me, and I could not see a spot of ground on
which to make a permanent residence, I proceeded towards the skirt of
the hill country of Jammu and K&#257;ngra.</p>
<p class="par">At this time it was reported to me that R&#257;ja
Bh&#257;o Singh had died in the Deccan (become a traveller on the road
of non-existence). From excess of wine-drinking he had become very weak
and low. Suddenly a faintness came over him. However much the
physicians tried remedies for him and burnt scars on the top of his
head, he did not come to his senses: for a night and a day he lay
without perception, and died the next day. Two wives and eight
concubines burnt themselves in the fire of fidelity for him. Jagat
Singh, his elder brother, and Mah&#257; Singh, his nephew, had spent
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb219" href="#v2pb219" name=
"v2pb219">219</a>]</span>coin of their lives in the wine-business, and
the aforesaid, not taking warning from them, sold sweet life for bitter
fluid. He was of very good disposition and sedate. From the days when I
was a prince he was constantly in my service, and by the blessing of my
education had reached the high rank of 5,000. As he left no son, I
dignified the grandson of his elder brother, though of tender years,
with the title of Raja, and gave him the mansab of 2,000 personal and
1,000 horse. The pargana of Amber, his native place, was assigned to
him as jagir, according to former custom, in order that his family
might not be dispersed. A&#7779;&#257;lat K., s. K&#863;h&#257;n
Jah&#257;n, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse.
On the 20th<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15748src" href="#xd24e15748"
name="xd24e15748src">41</a> of the same month I halted at the saray of
Alw&#257;t&#363;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15751src" href=
"#xd24e15751" name="xd24e15751src">42</a> As I am constantly engaged in
the pleasure of hunting, and the flesh of animals I have killed with my
own hand is very much to my taste, in consequence of the suspicions and
caution that I have in such matters, I order them to be cleaned in my
presence, and myself inspect their stomachs to see what they have eaten
and what the food of the animals is. If by chance I see anything to
which I have a dislike I forbear from eating the flesh. Before this I
was not inclined towards any kind of waterfowl except the <i>sona</i>
(golden duck?). When I was at Ajmir I saw a tame <i>sona</i> duck
eating horrible worms. From seeing this, my taste turned against it,
and I gave up eating tame <i>sona</i> ducks until now, when a duck was
caught, and I ordered them to clean it in my presence. From its crop
there first came out a small<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15764src" href=
"#xd24e15764" name="xd24e15764src">43</a> fish: after this there
appeared a bug<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15773src" href="#xd24e15773"
name="xd24e15773src">44</a> so large that I could not believe till I
saw it with my own eye that it could swallow a thing of such a size.
Briefly I this day determined that I would not eat waterfowl.
K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam represented that the flesh of the white
heron (<i>&#703;uq&#257;b-i-saf&#299;d</i>) was very delicious and
tender. I accordingly sent for a white heron, and ordered them to clean
it in my presence. By chance there came out of its crop ten
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb220" href="#v2pb220" name=

remembrance of which I am distressed and disgusted.</p>
<p class="par">On the 21st the garden of Sirhind brought joy to my
senses, and on the day of halt there I delighted myself by going round
and looking at it. At this time K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan came from the Deccan, and had the good fortune
to wait on me. He had great favour shown him. On the 1st of the Divine
month of Bahman I halted at N&#363;r-Sar&#257;y.<a class="noteref" id=

made governor of Allahabad,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15787src" href=

Muqarrab K. was selected for the mansab of 5,000 personal and horse. On
Thursday, when I was encamped on the bank of the Biy&#257;h
(Be&#257;s), Q&#257;sim K. came from Lahore, and had the good fortune
to wait on me. H&#257;s&#863;him K., his brother, with the Zamindars of
the country bordering on the hills, had the honour of kissing the
threshold.</p>
<p class="par">B&#257;so&#702;&#299;,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e15792src" href="#xd24e15792" name="xd24e15792src">47</a> the
zamindar of Talw&#257;ra, brought me a bird, which the hill-people call
<i>j&#257;n-bahan</i>. Its tail resembles the tail of the
<i>qirq&#257;wul</i> (pheasant), which is also called the
<i>tazr&#363;</i>, and its colour is exactly like that of the
hen-pheasant, but it is half as large again. The circle round the eyes
of this bird is red, while the orbit of the pheasant is white. The said
B&#257;so&#702;&#299; stated that this bird lived in the
snow-mountains, and that its food was grass and other stuff. I have
kept pheasants and have reared young ones, and have often eaten the
flesh both of young birds and of mature ones. One may say that there is
no comparison between the flesh of the pheasant and this bird. The
flesh of the latter is much more delicate. Among the birds which I saw
in the hill-country one was the <i>ph&#363;l-paik&#257;r</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e15808src" href="#xd24e15808" name=
"xd24e15808src">48</a> which the Kashmiris call <i>sonl&#363;</i>. It
is one-eighth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb221" href="#v2pb221"

less than a pea-hen. The back, tail, and wings resemble those of the
bustard, and are blackish, with white spots. The breast to the end of
the bosom is black, with white spots, and some red ones. The ends of
the feathers are fiery red, and very lustrous and beautiful. From the
end of the back of the neck it is also brilliantly black. On the top of
its head it has two fleshy horns of a turquoise colour. The skin of its
orbits and round its mouth is red. Below its throat there is skin round
it enough to cover the palms of two hands, and in the middle of this
the skin is of a violet colour of the size of a hand, with blue spots
in the middle. Around it each streak is of a blue colour, consisting of
eight plumes; round the blue streak it is red to the breadth of two
fingers, like the peach flower, and again round its neck is that
blue-coloured streak: it has red legs also. The live bird, which was
weighed, came to 152 tolahs. After it was killed and cleaned it weighed
139 tolahs. Another bird is of a golden colour: this the people of
Lahore call <i>S&#863;han</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e15824src"
href="#xd24e15824" name="xd24e15824src">49</a> (?) and the Kashmiris
<i>p&#363;t&#804;</i>. Its colour is like that of a peacock&rsquo;s
breast. Above its head is a tuft (<i>k&#257;kul</i>). Its tail of the
width of five fingers is yellow, and is like the long feather
(<i>s&#863;hah-par</i>) of the peacock, and its body as large as that
of a goose. The neck of the goose is long and shapeless: that of this
one is short, and has a shape.</p>
<p class="par">My brother, S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s, had asked
for golden birds,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15848src" href=
"#xd24e15848" name="xd24e15848src">50</a> and I sent some to him by his
ambassador. On Monday<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15853src" href=
"#xd24e15853" name="xd24e15853src">51</a> the ceremony of my lunar
weighing took place. At this entertainment N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam
gave dresses of honour to forty-five of the great Amirs and private
servants. On the 14th of the same month the camp was pitched at the
village of Bahlwan<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15856src" href=
"#xd24e15856" name="xd24e15856src">52</a> belonging to the

above-mentioned, I left the large camp at this place, and proceeded to
inspect the said fort with some of my special servants and attendants.
As I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula was ill I left him in the camp, and kept
&#7778;&#257;diq K., the chief Bakhshi, there to look after him and
guard the camp. The next day news came that his state had undergone a
change, and that the signs of hopelessness were apparent. I could not
bear the agitation of N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam, and, considering the
affection which I bore towards him, I returned to the camp. At the end
of the day I went to see him. It was the hour of his death agony.
Sometimes he became unconscious and sometimes came back to his senses.
N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam indicated me, and said: &ldquo;Do you
recognise (him)?&rdquo; At such a time he recited this couplet of
Anwar&#299;:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Were a mother-born blind man present</p>
<p class="line">He&rsquo;d recognise Majesty in the World-Adorner.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">I was for two hours at his pillow. Whenever he was
conscious, whatever he said was intelligent and rational. In fine, on
the 17th of the said month (Bahman) (about the end of January, 1622),
after three gharis had passed he attained to eternal mercy. What shall
I say about my feelings through this terrible event? He was a wise and
perfect Vizier, and a learned and affectionate companion.</p>

shoulders, and it is not possible for or within the power of a mortal
to make everyone contented, yet no one ever went to
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula with a petition or on business who turned
from him in an injured frame of mind. He showed loyalty to the
sovereign, and yet left pleased and hopeful him who was in need. In
fact, this was a speciality of his. From the day on which his companion
(his wife) attained to the mercy of God he cared no longer for himself,
but melted away from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb223" href=
"#v2pb223" name="v2pb223">223</a>]</span>day to day. Although outwardly
he looked after the affairs of the kingdom, and taking pains with the
ordering of civil matters, did not withdraw his hand from business, yet
in his heart he grieved at the separation, and at last, after three
months and twenty days, he passed away. The next day I went to condole
with his sons and sons-in-law, and, presenting 41 of his children and
connections and 12 of his dependents with dresses of honour, I took
them out of their mourning garments.</p>
<p class="par">The next day I marched with the same purpose (as
before), and went to see the fort of K&#257;ngra. In four stages the
camp was pitched at the river B&#257;nganga. Alf K. and
S&#863;haik&#863;h Faiz&#803;u-llah, the guards of the fort, had the
good fortune to pay their respects. At this stage the offering of the
Raja of Chamba<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15890src" href="#xd24e15890"
name="xd24e15890src">54</a> was laid before me. His country is 25 koss
beyond K&#257;ngra. There is no greater Zamindari in these hills than
this. The country is the asylum of all the Zamindars of the country. It
has passes (<i>&#703;aqabah&#257;</i>) difficult to cross. Until now he
had not obeyed any king nor sent offerings. His brother also was
honoured by paying his respects, and on his part performed the dues of
service and loyalty. He seemed to me to be reasonable and intelligent
and urbane. I exalted him with all kinds of patronage and favour.</p>
<p class="par">On the 24th<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15899src" href=
"#xd24e15899" name="xd24e15899src">55</a> of the same month I went to
see the fort of K&#257;ngra, and gave an order that the
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299;, the Chief Justice (<i>M&#299;r &#703;Adl</i>),
and other learned men of Islam should accompany me and carry out in the
fort whatever was customary, according to the religion of
Muh&#803;ammad. Briefly, having traversed about one koss, I went up to
the top of the fort, and by the grace of God, the call to prayer and
the reading of the <i>K&#863;hut&#804;ba</i> and the slaughter of a
bullock, which had not taken place from the commencement of the
building of the fort till now, were carried out in my presence. I
prostrated myself in thanksgiving for this great gift, which no king
had hoped to receive, and ordered a lofty mosque to be built inside the
fort. The fort of K&#257;ngra is situated on a high hill, and is so
strong that if furnished with provisions and the necessaries for a fort
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb224" href="#v2pb224" name=
"v2pb224">224</a>]</span>the hand of force cannot reach its skirt, and
the noose of stratagem must fall short of it. Although there are
heights (<i>sar-k&#363;bh&#257;</i>) in some places, and guns and
muskets might reach (the fort) from them, yet no harm would accrue to
the garrison, for they could move to another part of the fort,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e15914src" href="#xd24e15914" name=
"xd24e15914src">56</a> and be safe. It has 23 bastions and seven gates.
Its inner circumference is 1 koss and 15 ropes, its length is &frac14;
koss and 2 ropes (<i>t&#804;an&#257;b</i>), its breadth not more than
22 ropes nor less than 15. Its height is 114 cubits. There are two
reservoirs inside the fort, one 2 ropes long and 1&frac12; broad; the
other is of the same length (?).<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15920src"
href="#xd24e15920" name="xd24e15920src">57</a></p>
<p class="par">After going round the fort I went to see the temple of
Durg&#257;, which is known as Bhawan.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e15925src" href="#xd24e15925" name="xd24e15925src">58</a> A world
has here wandered in the desert of error. Setting aside the infidels
whose custom is the worship of idols, crowds on crowds of the people of
Islam, traversing long distances, bring their offerings and pray to the
black stone (image). Near the temple, and on the slope of the hill
there is a sulphur-mine (<i>k&#257;n</i>), and its heat causes flames
to continually burst forth. They call it Jw&#257;l&#257;
Mukh&#299;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15931src" href="#xd24e15931"
name="xd24e15931src">59</a> (Flame-Face or Burning Mouth), and regard
it as one of the idol&rsquo;s miracles. In fact, Hindus, while knowing
the truth,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15943src" href="#xd24e15943"
name="xd24e15943src">60</a> deceive the common people. Hindus
say<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15948src" href="#xd24e15948" name=
"xd24e15948src">61</a> that when the life of Mah&#257;deo&rsquo;s wife
came to an end and she drank the draught of death, Mah&#257;deo, in his
great love and attachment <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb225" href=
"#v2pb225" name="v2pb225">225</a>]</span>to her, took her dead body on
his back, and went about the world carrying her corpse. When some time
had passed in this manner, her form dissolved and dropped asunder, and
each limb fell in a different place: they give honour and dignity to
the place according to the dignity and grace of the member. As the
breast, which when compared with other members has the greatest
dignity, fell in this place, they hold it more precious than any other.
Some maintain that this stone, which is now a place of worship for the
vile infidels, is not the stone which was there originally, but that a
body of the people<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15954src" href=
"#xd24e15954" name="xd24e15954src">62</a> of Islam came and carried off
the original stone, and threw it into the bottom of the river, with the
intent that no one could get at it. For a long time the tumult of the
infidels and idol-worshippers had died away in the world, till a lying
brahman hid a stone for his own ends, and going to the Raja of the time
said: &ldquo;I saw Durg&#257; in a dream, and she said to me:
&lsquo;They have thrown me into a certain place: quickly go and take me
up.&rsquo;&rdquo; The Raja, in the simplicity of his heart, and greedy
for the offerings of gold that would come to him, accepted the tale of
the brahman, and sent a number of people with him, and brought that
stone, and kept it in this place with honour, and started again the
shop of error and misleading. But God only knows!</p>
<p class="par">From the temple I went to see the valley which is known
as K&#363;h-i-Mad&#257;r.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15959src" href=
"#xd24e15959" name="xd24e15959src">63</a> It is a delightful place.
From its climate, the freshness of its verdure, and its delightful
position it is a place of pleasure worthy to be seen. There is a
waterfall here which pours down water from the top of the hill. I
ordered them to put up a symmetrical building there. On the 25th
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb226" href="#v2pb226" name=
"v2pb226">226</a>]</span>of the month the standards were turned back to
return. Having presented Alf K. and S&#863;haik&#863;h Faiz&#803;u-llah
with horses and elephants I left them to defend the fort. Next day I
encamped at the fort of N&#363;rp&#363;r.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e15967src" href="#xd24e15967" name="xd24e15967src">64</a> It was
reported to me that in this neighbourhood there were many jungle fowl.
As I had never yet caught these, I made a halt of another day, and
enjoyed myself with the sport, having caught four. One cannot
distinguish them in shape and colour from domestic fowls. One of the
peculiarities of these birds is that if they are caught by the feet and
turned upside down, wherever they are taken they make no sound, and
remain silent, contrary to the domestic fowl, which makes an outcry.
Until the domestic fowl is plunged into hot water its feathers do not
come off easily. The jungle fowl, like the partridge and
<i>podna</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15973src" href="#xd24e15973"
name="xd24e15973src">65</a> can be plucked when dry. I ordered them to
roast them. It was found that the flesh of the full-grown ones was very
tasteless and dry. The chickens had some juiciness, but were not good
to eat. They cannot fly farther than a bow-shot. The cock<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e15982src" href="#xd24e15982" name=
"xd24e15982src">66</a> is chiefly red, and the hen black and yellow.
There are many in this N&#363;rp&#363;r jungle. The ancient name of
N&#363;rp&#363;r is Dhamer&#299;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e15991src"
href="#xd24e15991" name="xd24e15991src">67</a> Since R&#257;ja
B&#257;so built the fort and made houses and gardens they call it
N&#363;rp&#363;r, after my name. About Rs. 30,000 were expended on the
building. Certes, the buildings Hindus construct after their fashion,
however much they decorate them, are not pleasant. As the place was fit
and the locality enchanting, I ordered them to spend Rs. 1,00,000 out
of the public treasury, and to erect buildings at it, and to make lofty
edifices suited to the spot.</p>
<p class="par">At this time it was reported to me that there was a
<i>Sanny&#257;s&#299; Mot&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e15998src" href="#xd24e15998" name="xd24e15998src">68</a> in the
neighbourhood who had entirely renounced <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb227" href="#v2pb227" name="v2pb227">227</a>]</span>control over
himself. I ordered them to bring him that I might ascertain the real
state of affairs. They call Hindu devotees <i>Sarb
b&#257;s&#299;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16022src" href=
"#xd24e16022" name="xd24e16022src">69</a> By usage the word has become
<i>San-ny&#257;s&#299;</i> (laying down everything). There are many
degrees among them, and there are several orders among the Sarb
b&#257;s&#299;. Among them there is the <i>Mot&#299;</i> order. They
put themselves into the figure of a cross (?) (<i>&#7779;alb
ik&#863;htiy&#257;r m&#299;kunand</i>) and surrender themselves
(<i>tasl&#299;m</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e16045src" href=
"#xd24e16045" name="xd24e16045src">70</a> <i>m&#299;s&#257;zand</i>).
For instance, they never speak. If for ten days and nights they stand
in one place, they do not move their feet forwards or backwards; in
fact, make no movement at all, and remain like fossils. When he came
into my presence I examined him, and found a wonderful state of
persistence. It occurred to me that in a state of drunkenness and
absence of mind and delirium, some change might be wrought in him.
Accordingly I ordered them to give him some cups of spirit
(<i>&#703;araq</i>) of double strength. This was done in royal fashion
(liberally?), but not the least change took place, and he remained in
the same impassive state. At last his senses left him, and they carried
him out like a corpse. God Almighty granted him mercy so that he did
not lose his life. Certainly there was great persistence in his
nature.</p>
<p class="par">At this time B&#299;-badal K. presented me with the
chronogram of the conquest of K&#257;ngra, and that of the foundation
of the mosque which I had ordered. As he had hit it off well, I here
record it:</p>

Deccanis is in some places rather obscurely worded, and the printed
edition is not always correct. Help can be obtained from the
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, 181, etc., and from Elliot, VI. 379. The text has
<i>fir&#257;r</i>, &ldquo;flight,&rdquo; and this has been followed by
Elliot, who has &ldquo;on their approach the rebels took to flight, and
removed to a distance from Burhanpur.&rdquo; But the true reading, as
shown by the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, is <i>qar&#257;r</i>,
&ldquo;firmness,&rdquo; not <i>fir&#257;r</i>, and the words are <i>bar
daur-i-s&#863;hahr</i>, &ldquo;round the city,&rdquo; not <i>bar
d&#363;r</i>, &ldquo;far from.&rdquo; The rebels were, as the
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma states, &ldquo;in the environs of the city,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>dar saw&#257;d-i-s&#863;hahr</i>,&rdquo; but apparently not
in such force as to prevent S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s
<i>saz&#257;wuls</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, his apparitors and
summoners&mdash;from going into the city and bringing out

<p class="par first">On the eve of Monday, the &mdash;&mdash;,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e16145src" href="#xd24e16145" name=
"xd24e16145src">1</a> of the month of Jum&#257;da-l-awwal, <span class=
"sc">A.H.</span> 1031, March 10&ndash;12, 1622, after one watch, five
gharis and a fraction had passed, the sun that illuminates the world
lighted the mansion of Aries, and the 17th year of the reign of this
suppliant began auspiciously and happily. On this joy-increasing day
&#256;&#7779;af K. was promoted to the mansab of 6,000 personal and
horse. Having given Q&#257;sim K. leave to proceed to the government of
the Panjab, I presented him with a horse, an elephant, and a dress of
honour. Eighty thousand darbs were given to Zambil Beg, ambassador of
the ruler of Persia. On the 6th of the same month (Farward&#299;n) the
royal camp was at R&#257;walpind&#299;. F&#257;z&#803;il K. was
promoted to the post of Bakhshi. Zamb&#299;l Beg was ordered to remain
at ease in Lahore until the return of the victorious army from Kashmir.
An elephant was conferred on Akbarqul&#299; K. Gakkar.</p>
<p class="par">At this time I frequently heard that the ruler of Persia
had hastened from Khurasan for the purpose of conquering Qandahar.
Although looking to our previous and present connections, it appeared
very unlikely, and beyond all calculation, that such a great king
should entertain such light and crude ideas, and himself come against
one of my humble slaves who was in Qandahar with 300 or 400<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e16153src" href="#xd24e16153" name=
"xd24e16153src">2</a> servants, yet as <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb231" href="#v2pb231" name="v2pb231">231</a>]</span>caution is one
of the duties of a ruler and becoming to a king, I sent
Zainu-l-&#703;&#256;bid&#299;n, Bakhshi of <i>Ah&#803;ad&#299;s</i>,
with a gracious farman to K&#863;hurram to come and wait on me with all
possible speed with a victorious host, and elephants of mountain
hugeness, and the numerous artillery that were assigned for his support
in that Subah. So that, if these words should be near the truth, he
might come and be despatched with an innumerable army and countless
treasure, in order that he (the king of Persia) might discover the
result of breaking faith and of wrong-doing.</p>
<p class="par">On the 8th I halted at the fountain of H&#803;asan
Abd&#257;l. Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K. was promoted to the mansab of
2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, and Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n was
appointed Bakhshi of the Ah&#803;ad&#299;s. On Friday, the 12th,
Mah&#257;bat K., having come from Kabul, waited on me and had the good
fortune to pay his respects, and became the recipient of
daily-increasing favours. He presented 100 muhrs as a present and Rs.
10,000 as alms. K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan passed his
followers before me in review; 2,500 well-horsed cavalry were enrolled
of whom 400 were matchlock men. At this stage a <i>qamurg&#863;ha</i>
hunt was arranged, and I shot<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16166src"
href="#xd24e16166" name="xd24e16166src">3</a> 33 hill
<i>q&#363;chq&#257;r</i> (mountain sheep), etc. At this time
H&#803;ak&#299;m M&#363;min&#257;, at the recommendation of the pillar
of the State, Mah&#257;bat K., had the good fortune to wait on me. With
power and courage he undertook my cure, and I hope that his coming may
prove auspicious to me. The mansab of Am&#257;nu-llah, s. Mah&#257;bat
K., was fixed at 2,000 personal and 1,800 horse. On the 19th I encamped
near Pakhl&#299;, and the feast of the culmination was held there.
Having given Mah&#257;bat K. leave to return to Kabul, I gave him a
horse, an elephant, and a dress of honour. The mansab of
I&#703;tib&#257;r K. was ordered to be 5,000 personal and 4,000 horse.
As he was an old servant, and had become very weak and old, I promoted
him to the Subah of Agra, and entrusted to him the defence of the fort
and the treasury, and, presenting him with an elephant, a horse, and a
dress of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb232" href="#v2pb232" name=
"v2pb232">232</a>]</span>honour, dismissed him. At the Pass of
Kunwar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16177src" href="#xd24e16177" name=
"xd24e16177src">4</a> Mast, Ir&#257;dat K. came from Kashmir, and had
the good fortune to kiss the threshold. On the 2nd of the Divine month
of Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, I entered the enchanting region of Kashmir.
M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n was promoted to the mansab of 2,500 personal
and 1,400 horse. At this time, in order to ease the condition of the
ryots and soldiery, I did away with the faujd&#257;ri cess, and gave an
order that in the whole of my dominions they should not impose anything
on account of faujd&#257;ri. Zabar-dast K., Master of the Ceremonies
(M&#299;r T&#363;zuk), was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and
700 horse. On the 13th, by the advice of the physicians, and especially
of H&#803;ak&#299;m M&#363;min&#257;, I was lightened by being bled
from my left leg. A present of a dress of honour was made to Muqarrab
K., and one of 1,000 darbs to H&#803;ak&#299;m M&#363;min&#257;. At the
request of K&#863;hurram the mansab of &#703;Abdu-llah K. was fixed at
6,000. Sar-far&#257;z<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16181src" href=
"#xd24e16181" name="xd24e16181src">5</a> K. was honoured with the gift
of drums. Bah&#257;dur K. Uzbeg, having come from Qandahar, had the
good fortune to pay his respects: by way of nazar he gave 100 muhrs,
and by way of charity offered Rs. 4,000. Mu&#7779;&#7789;af&#257; K.,
governor of Thatta, had sent as an offering a S&#863;h&#257;h-n&#257;ma
and a K&#863;hamsa (quintet) of S&#863;haik&#863;h
Niz&#804;&#257;m&#299; illustrated by masters (of painting), along with
other presents: these were laid before me. On the 1st of the Divine
month of K&#863;hurd&#257;d Las&#863;hkar K. was exalted to the mansab
of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse, and to M&#299;r Jumla was given that
of 2,500 personal and 1,000 horse. Some of the Amirs of the Deccan were
similarly honoured with an increase of mansab. Promotion was also given
as follows: Sard&#257;r K., 3,000 and 2,500 horse; Sar-buland K., 2,500
personal and 2,200 horse; B&#257;q&#299; K., 2,500 and 2,000 horse;
S&#863;harza K., 2,500 and 1,200 horse; J&#257;n-sip&#257;r K., 2,000
personal and 2,000 horse; M&#299;rz&#257; W&#257;l&#299;, 2,500 and

M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, 1,500 personal and horse;
Z&#257;hid K., 1,500 and 700 horse; &#703;Aq&#299;dat K., 1,200 and 300
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb233" href="#v2pb233" name=

K&#257;s&#863;hg&#863;har&#299;, 1,200 and 600 horse; and
Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r K., 1,000 personal and 500 horse. R&#257;ja
Gaj Singh and Himmat K. were selected for drums. On the 2nd of the
Divine month of T&#299;r, Sayyid B&#257;yaz&#299;d was honoured with
the title of Mu&#7779;t&#804;af&#257; K., and was also presented with
drums. At this time Tahawwur K., who is one of the personal servants,
was despatched with a gracious farman to summon my fortunate son
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z.</p>
<p class="par">Some days before this, petitions came from the officials
in Qandahar reporting the intention of the ruler of Persia to conquer
Qandahar, but my mind, which is actuated by sincerity, looking to past
and present relations, placed no reliance on the truth of this until
the report of my son K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n arrived that
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s, with the armies of Iraq and Khurasan,
had come and besieged Qandahar. I ordered them to fix an hour for
leaving Kashmir. Khw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan, the Diwan, and
Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; &#7778;&#257;diq K. hastened to Lahore in
advance of the victorious army to expedite the arrival of the princes
of high degree with the armies of the Deccan, Gujarat, Bengal, and
Behar, and to send on the Amirs who were present with the victorious
stirrups, and those who one after another should come in from the
districts of their jagirs to my son K&#863;han J&#257;h&#257;n at
Multan. At the same time the artillery, with the strings of warlike
elephants, and the armoury<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16188src" href=
"#xd24e16188" name="xd24e16188src">6</a> were to be prepared and
forwarded. As there was little cultivation between Multan and Qandahar,
the despatch of a large army without provisions was not to be thought
of. It was therefore decided to encourage the grain-sellers, who in the
language of India are called <i>banj&#257;r&#257;</i>, and, providing
them with money, to take them along with the victorious army, so that
there might be no difficulty about supplies. The
Banj&#257;r&#257;s<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16194src" href=
"#xd24e16194" name="xd24e16194src">7</a> are a tribe. Some of them have
1,000 bullocks, and some more or less. They take grain from different
districts (<i>bul&#363;k&#257;t</i>) into the towns and sell it. They
go along with the armies, and with such an army there would be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb234" href="#v2pb234" name=
"v2pb234">234</a>]</span>100,000 bullocks or more. It is hoped that by
the grace of the Creator, the army will be furnished with numbers and
arms so that there may be no delay or hesitation until it <span class=
"corr" id="xd24e16206" title="Source: reach">reaches</span>
Isf&#257;han, which is his (the Shah&rsquo;s) capital. A farman was
sent to K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n to beware and not start in that
direction (Qandahar) from Multan before the arrival of the victorious
army, and not be disturbed, but attend to orders. Bah&#257;dur K. Uzbeg
was selected to go as an auxiliary to the army of Qandahar, and
favoured with a horse and dress of honour. F&#257;z&#803;il K. was
given the mansab of 2,000 personal and 750 horse.</p>
<p class="par">As it had been brought to notice that the poor of
Kashmir suffer hardships in the winter from the excessive cold, and
live with difficulty, I ordered that a village of the rental of Rs.
3,000 or Rs. 4,000 should be entrusted to Mull&#257; T&#804;&#257;lib
I&#7779;fah&#257;n&#299;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16211src" href=
"#xd24e16211" name="xd24e16211src">8</a> to be expended in providing
clothes for the poor, and for warming water, for purposes of ablution,
in the mosques.</p>
<p class="par">As it was reported that the Zamindars of Kishtwar had
again raised their heads in disobedience and sin, and engaged in
sedition and disturbance, Ir&#257;dat K. was ordered to proceed
hot-foot, before they had time to establish themselves firmly, and
having inflicted condign punishment on them to tear up the root of
sedition. On this day Zainu-l-&#703;&#256;bid&#299;n, who had been sent
to summon K&#863;hurram, came and waited on me, and reported that the
stipulation he made was that he should pass the rainy season in the
fort of M&#257;nd&#363;, and then come to Court. His report was read.
I<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16216src" href="#xd24e16216" name=
"xd24e16216src">9</a> did not like the style of its purport nor the
request he made, and, on the contrary, the traces of disloyalty
(<i>b&#299;-daulat&#299;</i>) were apparent. There being no remedy, an
order was given that as he proposed to come after the rains, he should
despatch the great Amirs, the servants of the Court who were employed
in assisting him, and especially the Sayyids of B&#257;rha and Bukhara,
the S&#863;haik&#863;h-z&#257;das, the Afghans, and the Rajputs.
M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam and I&#703;tiq&#257;d K. were ordered to go to
Lahore in advance, and assist the army <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb235" href="#v2pb235" name="v2pb235">235</a>]</span>of Qandahar.
Rs. l,00,000 were given them as advance of pay, and I also granted
drums to &#703;In&#257;yat K. and I&#703;tim&#257;d K. Ir&#257;dat K.,
who had hastened to punish the rebels of Kishtwar, having killed many
of them and regained the mastery and established himself firmly,
returned to duty. Mu&#703;tamid K. had been appointed
Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; to the army of the Deccan. As that matter was
over<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16224src" href="#xd24e16224" name=
"xd24e16224src">10</a> he was sent for at his own request. He came on
this day, and on his arrival kissed the threshold.</p>
<p class="par">It is a strange thing that when a pearl of the value of
Rs. 14,000 or 15,000 was lost in the harem, Jotik R&#257;y, the
astrologer, represented that it would be found in two or three days.
&#7778;&#257;diq K. Ramm&#257;l (soothsayer) represented that in the
same two or three days it would come from a place which was perfectly
clean and pure, such as the place of worship or oratory. A female
soothsayer represented that it would soon be found, and that a woman
with white skin would bring it in a state of ecstasy, and give it into
the hand of the H&#803;az&#803;rat (the king). It happened that on the
third day one of the Turkish girls found it in the oratory, and all in
smiles and in a happy frame of mind gave it to me. As the words of all
three came true each one was favoured with an acceptable reward. This
is written because it is not devoid of strangeness.</p>
<p class="par">At this time I appointed Kaukab and
K&#863;hidmatg&#257;r K., and others to the number of twelve in all, of
the familiar servants to be <i>saz&#257;wuls</i> of the Amirs in the
Deccan in order that they might exert themselves and send them forward
as soon as possible to Court, so that they (the Am&#299;rs) might be
sent to the victorious army at Qandahar.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e16234src" href="#xd24e16234" name="xd24e16234src">11</a> At this
time it was frequently reported to me that K&#863;hurram had taken into
his possession some of the estates of the jagir of N&#363;r Jah&#257;n
Begam and S&#863;hahriy&#257;r, and especially the pargana of Dholpur,
which had by the High Diwan been assigned to S&#863;hahriy&#257;r,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb236" href="#v2pb236" name=
"v2pb236">236</a>]</span>and had sent there an Afghan of the name of
Dary&#257;, one of his own servants, with a body of men. Dary&#257;
fought with S&#863;har&#299;fu-l-mulk, a servant of
S&#863;hahriy&#257;r, who had been appointed to the faujd&#257;ri of
that region, and many were killed on both sides. Although in
consequence of his (K&#863;hurram&rsquo;s) remaining in the fort of
M&#257;nd&#363;, and the unreasonable requests made in his letter it
appeared that his reason was turned, yet from hearing this news it
became clear that he was unworthy of all the favours and cherishing I
had bestowed on him, and that his brain had gone wrong. Accordingly I
sent R&#257;ja R&#363;z-afz&#363;n, who was a confidential servant, to
him, and made inquiries as to the cause of this boldness. He was
ordered hereafter to behave properly, and not place his foot beyond the
path of reasonableness and the high road of politeness, and content
himself with the districts of his own jagir that he had obtained from
the High Diwan. He must also beware not to form any intention of coming
to wait upon me, but to send the body of the servants of the State I
had requisitioned on account of the disturbance at Qandahar to the
Court. If anything contrary to this order should come to notice, he
would repent it.</p>
<p class="par">At this time M&#299;r Z&#804;ah&#299;ru-d-d&#299;n, the
grandson of M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n, s. the famous S&#863;h&#257;h
Ni&#703;matu-llah, came from Persia and waited on me, and received as a
present a dress of honour and 8,000 darbs. Uj&#257;l&#257; Dakhan&#299;
obtained leave to go to R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo with a gracious
farman in order that he should act as <i>saz&#257;wul</i> and collect
the men. Previously to this, on account of the great regard and
abundant affection I bore to K&#863;hurram and his sons, at the time
when his son (S&#863;huj&#257;&#703;) was very ill, I had determined
that if God Almighty would grant him to me I would not again sport with
a gun, and would inflict no injury on a living thing with my own hand.
Notwithstanding my inclination and love for hunting, especially with a
gun, I had given it up for five years. At this time, when I was greatly
distressed at his unkind behaviour, I took again to sporting with a
gun, and gave orders that nobody should remain in the palace without
one. In a short time most of the servants took a liking to shooting
with guns, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb237" href=
"#v2pb237" name="v2pb237">237</a>]</span>archers,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e16246src" href="#xd24e16246" name="xd24e16246src">12</a> in order
to perform their duties, became cavalry soldiers.</p>
<p class="par">On the 25th of the month, corresponding with the 7th
S&#863;haww&#257;l, at the favourable hour that had been chosen, I
turned towards Lahore from Kashmir (apparently means Srinagar, the
capital). I sent Bih&#257;r&#299; D&#257;s Brahman with a gracious
farman to R&#257;n&#257; Karan to the effect that he should bring his
son with a body of men to pay his respects to me. M&#299;r
Z&#804;ah&#299;ru-d-d&#299;n was promoted to the mansab of 1,000
personal and 400 horse. As he represented to me that he was in debt, I
made him a present of Rs. 10,000. On the 1st of S&#863;hahr&#299;war I
encamped at the fountain of Achbal,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e16259src" href="#xd24e16259" name="xd24e16259src">13</a> and on
Thursday I had a feast of cups beside the fountain.<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e16262src" href="#xd24e16262" name="xd24e16262src">14</a> On
this auspicious day my fortunate son S&#863;hahriy&#257;r was appointed
to the Qandahar expedition, and was promoted to the mansab of 12,000
personal and 8,000 horse. A special dress of honour, with a
<i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> with pearl buttons, was also given him. At this
time a merchant had brought two large pearls from the country of
Turkey, one of them weighing 1&frac14; <i>mis&#804;q&#257;ls</i>, and
the second 1 <i>surk&#863;h</i> less. N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam bought
the two for Rs. 60,000, and presented them to me as an offering on the
same day. On Friday, the 10th, by the advice of H&#803;ak&#299;m
M&#363;min&#257;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16275src" href=
"#xd24e16275" name="xd24e16275src">15</a> I was relieved by bleeding
from the arm. Muqarrab K., who has great skill in this art, always used
to bleed me, and possibly never failed before, but now failed twice.
Afterwards Q&#257;sim, his nephew, bled me. I gave him a dress of
honour and Rs. 2,000, and gave 1,000 darbs to H&#803;ak&#299;m

<p class="par">On the 21st of the month the feast of my solar weighing
took place, and the 54th year of the age of this suppliant at the
throne of God began auspiciously and happily. I hope that the whole of
my life will be spent in fulfilling the will of God. On the 28th, I
went to see the waterfall of Ashar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16282src"
href="#xd24e16282" name="xd24e16282src">16</a> (?). As this spring is
famous for its sweetness and agreeable flavour, I weighed it in my
presence against Ganges water, and that<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e16285src" href="#xd24e16285" name="xd24e16285src">17</a> of the
valley of L&#257;r. The water of Ashar was 3 <i>m&#257;s&#863;ha</i>
heavier than that of the Ganges, and the latter was &frac12;
<i>m&#257;s&#863;ha</i> lighter than that of the valley of L&#257;r. On
the 30th the camp was at H&#299;r&#257;p&#363;r. Though Ir&#257;dat K.
had done his duty in Kishtwar well, yet as the ryots and inhabitants of
Kashmir complained of his treatment of them, I promoted
I&#703;tiq&#257;d K. to the governorship of Kashmir. I bestowed on him
a horse, a dress of honour, and a special enemy-piercing<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e16297src" href="#xd24e16297" name=
"xd24e16297src">18</a> sword, and appointed Ir&#257;dat K. to do duty
with the army of Qandahar. Having brought Kunwar Singh, the Raja of
Kishtwar, out of the fortress of Gwalior, where he was imprisoned, I
bestowed Kishtwar on him, and gave him a horse and a dress of honour,
with the title of Raja. I sent H&#803;aidar Malik to Kashmir
(<i>i.e.</i>, Srinagar) to bring a canal from the valley of L&#257;r to
the N&#363;r-afz&#257; garden, giving him Rs. 30,000 for the materials
and labour. On the 12th of the month I came down from the hill country
of Jamm&#363;, and pitched at Bhimbhar. The next day I had a
<i>qamurqha</i> hunt. To D&#257;war-bak&#863;hs&#863;h, s.
K&#863;husrau, I gave the mansab of 5,000 personal and 2,000 horse. On
the 24th I crossed the Chenab.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16310src"

K. Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;, who had hastened to Lahore to make
provision for the army of Qandahar, had the good fortune to kiss the
threshold. On the 1st of the Divine month of &#256;b&#257;n,
Am&#257;nu-llah, s. Mah&#257;bat K., was promoted to the mansab of
3,000 personal and 1,700 horse. A gracious farman was sent to summon
Mah&#257;bat K. At this time &#703;Abdu-llah K., whom I had sent for
for service at Qandahar, having come from the district of his jagir,
paid his respects. On the 4th of the same month I entered the city of
Lahore auspiciously and happily. Alf K. was promoted to the mansab of
2,000 and 1,500 horse. I gave<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16322src"
href="#xd24e16322" name="xd24e16322src">22</a> an order to the chief
Diwans to levy the pay of the force of servants of the State who had
been appointed for service at Qandahar out of the jagirs of
K&#863;hurram, which were in the Sarkar of H&#803;i&#7779;&#257;r, and
in the D&#363;-&#257;b and those regions. In the place of these he
might take possession of districts from the Subah of Malwa and the
Deccan, and Gujarat and Khandesh, wherever he wished. Presenting
Afz&#803;al K. with a dress of honour I gave him leave to go. An order
was passed that the Subahs of Gujarat, Malwa, the Deccan and Khandesh
should be handed over to him (K&#863;hurram), and he might take up a
permanent residence wherever he might wish, and employ himself in the
administration of those regions. He was to send quickly the
saz&#257;wuls who had been appointed to bring the servants of the State
who had been summoned to my presence on account of the disturbance at
Qandahar. After that he was to look after his own charge, and not
depart from order: otherwise, he would repent. On this day I gave the
best <i>tipch&#257;q</i> horse that was in my private stable to
&#703;Abdu-llah K. On the 26th H&#803;aidar Beg and Wal&#299; Beg,
envoys of the ruler of Persia, had an audience. After performing the
ceremony of salutation they produced a letter from the Shah. My son

1,000 muhrs, 1,000 rupees, and 18 horses. Mah&#257;bat K. was promoted
to the mansab of 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse. I gave an elephant to
M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam. R&#257;ja S&#257;rang Deo was appointed

territories which belonged to our saintly family passed out of
possession, but when this suppliant at the throne of Grace became
sovereign, he, by God&rsquo;s help, and the excellent measures of
friends, recovered the hereditary lands which were in the possession of
enemies. As Qandahar was held by the agents of your lofty family, I
regarded you as myself, and did not make any objection. From feelings
of unity and brotherhood we waited, thinking that you would, after the
manner of your ancestors<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16347src" href=
"#xd24e16347" name="xd24e16347src">24</a> who are in Paradise,
voluntarily take the matter into your consideration. When you neglected
to do this, I repeatedly, by writing and verbal messages, directly and
indirectly, asked for the disposal of the question, thinking that
perhaps that petty country (Qandahar) was not regarded as worthy of
your notice. You said several times that by making over the territory
to our family, the notions of enemies and censurers would be disposed
of, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb241" href="#v2pb241" name=

put to silence. A faction<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16352src" href=
"#xd24e16352" name="xd24e16352src">25</a> formerly delayed the
settlement of this matter. As the truth of the affair was known to
friends and enemies, and as no clear answer, either of refusal or
concession, came from you, it occurred to me that I would go to
Qandahar to see it, and to hunt. In this way the agents of my
distinguished brother, in accordance with the ties of friendship which
exist between us, might welcome us and wait upon us. By this means the
relationship of union would be renewed, and would be made evident to
the world, and the tongues of the envious and the evil-speaking be
shortened. With this view, I set off without apparatus for taking
forts, and when I came to Far&#257;h I sent a rescript to the governor
of Qandahar, mentioning that I intended to see the place and hunt
there. I did this in order that he might treat me as a guest. We also
called the honourable K&#863;hw&#257;ja B&#257;q&#299; Kurkar&#257;q,
and sent a message to the governor and the other officers in the fort
to the effect that there was no difference between Your Majesty and
ourselves, and that we were aware of each other&rsquo;s territories,
and that we were coming to see the country. Therefore they were not to
act in such a way as to give umbrage or to vex anyone. They did not
receive the conciliatory order and message in the proper way, but
showed obstinacy and a rebellious spirit. When I came to the fort I
again called the honourable aforesaid (K. B&#257;q&#299;), and sent him
with the message that I had directed my troops not to invest the fort
till the lapse of ten days. They did not receive the wholesome advice,
and were stubborn in their opposition. As there was nothing more to be
done, the Persian army set about taking the fort, though it was in want
of appliances, and soon levelled the walls and bastions with the
ground. The garrison became straitened, and asked for quarter. We, too,
maintained the ties of love which had existed from of old between the
two exalted dynasties, and the brotherly relation which was formed
between you and me when you were prince (M&#299;rz&#257;), and which
was an object of envy to contemporary sovereigns, <span class=

Q&#363;rb&#257;s&#863;h&#299;, who is one of the sincere
&#7778;&#363;f&#299;s of this family. Of a truth, the foundation of
love and union, both inherited and acquired, on the part of this seeker
after affection, has not grown old or decayed, and is strong so that no

between them. There should be no need of physical contact, and still
less should there be any necessity for visiting one another&rsquo;s
countries for &lsquo;shooting and spectacle&rsquo; (<i>sair u

<div class="lgouter">
<h4><span class="sc">Verse.</span></h4>
<p class="line">Alas, a hundred times for the love passing thought!</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">&ldquo;By the arrival of your loving letter
apologizing for the &lsquo;spectacle and shooting&rsquo; (<i>sair u
s&#863;hik&#257;r</i>) of Qandahar, which came with the honourable
H&#803;aidar Beg and Wal&#299; Beg, I became apprised of the bodily
health of your angelic personality, and the flowers of joy were
scattered over the world. Let it not be hidden from the world-adorning
mind of my exalted and prosperous brother that until the arrival of the
letter and messages brought by Zamb&#299;l Beg no mention had been made
by you in letters or verbal messages of your wish for Qandahar. At the
time when we were engaged in visiting the delightful land of Kashmir,
the Deccan lords, in their shortsightedness, extended their feet beyond
the limits of obedience, and trod the path of rebellion. Accordingly it
became necessary for me to chastise them. I moved my standards to
Lahore, and appointed my worthy<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16388src"
href="#xd24e16388" name="xd24e16388src">26</a> son S&#863;h&#257;h
J&#257;h&#257;n to proceed against them with a victorious army. I
myself was proceeding to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb244" href=
"#v2pb244" name="v2pb244">244</a>]</span>Agra when Zamb&#299;l Beg
arrived, and produced your loving letter. I took it as a good omen, and
went off to Agra to put down the enemies and the rebels. In the
jewelled and pearl-dropping letter there was no mention of a wish for
Qandahar. It was mentioned verbally by Zamb&#299;l Beg. In reply, I
said to him that I made no difficulty with regard to anything that my
brother wished. Please God, after settling the Deccan affair, I would
send him back in a manner suitable to my sovereignty. I also said that
as he had made long marches he should repose for some days in Lahore,
and that I would afterwards send for him. After coming to Agra, I sent
for him and gave him leave to depart. As the favour of God attaches to
this suppliant, I withdrew my mind from victories and proceeded to the
Panjab. My intention was to send him away, but after disposing of some
necessary matters I went to Kashmir on account of the hot weather.
After coming there I sent for Zamb&#299;l Beg in order to give him his
leave. I also wished to show him something of that delightful country.
Meanwhile news came that my prosperous brother had come to take
Qandahar. This idea had never entered my mind, and I was entirely
astonished. What could there be in a petty village that he should set
out to take it, and that he should shut his eyes to so much friendship
and brotherly feeling? Though truthful reporters sent the news, I could
not credit it! When it became certain I immediately gave orders to
&#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K. not to transgress in any way the good
pleasure of that prosperous brother. Up to now the relationship of
brotherhood stands firm, and I do not value the world in comparison
therewith, nor do I consider any gift equal to it. But it would have
been right and brotherly that he should have waited till the arrival of
the ambassador. Perhaps he would be successful in the object<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e16394src" href="#xd24e16394" name=

come. When he (&#703;Abb&#257;s) takes such steps before the return of
the ambassador, to whom will mankind ascribe the merit of keeping
compacts and of preserving the capital of humanity and liberality! May
God preserve you at all times!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">After I had given leave to the ambassadors, I devoted
all my energy to urging on the Qandahar force, and presented my son
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, who had been sent for for certain matters,
with an elephant, a special horse, a jewelled sword and dagger, and a
dress of honour. I sent him on as an advance guard, and directed him to
remain in Multan until the arrival of Prince S&#863;hahriy&#257;r with
the victorious army. B&#257;qir K., who was faujd&#257;r of Multan, was
summoned to Court, and I appointed &#703;Al&#299;-qul&#299; Beg Darman
to assist him (K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n), and raised him to the
mansab of 1,500. In the same manner, having raised M. Rustam to the
mansab of 5,000, I appointed him to the duty of assisting that son with
the (Qandahar) army. Las&#863;hkar K. came from the Deccan, and waited
on me, and was also attached to that army. Allah-d&#257;d K.

from their fiefs, after being presented with horses and dresses of
honour, were sent with K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n.
&#703;Umdatu-s-sal&#7789;ana &#256;&#7779;af K. was sent to Agra to

<p class="par">As the whole of my world-opening mind was taken up with
the preparation of the Qandahar army, and the remedy for that business,
the unpleasant news that reached me of a change in the condition of
K&#863;hurram, and his want of moderation, became a cause for aversion
and dissension. I accordingly sent M&#363;saw&#299; K., who is one of
the sincere servants who knows my temperament, to that wretch
(<i>b&#299;-daulat</i>) to lay before him the threatening messages and
my wishes, and to give admonitions that might sharpen his intelligence,
so that by the guidance of good fortune he might awake from the dream
of carelessness and pride, and that he (M&#363;saw&#299;) having gained
a (true) knowledge of his futile ideas and aims might hasten to my
presence, and carry out whatever appeared to be necessary. On the 1st
of the Divine month of Bahman the feast of my lunar weighing took
place. At this auspicious ceremony Mah&#257;bat K., having come from
Kabul, paid his respects, and was the recipient of special favours. I
appointed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb247" href="#v2pb247" name=
"v2pb247">247</a>]</span>Ya&#703;q&#363;b K. Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;
to Kabul, exalting him with the gift of drums. About this time report
came from I&#703;tib&#257;r K. from Agra that K&#863;hurram, with the
army of adversity, had left M&#257;nd&#363; and started in that
direction. He had evidently heard the news that the treasure had been
sent for, and fire had fallen into his mind, and having let fall from
his hand the reins of self-control, had started (with the idea) that on
the road he might lay hold of the treasure. Accordingly I thought it
best to proceed for a tour, and in order to hunt to the bank of the
river of Sult&#804;&#257;n-p&#363;r (the Beas). If that wretch by the
guidance of error should place his foot in the desert of audacity, I
might hasten farther forward and place the punishment of his unbecoming
behaviour in the skirt of his fortune. If matters turned out in any
other way I might take steps accordingly. With this purpose, on the
17th of the same month, at an auspicious hour, I marched. Mah&#257;bat
K. was dignified with a dress of honour. Rs. 1,00,000 were ordered to
be given to M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam and Rs. 2,00,000 to &#703;Abdu-llah
K. by way of advance of pay. I sent M&#299;rz&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, s.
Zain K., with a gracious farman to my fortunate son S&#863;h&#257;h
Parw&#299;z, and renewed my urgency for his attendance. R&#257;ja
S&#257;rang Deo had gone to summon R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo: he
came, and having paid his respects, reported that the R&#257;ja, with a
proper force and an equipped army, would join me at Thanesar. At this
time constant reports<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16433src" href=

having placed the foot of ruin in the valley of ignorance and error,
had started in that direction. They therefore did not consider it
advisable to bring the treasure, and were engaged in strengthening the
towers and gates, and providing things necessary for the defence of the
fort. Similarly a report came from &#256;&#7779;af K. that the wretch

"v2pb248">248</a>]</span>approach. As it was not for the advantage of
the State to bring the treasure, he had entrusted it to God, and was
himself on the way to wait on me. Accordingly, having crossed the river
at Sult&#804;&#257;np&#363;r, by successive marches I proceeded to
punish that one of dark fortune, and gave an order that henceforth they
should call him <i>B&#299;-daulat</i> (wretch). Wherever in this record
of fortune &ldquo;B&#299;-daulat&rdquo; is mentioned it will refer to
him. From the kindnesses and favours bestowed upon him I can say that
up till the present time no king has conferred such on his son. What my
reverend father did for my brothers I have done for his servants,
giving them titles, standards, and drums, as has been recorded in the
preceding pages. It will not be hidden from the readers of this record
of prosperity what affection and interest I have bestowed on him. My
pen&rsquo;s tongue fails in ability to set them forth. What shall I say
of my own sufferings? In pain and weakness, in a warm atmosphere that
is extremely unsuited to my health, I must still ride and be active,
and in this state must proceed against such an undutiful son. Many
servants cherished by me for long years and raised to the dignity of
nobility, whom I ought to employ to-day in war against the Uzbeg or the
Persian, I must punish<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16450src" href=
"#xd24e16450" name="xd24e16450src">32</a> for his vileness and destroy
with my own hand. Thank God that he has given me such capacity to bear
my burdens that I can put up with all this, and go on in the same path,
and reckon them as light. But that which weighs heavily on my heart,
and places my eager temperament in sorrow is this, that at such a time
when my prosperous sons and loyal officers should be vying with each
other in the service against Qandahar and Khurasan, which would be to
the renown of the Sultanate, this inauspicious one has struck with an
axe the foot of his own dominion, and become a stumbling-block in the
path of the enterprise. The momentous affair of Qandahar must now be
postponed, but I trust that Almighty God will remove these griefs from
my heart. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb249" href="#v2pb249" name=

Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K., the Master of the Ceremonies, had allied
themselves with B&#299;-daulat, and opened the gates of correspondence
with him. As it was no time for mildness and winking at matters, I
imprisoned all three, and as, after making inquiry into the
circumstances, no doubt remained as to their falseness to their salt,
and about the evil designs and malevolence of K&#863;hal&#299;l and
Muh&#803;tarim, and as Amirs like M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam swore to the
insincerity and malevolence of K&#863;hal&#299;l, having no remedy I
punished them<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16456src" href="#xd24e16456"
name="xd24e16456src">33</a> capitally. Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K., the
dust of whose sincerity was free of suspicion and pure, I brought out
of confinement and promoted. I sent R&#257;ja R&#363;z-afz&#363;n by
post (<i>d&#257;k-chauk&#299;</i>) to my son S&#863;h&#257;h
Parw&#299;z that he might bring him with all haste to wait on me; so
that B&#299;-daulat might be brought to punishment for his improper
conduct. Jaw&#257;hir K., the eunuch, was appointed to the post of
<i>Ihtim&#257;m-i-darb&#257;r-i-mah&#803;all</i> (superintendent of the
harem).</p>
<p class="par">On the 1st of Isfand&#257;rm&#363;z&#817; the royal army
arrived at N&#363;r-sar&#257;y. On this day a report came from
I&#703;tib&#257;r K., that B&#299;-daulat had arrived in all haste in
the neighbourhood of Agra, in the hope that before the fort was
strengthened, the gates of strife and mischief might be opened, and he
might attain his end. When he arrived at Fath&#803;p&#363;r, he found
the gates closed against him, and, being struck with the disgrace of
ruin, he had halted. The K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n and his
son and many of the royal Amirs attached to the Deccan and Gujarat had
come with him as companions on the road of rebellion and ingratitude.
M&#363;saw&#299; K. saw him at Fath&#803;p&#363;r, and showed him the
royal orders, and it was settled that he should send his servant
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z with him to Court to
put his requests before me. He sent to Agra his servant
Sundar,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16467src" href="#xd24e16467" name=

Las&#863;hkar K., and seized Rs. 9,00,000. In the same manner, wherever
he suspected there was property in the houses of other servants (of the
Court), he stretched out his hand to seize it, and took possession of
all that he found. When nobles like
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, who had been distinguished with
the rank of &#256;t&#257;l&#299;k and arrived at the age of seventy
years, made their faces black with rebellion and ingratitude, how could
one complain of others? It may be said that his very nature was
seditious and ungrateful. His father (Bairam K.) at the end of his life
behaved in the same unbecoming way towards my reverend father. He,
following the example of his father, at his age made himself accursed
and rejected to all eternity.</p>

<p class="par first">On this day M&#363;saw&#299; K. arrived with
&#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z, the envoy of B&#299;-daulat. As his
requests were unreasonable, I did not allow him to speak, but handed
him over to Mah&#257;bat to be kept in prison. On the 5th of the month
I pitched on the bank of the river of L&#363;diy&#257;na (the Sutlej).
I promoted K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am to the mansab of 7,000 with
5,000 horse. R&#257;ja Bh&#257;rat, the Band&#299;la, from the Deccan,
and Day&#257;nat K. from Agra, came and waited on me. I pardoned the
offences of Day&#257;nat K., and gave him the same mansab that he had
previously held. R&#257;j&#257; Bh&#257;rat was raised to the mansab of
1,500 and 1,000 horse, and M&#363;saw&#299; K. to that of 1,000 and 300
horse. On Thursday, the 12th, in the pargana of Th&#257;nesar,
R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo, having waited on me, reviewed his army
and elicited great praise. R&#257;ja S&#257;rang Deo was promoted to
the mansab of 1,500 with 600 horse. In Karn&#257;l &#256;&#7779;af K.,
coming from Agra, lifted up the head of honour in kissing my stirrup.
His coming at this time was the herald of victory. Naw&#257;zis&#863;h
K., s. Sa&#703;&#299;d K., having arrived from Gujarat, paid his
respects. When B&#299;-daulat was at Burhanpur, at his request I had
appointed B&#257;q&#299; K. to J&#363;n&#257;ga&#7771;h. He had been
ordered to come to Court, and now came and shared <span class="corr"
id="xd24e16482" title="Source: n">in</span> my service. As my march
from Lahore took place without <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb251"
href="#v2pb251" name="v2pb251">251</a>]</span>previous notice, and time
did not admit of delay or reflection, I came with the few Amirs who
were in attendance. Until I arrived at Sihrind only a few men had the
good fortune to accompany me, but after passing beyond it, great
numbers of the army came in from all sides and quarters. Before arrival
at Delhi such a force had come together that in any direction in which
one looked the whole plain was occupied by troops.</p>
<p class="par">As it was reported that B&#299;-daulat had left
Fath&#803;p&#363;r and was coming in this direction, and making
continuous marches towards Delhi, I gave the victorious army orders to
put on their <i>chiltas</i> (quilted coats). In this disturbance the
pivot of the management of affairs and the arrangement of the army were
entrusted to Mah&#257;bat K. The command of the vanguard was given to
&#703;Abdu-llah K. Of the selected young men and experienced
<i>sip&#257;h&#299;s</i>, whoever was asked for by him was enrolled in
his corps. I ordered him to march a koss ahead of the other forces. He
was also entrusted with the intelligence department and the control of
the routes. I was ignorant of the fact that he was in league with
B&#299;-daulat, and that the real object of that evil-natured one was
to send news from my army to him. Previously to this he used to bring
long written slips of true and false news, saying that his spies had
sent them from that place. The purport was that they (the spies)
suspected some of my servants of being in league with B&#299;-daulat,
and of sending him news. Had I been led away by his intrigues and
become alarmed at this time when the wind of disturbance was blowing
strongly I would have been obliged to destroy many of my servants.
Although some faithful servants suspected his evil intentions and
untruthfulness, the time was not one for removing the veil openly from
the face of his deeds. I guarded my eye and tongue from doing anything
which might carry terror into his evil mind, and showed him more
attention and favour than before, with the idea that possibly he would
be struck with shame, and might turn away from his evil deeds, and give
up his evil nature and sedition. That rejected one to all eternity, in
whom a tendency to vileness and falsity was natural, did <span class=

the 13th year. See Elliot, VI. 362. Jahangir&rsquo;s words are clear:

the meaning is that the archers who were footmen (see Blochmann, 254,
about <i>D&#257;k&#863;hil&#299;</i> troops) lost their vocation when
guns came into use, and became cavalry soldiers. But the meaning in
text may be that the archers took to practising with bows and arrows on
horseback. It appears from a Dast&#363;ru-l-&#703;amal in the I.O., No.

Qandahar surrendered on 11 S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n, 1031, or June 11,
1622. The Shah&rsquo;s letter announcing the fact and explaining his
procedure was presented by H&#803;aidar Beg on 26 &#256;b&#257;n,
1031&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, early in November, 1622. He brought the
officers of the garrison with him. See

<h2 class="main">The Eighteenth New Year&rsquo;s Feast after the
Auspicious Accession</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On the eve of Tuesday, the 20th of
Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal, <span class="sc">A.H.</span> 1032 (March 10,
1623), the sun that lights the world entered his house of honour in
Aries, and the eighteenth year from the beginning of my reign commenced
auspiciously and happily. On this day I heard that B&#299;-daulat,
having gone to the neighbourhood of Mathura, had encamped the army
tainted with ruin in the pargana of S&#863;h&#257;hp&#363;r, and
reviewed 27,000 cavalry. It is hoped that they will soon be subdued and
miserable. R&#257;ja Jay Singh, grandson<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e16524src" href="#xd24e16524" name="xd24e16524src">1</a> of
R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh, came from his native country, and had the
good fortune to kiss my stirrup. I dignified R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh
Deo, than whom in the Rajput caste there is no greater Amir, with the
title of Maharaja, and promoted his son Jogr&#257;j to the mansab of
2,000 with 1,000 horse. Sayyid Bahwa was presented with an elephant. As
it was reported to me that B&#299;-daulat was coming by the bank of the
Jumna, the march of the victorious army in that direction was also
decided on. The array of the army that resembled the waves of the sea
was divided into the van, the right and left wings, the
<i>altmis&#863;h</i>, the <i>t&#804;arah&#803;</i> (reserve), the
<i>chand&#257;wul</i> (rear), etc., and arranged in a manner suitable
to the circumstances and according to the locality. Close upon this
came the news that B&#299;-daulat, with the wretch
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, had turned his reins from the
right road and gone towards the pargana Kotila, 20 koss towards the
left, along with the brahman Sundar, who was his guide to the desert of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb254" href="#v2pb254" name=
"v2pb254">254</a>]</span>error, with D&#257;r&#257;b, s.
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, and many of the Amirs who had
accompanied him on the road of rebellion and rascality, such as Himmat
K., Sar-buland K., S&#863;harza K. &#703;&#256;bid K., J&#257;do
R&#257;y, &#362;day R&#257;m, &#256;tas&#863;h K., Man&#7779;&#363;r
K., and other mansabdars, who were attached to the Deccan, Gujarat, and
Malwa, the recital of whom would take too long, and all his own
servants, such as R&#257;ja Bh&#299;m, s. R&#257;n&#257;, Rustam K.,
Bairam Beg, the Afghan Dary&#257;, Taq&#299;, and others whom he had
left to confront the royal army. There were five<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e16539src" href="#xd24e16539" name="xd24e16539src">2</a> armies
(corps?). Although nominally the command was in the hands of the wretch
(<i>bar-gas&#863;hta-i-r&#363;zg&#257;r</i>) D&#257;r&#257;b, yet in
reality the leader and centre of the whole affair was Sundar, of evil
deeds. These men of darkened fortune pitched in the neighbourhood of
Bal&#363;chp&#363;r to their ruin. On the 8th I pitched at
Qab&#363;lp&#363;r. On this day the turn to take the rear fell upon
B&#257;qir K. We had left him behind all the rest. A body of the rebels
attacked him on the march, and stretched out the hand of plunder.
B&#257;qir planted firmly the foot of courage, and succeeded in beating
them back. K&#863;hw&#257;j&#257; Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan got news of
this, and turned his reins to support him. Before the arrival of the
Khw&#257;ja the rebels (<i>mard&#363;d&#257;n</i>), not being able to
stand, had taken to flight. On Wednesday, the 9th of the month, having
separated 25,000 horse under the leadership of &#256;&#7779;af K.,
Khw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan, and &#703;Abdu-llah K., I sent them
to attack the rebels who did not look to the end of things. Q&#257;sim
K., Las&#863;hkar K., Ir&#257;dat K., Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K., and
other servants, to the number of 8,000 horse, were appointed to
&#256;&#7779;af K.&rsquo;s force. B&#257;qir K., N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n
Qul&#299;, Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain
K&#257;s&#863;hg&#863;har&#299;, and others, to the number of 8,000
horse, were appointed to support Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan.
Naw&#257;zis&#863;h K., &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K.,
&#703;Az&#299;zu-llah, and many of the B&#257;rha and Amroha Sayyids,
were ordered to accompany &#703;Abdu-llah. In this army 10,000 horse
were enrolled. Sundar had arranged the army of ruin and put forward the
foot of shamelessness. At this time I sent my special quiver
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb255" href="#v2pb255" name=
"v2pb255">255</a>]</span>by Zabar-dast K., Master of Ceremonies, to
&#703;Abdu-llah K., that it might be the means of animating his zeal.
When the encounter of the two sides took place, that black-faced one to
all eternity, in whom the tendency to rebellion and ingratitude was
innate, taking to flight, joined the rebels.
&#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K., the son of the K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n, God knows whether knowingly or not, went off with him.
Naw&#257;zis&#863;h K., Zabar-dast K., and S&#863;h&#299;r-h&#803;amla,
who were in the corps of that shameless one (&#703;Abdu-llah K.),
planted firmly the foot of courage, and were not disturbed at his
going. As the aid of Almighty God is ever near this suppliant, at this
crisis, when a leader of the army such as <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e16561" title="Source: &#703;Adbu-llah">&#703;Abdu-llah</span> K.
threw 10,000 cavalry into confusion and joined the enemy, and there was
nearly a great disaster, a shot from a mysterious hand reached Sundar.
At his fall the pillars of the courage of the rebels shook.
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan also drove before him the army
in front of him and defeated it. &#256;&#7779;af K., when B&#257;qir K.
arrived, showing great activity, finished the affair, and a victory
which might be the <i>t&#804;ug&#863;hr&#257;</i> (sign manual) of the
victories of the age showed its face of purpose from the hidden world.
Zabar-dast K., S&#863;h&#299;r-h&#803;amla, S&#863;h&#299;r-bacha, his
son, and the son of Asad K., the architect, and Muh&#803;ammad
H&#803;usain, brother of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, and a number of
the Sayyids of B&#257;rha who were in the corps of the black-faced
&#703;Abdu-llah, having tasted the sweet-flavoured wine of martyrdom,
obtained everlasting life. &#703;Az&#299;zu-llah, grandson of
H&#803;usain K. (Tukriya), being wounded by a gun-shot, got off safely.
Although at this time the desertion of that rejected hypocrite was a
secret help, yet it is probable that if he had not performed this
detestable action in the crisis of the battle, many of the rebel
leaders would have been killed or captured. It chanced that he was
known to the common people by the title of La&#703;natu-llah
(God&rsquo;s curse), and as he had received this name from the hidden
world I also called him by it. Hereafter, wherever the expression
<i>La&#703;natu-llah</i> is used it refers to him. Briefly, after the
rebels, whose end was evil, took to flight from the field of battle,
and turned their faces towards the valley of ruin and could not
reassemble, La&#703;natu-llah, with all the rebels, did not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb256" href="#v2pb256" name=
"v2pb256">256</a>]</span>turn his rein till he reached B&#299;-daulat,
who was at a distance of 20 koss.</p>
<p class="par">When the news of the victory of the servants of the
State reached this suppliant to God, he prostrated himself in
thankfulness for this gift, which was from the renewed favour of Allah,
and summoned the loyal ones into his presence. On the next day they
brought before me the head of Sundar. It appeared that when the ball
struck him he gave up his soul to the lords of hell, and they took his
body to a neighbouring village to be burnt. When they were about to
light the fire, an army appeared in the distance, and for fear lest
they should be taken prisoners, everyone took to flight. The Muqaddam
(head man) of the village cut off his head, and for his own acquittal
took it to K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, as it occurred in his
jagir. He was brought to me (with the head): the head was quite
recognizable and had as yet undergone no change, but they had cut off
the ears for the sake of the pearls in them. No one knew by whose hand
he had been shot. In consequence of his destruction, B&#299;-daulat did
not gird his loins again. One might say his good fortune and courage
and understanding lay in that dog of a Hindu. When, with a father like
me, who in truth am his ostensible creator, and in my own lifetime have
raised him to the great dignity of Sultanship, and denied him nothing,
he acts in this manner, I appeal to the justice of Allah that He may
never again regard him with favour. Those servants who in this
disturbance had done fitting service were honoured with more and more
favours, each according to his degree. K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan was raised to the mansab of 5,000, original and
increased, Naw&#257;zis&#863;h K. to that of 4,000 and 3,000 horse,
B&#257;qir K. to that of 3,000 and 500 horse, with drums,
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain K&#257;s&#863;hg&#863;har&#299; to that
of 2,000 and 1,000 horse, &#703;Az&#299;zu-llah to that of 2,000 and
1,000 horse, N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299; to that of 2,000 and 700
horse, R&#257;ja R&#257;m D&#257;s to that of 2,000 and 1,000 horse,
Lut&#804;fu-llah to that of 1,000 and 500 horse, Parwaris&#863;h K. to
that of 1,000 and 500 horse. If all the servants were to be written in
detail it would take too long. Briefly I remained at that place one day
and marched on the next. K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, having
marched <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb257" href="#v2pb257" name=
"v2pb257">257</a>]</span>from Allahabad, had the good fortune to kiss
the threshold. On the 12th of the month I encamped at the village of
Jh&#257;nsa (?).</p>
<p class="par">On this day Sar-buland R&#257;y came from the Deccan and
waited on me, and was honoured with a special jewelled dagger, with a
<i>ph&#363;l kat&#257;ra</i>. &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K. and some
of those who had gone with La&#703;natu-llah released themselves from
the hand of B&#299;-daulat, and paid their respects, and represented
that when La&#703;natu-llah charged, they thought it was for a cavalry
encounter. When they found themselves in the midst of the rebels they
saw nothing for it but to submit and pay their respects, but now they
had found an opportunity and had obtained the good fortune of kissing
the threshold. Though they had taken 2,000 muhrs from B&#299;-daulat
for their expenses, as the times were critical I made no inquiry, but
accepted<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16582src" href="#xd24e16582" name=
"xd24e16582src">3</a> their statement.</p>
<p class="par">On the 19th the Feast of the culmination was held, and
many of the servants of the State were raised in mansab, and had
suitable favours conferred on them.</p>
<p class="par">M&#299;r &#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daulah, having come from
Agra, waited on me. He brought a vocabulary<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e16589src" href="#xd24e16589" name="xd24e16589src">4</a> of words
that he had prepared. In truth he had taken much pains, and collected
together all the words from the writings of ancient poets. There is no
book like this in the science.</p>
<p class="par">R&#257;ja Jay Singh was raised to the mansab of 3,000
with 1,400 horse, and a special elephant was presented to my son
S&#863;hahriy&#257;r. The post of <i>&#703;Arz&#803;-mukarrir</i>
(examiner of petitions) was conferred on M&#363;saw&#299; K.
Am&#257;nu-llah, s. Mah&#257;bat K., was given the title of
K&#863;h&#257;n-z&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n, was favoured with a mansab of
4,000 personal and horse, and was honoured with a flag and drums.</p>
<p class="par">On the 1st of the Divine month of Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht
I pitched on the bank of the lake at Fath&#803;p&#363;r.
I&#703;tib&#257;r K. came from Agra and waited on me, and was
graciously received. Muz&#804;affar K., Mukarram K., and his brother
also came from Agra, and had the good fortune to wait on me. As
I&#703;tib&#257;r K. had done <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb258"
href="#v2pb258" name="v2pb258">258</a>]</span>approved service in the
charge of the Agra fort he was dignified with the title of Mumt&#257;z
K., and I gave him the mansab of 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse, and
having bestowed on him a dress of honour, a jewelled sword, a horse,
and a special elephant, I sent him back to his duty. Sayyid Bahwa was
promoted to the mansab of 2,000 and 1,500 horse, Mukarram K. to that of
3,000 and 2,000 horse, and K&#863;hw&#257;ja Q&#257;sim to that of
1,000 with 400 horse. On the 4th Man&#7779;&#363;r K. Farang&#299;,
whose circumstances have been recorded<a class="noteref" id=

href="#xd24e16610" name="xd24e16610src">7</a> K. Dakhan&#299;, by the
guidance of good fortune separated themselves from B&#299;-daulat, and
came into my service. I sent K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K. to my
fortunate son S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z. M&#299;rz&#257;
&#703;&#298;s&#257; Tark&#863;h&#257;n, having come from Multan, had
the good fortune to kiss the threshold. A special sword was given to
Mah&#257;bat K. On the 10th the camp was pitched in the pargana of
Hindaun. Man&#7779;&#363;r K. (the Farang&#299;) was raised to the
mansab of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse, and that of Naubat<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e16614src" href="#xd24e16614" name=
"xd24e16614src">8</a> K. to that of 2,000 and 1,000 horse. On the 11th
was a halt. As on this day a meeting with my fortunate son
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z had been arranged, I ordered that the
powerful princes and the illustrious Amirs and all the devoted servants
should go out to meet him, and bring him to wait on me in a fitting
manner. After midday had passed, at an auspicious chosen hour he kissed
the ground and illuminated the forehead of his sincerity. After the
usual salutations had been performed and the customary ceremonies gone
through I embraced my fortunate son with the greatest pleasure and
affection, and loaded him with more and more favours. At this time news
came that B&#299;-daulat, when he was passing through the township
(<i>h&#803;aw&#257;l&#299;</i>) of the pargana of Amber, which was the
hereditary abode of R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh, had sent a band of
scoundrels and plundered that cultivated spot. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb259" href="#v2pb259" name=
"v2pb259">259</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">On the 12th I pitched outside the village of
S&#257;rwal&#299;. I had previously sent H&#803;abas&#863;h K.
(Abyssinian) to repair the buildings at Ajmir. I promoted my fortunate
son S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z to the high mansab of 40,000 and 30,000
horse. As it was reported that B&#299;-daulat had sent off Jagat Singh,
s. R&#257;ja B&#257;so, to his own country to raise disturbances in the
hills of the Panjab, I promoted &#7778;&#257;diq K., chief Bakhshi, to
the governorship of that province, and ordered him to punish him,
giving him a dress of honour, with a sword and an elephant, and making
up his mansab, original and increased, to 4,000 personal and 3,000
horse. I also honoured him with a standard (<i>t&#363;gh</i>) and
drums.</p>
<p class="par">At this time it was reported to me that the younger
brothers of M&#299;rz&#257; Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, s.
M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, who was known as
Fath&#803;p&#363;r&#299;, had attacked him unawares and killed him.
About this time his brothers came to Court and paid their respects. His
own mother also waited on me, but did not make a claim, as was proper,
for her son&rsquo;s blood, and (so) proceedings<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e16628src" href="#xd24e16628" name="xd24e16628src">9</a> could not
be taken according to law. Although his disposition was so bad that his
murder was not to be regretted, but on the contrary was opportune and
advantageous, yet, as these wretches had shown such audacity with
regard to their elder brother, who was to them in the position of a
father, I ordered them to be put in gaol, and afterwards what was
deemed proper should be done to them. On the 21st R&#257;ja Gaj Singh
and R&#257;y S&#363;raj Singh arrived from their jagirs, and had the
good fortune to kiss my stirrup. Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk, whom I had sent
to Multan to summon my son K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, came and waited
on me, and presented me with a letter about his severe illness and
weakness. He had sent his son A&#7779;&#257;lat K. with 1,000 horse to
wait on me, and expressed great regret at being deprived of the honour
of meeting me. As his apology was evidently sincere, I accepted it. On
the 25th my fortunate son Prince Parw&#299;z, with the victorious army,

N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam also gave him a dress of honour, a horse, and
an elephant, as is the custom. To Mah&#257;bat K. and the other Amirs,

Ab&#363; T&#804;&#257;lib (<i>i.e.</i>, S&#863;haista K.), his son, was
appointed to accompany him, and promoted to the mansab of 2,000 with
1,000 horse. On Saturday, the 9th, corresponding with the 19th Rajab,
<span class="sc">A.H.</span> 1032 (May 9, 1623), the camp was pitched

and 3,000 horse, was granted Rs. 2,00,000 of treasure for the expenses
of the army which accompanied him. Rs. 1,00,000 I also gave as an

<p class="par">On this day news came from Agra that Her Highness
(h&#803;az&#803;rat) Maryamu-z-zam&#257;n&#299;,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e16665src" href="#xd24e16665" name="xd24e16665src">12</a> by the
decree of God, had died. I trust that Almighty God will envelop her in
the ocean of His mercy. Jagat Singh, s. R&#257;n&#257; Karan, having
come from his native place, had the good fortune to pay his respects.
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K. Fath&#803;-jang, governor of Bengal, had sent
thirty-four elephants by way of offering, and they were submitted to
me. B&#257;qir K. was appointed faujd&#257;r of Oudh, and
S&#257;d&#257;t K. to the D&#363;-&#257;b. The M&#299;r Mus&#863;hrif
was made D&#299;w&#257;n-i-buy&#363;t&#257;t.</p>
<p class="par">On the 12th of the Divine month of T&#299;r a report
came from the officials of Gujarat with the good news of victory and
conquest. The particulars of this summary are that I had granted the
Subah of Gujarat, the abode of Sultans of high dignity, to
B&#299;-daulat as a reward for his victory over the R&#257;n&#257;, as
has been fully related in the preceding pages. Sundar, the brahman,
administered and protected the country. When futile ideas entered his
ungrateful mind, he sent for that dog of a Hindu, who was always
shaking the chain of enmity and perversity, along with Himmat K.,
S&#863;harza K., Sar-afr&#257;z K., and many of the royal servants who
were fiefholders in the province. Sundar&rsquo;s brother Kunhar was
appointed in his room. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb262" href=
"#v2pb262" name="v2pb262">262</a>]</span>When Sundar was killed, and
B&#299;-daulat retreated after his defeat to M&#257;nd&#363;, the
province of Gujarat was put in the charge of La&#703;natu-llah as his
fief, and Kunhar was sent for along with &#7778;af&#299; K., the diwan.
At the same time the treasure, the jewelled throne on which five lakhs
had been expended, and the <i>pardala</i> (belt) on which two lakhs had
been spent&mdash;and which things had been prepared as a present for
myself&mdash;were also sent for. &#7778;af&#299; K. was the
brother&rsquo;s son (text says &ldquo;brother&rdquo;) of Ja&#703;far
Beg, who received in my father&rsquo;s service the title of
&#256;&#7779;af K., and was married to a daughter of N&#363;r
Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s brother, who by my favour had received the title of
&#256;&#7779;af K. An elder daughter was the wife of B&#299;-daulat.
Both daughters were by one mother, and B&#299;-daulat expected that on
account of this connection &#7778;af&#299; K. would be on his side. But
an eternal decree had gone forth for &#7778;af&#299; K.&rsquo;s loyalty
and prosperity, and that he should attain to high rank! Accordingly,
Almighty God made him loyal and the performer of good deeds, as will
now be described. In short, the faithless (<i>b&#299;-waf&#257;</i>)
La&#703;natu-llah sent his eunuch named Waf&#257;-d&#257;r to be
governor of that country, and he, with a few ragamuffins
(<i>b&#299;-sar-u-p&#257;</i>) entered Ahmadabad, and took possession
of the city. As &#7778;af&#299; K. had made up his mind to be loyal, he
courageously looked after the servants, and collected a force, and won
the hearts of the people. Some days before Kunhar came out of the city
he (&#7778;af&#299;) encamped on the bank of the Kankariy&#257; lake,
and thence hastened to Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d, giving out
openly that he was going to B&#299;-daulat. Secretly, he opened
communication and made arrangements to be loyal with N&#257;hir K.,
Sayyid Dil&#299;r K., N&#257;n&#363;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e16681src" href="#xd24e16681" name="xd24e16681src">13</a> K.,
Afghan, and other devoted servants of the State, who were waiting in
their own jagirs. He awaited his opportunity. &#7778;&#257;lih&#803;, a
servant of B&#299;-daulat, who was faujd&#257;r of the Sarkar of
Pitl&#257;d, and had a good force with him, heard rumours that
&#7778;af&#299; K. entertained other ideas. Kunhar<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e16685src" href="#xd24e16685" name="xd24e16685src">14</a> had
also discovered this, but as &#7778;af&#299; K. soothed them and was
very cautious and careful in his conduct, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb263" href="#v2pb263" name="v2pb263">263</a>]</span>they could not
move hand or foot. &#7778;&#257;lih&#803;, for fear lest
&#7778;af&#299; K., abandoning dissimulation, should stretch his hand
towards the treasure, exercised foresight, and went farther on with the
treasure, taking nearly Rs. 10,00,000 to B&#299;-daulat at
M&#257;nd&#363;. Kunhar (or the younger brother?) also, having seized
the jewelled <i>pardala</i>, started after him, but could not take the
throne on account of its weight. &#7778;af&#299; K., knowing this was
his opportunity, changed his place from Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d
to the pargana of Karang,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16693src" href=
"#xd24e16693" name="xd24e16693src">15</a> which is to the left of the
usual road, where N&#257;n&#363; K. was, and arranged by letter and
verbal messages with N&#257;hir K. and other loyal servants that each
of them should ride from his jagir with the force that he had, and at
the hour of sunrise, which was the morning of prosperity for people of
good fortune, and the evening of ruin to those who practised villainy,
enter the city by the gate to which each was opposite. He
(&#7778;af&#299;) left his women in the aforesaid pargana, and, in
company with N&#257;n&#363; (B&#257;b&#363;?) K., came at dawn to the
outskirts of the city. He halted for a short time in the
S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16696src" href=
"#xd24e16696" name="xd24e16696src">16</a> garden until it had become
light and friend could be distinguished from enemy. After the
world-illuminating sun of good fortune (had risen), when he found the
gate of prosperity open, though he could see no trace of N&#257;hir K.
and the other loyalists, yet lest possibly the enemy might obtain
information and fasten the gates of the fort he placed his confidence
in God who gives victory, and entered the city by the
S&#257;rangp&#363;r gate. About this time N&#257;hir K. also arrived,
and, entering by the gate, came into the city. The eunuch of
La&#703;natu-llah, having ascertained the unfailing good fortune of
(Jahangir), took refuge in the house of S&#863;haik&#863;h
H&#803;aidar, grandson of Niz&#804;&#257;m Waj&#299;hu-d-d&#299;n. The
royal servants <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb264" href="#v2pb264"
name="v2pb264">264</a>]</span>of approved service, having proclaimed
their victory with loud voices, set to work to strengthen the towers
and gates. They sent men to the houses of Muh&#803;ammad Taq&#299;,
B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s diwan, and of H&#803;asan Beg, his Bakhshi, and
seized them. S&#863;haik&#863;h H&#803;aidar himself came and informed
&#7778;af&#299; K. that the eunuch of La&#703;natu-llah was in his
house, and they tied his hands to his neck, and brought him. Having
imprisoned a number of B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s servants and dependants,
they engaged in keeping order in the city. The jewelled throne, the
cash of Rs. 2,00,000, and the property and effects of B&#299;-daulat
and his men in the city, came into their possession. When this news
reached B&#299;-daulat, he sent off La&#703;natu-llah with Himmat K.,
S&#863;harza K., Sar-afr&#257;z K., Q&#257;bil Beg, Rustam
Bah&#257;dur, &#7778;&#257;lih&#803; Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;, and
other criminals. What with royal servants and his own men, he had some
5,000 or 6,000 horse. &#7778;af&#299; K. and N&#257;hir K., becoming
aware of this, planted firmly the foot of courage, and employed
themselves in encouraging their men and collecting forces. Whatever
cash and valuables they could obtain, even to the throne, which they
broke up, they divided amongst both the old and new troopers as pay.
R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n, Zamindar of &#298;dar (printed wrongly
&ldquo;And&#363;r&rdquo;), and the son of L&#257;l Gop&#299;
(?)<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16702src" href="#xd24e16702" name=
"xd24e16702src">17</a>, and all the Zamindars from every quarter, were
summoned into the city. A good number was thus assembled.
La&#703;natu-llah did not wait for auxiliaries, and in the space of
eight days came from M&#257;nd&#363; to Baroda. The loyal party, by the
guidance of their courage, and in reliance on God, came out of the city
and encamped on the bank of the K&#257;nkariy&#257; Lake. It occurred
to La&#703;natu-llah that if he came on quickly, the rope of order of
the loyal might be broken. When he obtained news of the coming out of
the loyal servants, drawing in the reins of ruin, he delayed in Baroda
till the arrival of help. After the evil-ending criminals collected
together at that chief place of mischief, he put forward the foot of
error and deviation from the right path, and the loyal party, marching
from the K&#257;nkariy&#257; tank, encamped outside the village of
Batoh, near the mausoleum of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb265"
href="#v2pb265" name="v2pb265">265</a>]</span>Qut&#804;b
&#703;&#256;lam. La&#703;natu-llah traversed a road of three days in
two,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16707src" href="#xd24e16707" name=
"xd24e16707src">18</a> and arrived at Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d.
As Sayyid Dil&#299;r K. had seized the women of S&#863;harza K. and
brought them from Baroda to the city, and the women of Sar-afr&#257;z
K. were also in the city, &#7778;af&#299; K. sent a secret message to
both of them that if by the guidance of good fortune they would rub off
the stain of sin (rebellion) from the tablet of their foreheads, and
would enrol themselves among the loyal servants, their position in the
present and future worlds would approach salvation; otherwise he would
subject their wives and children to all kinds of indignities. Hearing
this, La&#703;natu-llah sent for Sar-afr&#257;z K. on some excuse to
his house, and imprisoned him. As S&#863;harza K., Himmat K., and
&#7778;&#257;lih&#803; Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; were in league
together, and had alighted at the same place, he could not get
S&#863;harza K. into his hands. Briefly, on the 21st of
S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n, <span class="sc">A.H.</span> 1032, June 10,
1623, La&#703;natu-llah mounted and arrayed the forces tinged with
calamity. Those who were loyal also arrayed their forces and prepared
for the fight. It occurred to La&#703;natu-llah that if he were to go,
their foot of courage would not stand firm, and, without a battle
taking place, they would be dispersed in a miserable condition. When he
saw the firm attitude of the loyal, he could not screw up his courage
(<i>t&#257;b nay&#257;warda</i>), but turned his rein towards the left,
and gave out that they had hidden gunpowder under the ground of that
plain, and that his men would be destroyed by it&mdash;that it would
therefore be better to go into the plain of Sarkhej and deliver battle
there. These futile ideas were due to the aid of good fortune, for on
the turning back of his rein a rumour of his defeat was spread abroad,
and the horsemen of the plain of victory attacked him in flank, and
that ill-omened one was unable to reach Sarkhej, and halted in the
village of N&#257;ranja. The loyal party arranged their forces in the
village of B&#257;l&#363;d, which is nearly three koss off. At dawn on
the next day they went to battle after the approved manner, their
forces being drawn up in this way. In the vanguard were N&#257;hir K.,
R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n, the Zamindar of &#298;dar, and other valiant
men; on the left wing Sayyid Dil&#299;r K., Sayyid S&#299;d&#363;,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb266" href="#v2pb266" name=
"v2pb266">266</a>]</span>and other loyal servants were stationed; and
on the right wing N&#257;n&#363; K., Sayyid Ya&#703;q&#363;b, Sayyid
G&#863;hul&#257;m Muh&#803;ammad, and the rest of the life-sacrificing
devoted ones, whilst in the centre were &#7778;af&#299; K.,
Kif&#257;yat K. Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;, and some other servants of
approved service. It so happened, fortunately, that in the place where
La&#703;natu-llah had halted, the land was undulating, full of thorn
brakes and narrow lanes. The forces, accordingly, were not in compact
order. He had sent on most of the experienced men with Rustam
Bah&#257;dur, and Himmat K., and &#7778;&#257;lih&#803; Beg were
amongst the foremost in (the ranks of) error. The army doomed to
calamity first of all came in contact with N&#257;hir K. and
S&#863;hams K., and a notable fight took place. By chance Himmat K.
fell in the dust of destruction from a gun-shot wound, and a fight
ensued between &#7778;&#257;lih&#803; Beg, and N&#257;n&#363; K.,
Sayyid Ya&#703;q&#363;b, Sayyid G&#863;hul&#257;m Muh&#803;ammad, and
other servants. In the height of the battle the elephant of Sayyid
G&#863;hul&#257;m Muh&#803;ammad came and threw him
(&#7778;&#257;lih&#803;) from his horse; he fell severely wounded to
the ground, and about a hundred of his men were slain. At this moment
an elephant which was in the van of the rebel army turned round at the
noise of the rockets and the lightning of the guns, and got into a
narrow lane, on both sides of which were thorn brakes, and trod down
many of the rebels. By the turning back of the elephant the ranks of
the enemy were disordered. At this moment Sayyid Dil&#299;r K. came
fighting from the right wing. La&#703;natu-llah did not know of the
killing of Himmat K. and &#7778;&#257;lih&#803;, and, with the idea of
helping them, urged on the steed of ruin. As the brave ones in the van,
having displayed activity, had been mostly wounded, they could not
stand the onset of La&#703;natu-llah, and turned back their rein, and
it nearly happened that there was a great disaster. At this time the
assistance of God displayed itself, and &#7778;af&#299; K. hastened
from the centre to the support of the van. Just then La&#703;natu-llah
heard of the killing of Himmat K. and &#7778;&#257;lih&#803; Beg, and,
on the appearance of the centre and the attack of &#7778;af&#299; K.,
his courage failed him, and he became a vagabond in the desert of
defeat and disaster. Sayyid Dil&#299;r K. pursued him for a koss, and
made many of the defeated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb267" href=
"#v2pb267" name="v2pb267">267</a>]</span>the harvest of the sword of
vengeance. Q&#257;bil Beg, unfaithful to his salt, with a body of
rebels, became captives in the claws of retribution. As
La&#703;natu-llah was not sure about Sar-afr&#257;z K., he on the day
of battle placed him in chains on an elephant and put him in charge of
one of his slaves, with orders that if a defeat occurred he should kill
him. In like manner he placed in chains on one of the elephants
Bah&#257;dur, s. Sult&#804;&#257;n Ah&#803;mad, and gave permission to
kill him. When the fight took place the man in charge of
Sult&#804;&#257;n Ah&#803;mad&rsquo;s son put him to death with a
dagger, but Sar-afr&#257;z K. threw himself down off the elephant. The
man in charge of him in that confusion aimed a blow at him in his
bewilderment, but it was not effectual. &#7778;af&#299; K., finding him
in the fight, sent him into the city. La&#703;natu-llah did not turn
back till he arrived at Baroda. As the women of S&#863;harza K. were
captives of those who were loyal, he was helpless, and came and waited
upon &#7778;af&#299; K. Briefly, La&#703;natu-llah hastened from Baroda
to Broach. The sons of Himmat K. were in the fort there. Although they
did not admit him, yet they sent him 5,000
<i>mah&#803;m&#363;d&#299;s</i> by way of maintenance. For three days
he remained outside the fort of Broach in a wretched state, and on the
fourth went to Surat by sea. For nearly two months he remained there
assembling his scattered men. As Surat was in B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s
jagir, he took nearly 4 lakhs of <i>mah&#803;m&#363;d&#299;s</i> from
his officials there, and took possession of whatever he could by
oppression and injustice. He again collected together those whose
fortune was reversed and whose stars had been burnt, and betook himself
to B&#299;-daulat at Burhanpur.</p>
<p class="par">In fine, when this approved service performed by
&#7778;af&#299; K. and other loyal servants in Gujarat became known,
each one was exalted with favours and kindnesses. &#7778;af&#299; K.

3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, I honoured him with the title of Saif

to Muh&#803;ammad K., governor of &#256;s&#299;r and Burhanpur, became
a Musalman, and when Muh&#803;ammad K. died, H&#803;asan, his son, when
in tender years, succeeded him. R&#257;ja &#703;Al&#299; K., brother of
Muh&#803;ammad K., put the child in confinement, and took possession of
the government. After some time news reached R&#257;ja &#703;Al&#299;
K. that K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n and a body of the servants of
Muh&#803;ammad K. had leagued together to attack him, and had
determined to take H&#803;asan K. out of the fort and raise him to
power. He was beforehand with them, and sent H&#803;ay&#257;t
K&#863;h&#257;n H&#803;abas&#863;h&#299;, with many brave men, to the
house of K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, either to take him <span class=
"corr" id="xd24e16745" title="Source: alike">alive</span> or to kill
him. He, planting his foot firmly on his good fame, took to fighting,
and when things went badly with him committed <i>Johar</i>, and passed
from this borrowed life. At that time N&#257;hir K. was very young.
H&#803;ay&#257;t K&#863;h&#257;n Abyssinian, having asked
&#703;Al&#299; K.&rsquo;s permission, adopted him as his son, and made
him a Musalman. After his death R&#257;ja &#703;Al&#299; K. brought up
N&#257;hir K., and took good care of him. When my revered father
conquered &#256;s&#299;r, N&#257;hir K. joined his service. He (Akbar)
discerned the signs of bravery on his forehead, and raised him to a
suitable mansab, and gave him in jagir the pargana of
Muh&#803;ammadp&#363;r in Malwa. In my service he advanced more and
more. Now that the grace of gratitude has been bestowed upon him, he
has found the advantage of doing what was right. <span class=

<p class="par">Sayyid Dil&#299;r K. is of the Sayyids of B&#257;rha;
formerly his name was Sayyid &#703;Abdu-l-Wahh&#257;b. I raised him
from the mansab of 1,000 and 800 horse to 2,000 and 1,200 horse, and
presented him with a standard. They call twelve <i>b&#257;ra</i> in
Hindi. As in the D&#363;-&#257;b there are twelve villages near each
other which are the native country of these Sayyids, they have become
known as the Sayyids of B&#257;rha. Some people make remarks about
their lineage, but their bravery is a convincing proof of their being
Sayyids, for there has never been a battle in this reign in which they
have not been conspicuous, and in which some have not been killed.
M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Az&#299;z Koka always said the Sayyids of
B&#257;rha were the averters of calamity from this dominion, and such
is in reality the case.</p>
<p class="par">N&#257;n&#363; K. Afghan held the mansab of 800 personal
and horse: it was ordered to be one of 1,500 personal and 1,200 horse.
In the same manner the other loyal servants, according to their
services and sacrifices, were promoted to high mansabs, and obtained
the desire of their hearts in lofty employments. At this time
A&#7779;&#257;lat K., s. K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, was deputed to the
assistance of my son (grandson) D&#257;war-bak&#863;hs&#863;h in
Gujarat, and I sent N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299; into the Subah to
bring S&#863;harza K., Sar-afr&#257;z K., and the other leaders of the
rebel army who had been made captive in the land of retribution,
chained, to the Court.</p>
<p class="par">On this day it was reported to me that Min&#363;-chihr,
s. S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K., had separated himself from
B&#299;-daulat under the guidance of good fortune, and had joined the
service of my fortunate son S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z.
I&#703;tiq&#257;d K., governor of Kashmir, was promoted to the mansab
of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse.</p>
<p class="par">As the huntsmen brought news that in this neighbourhood
a tiger had made its appearance, I felt disposed to hunt it. After
entering the forest three other tigers became visible. Having killed
all four, I returned to the palace. I have such a liking for tiger
shooting that whilst I can get it I do not go after other sport.
Sult&#804;&#257;n Mas&#703;&#363;d, s. Sult&#804;&#257;n
Mah&#803;m&#363;d (of Ghaznin) (may the lights of Allah be his
testimony!), was also much inclined to tiger shooting. With regard to
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb270" href="#v2pb270" name=
"v2pb270">270</a>]</span>killing of tigers strange tales have been
recorded, especially in the history of Baihaq&#299;,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e16765src" href="#xd24e16765" name="xd24e16765src">21</a> who
has kept a diary of what he saw with his own eyes. Among these things
he writes that one day he (Mas&#703;&#363;d) went to hunt tigers in the
borders of Hindustan, and was riding an elephant. A very large tiger
came out from the wood, and made for the elephant. He threw a javelin
(<i>k&#863;his&#863;ht</i>) and struck the tiger&rsquo;s chest. The
tiger, enraged at the pain, came up on the elephant&rsquo;s back, and
the Amir knelt down and struck him such a blow with his sword that he
cut off both the tiger&rsquo;s fore-feet, and the tiger fell backwards
and died. It happened to me once when I was prince that I had gone out
in the Punjab to hunt tigers. A powerful tiger appeared out of the
wood. I fired at him from the elephant and the tiger in great fury rose
and came on the elephant&rsquo;s back, and I had not time to put down
my gun and seize my sword. Inverting the gun, I knelt, and with both
hands struck him with the stock over the head and face so that he fell
on to the ground and died.</p>
<p class="par">One of the strange things that happened was that one day
I was on an elephant, and was hunting wolves in Aligarh<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e16773src" href="#xd24e16773" name=
"xd24e16773src">22</a> in the N&#363;h forest. A wolf appeared, and I
struck it with a bullet on its face (<i>mana</i>) near the lobe of the
ear. The bullet penetrated for about a span. From that bullet it fell
and gave up its life. It has often happened in my presence that
powerful (<i>jaw&#257;n&#257;n</i>) men, good shots with the bow, have
shot twenty or thirty arrows at them, and not killed. As it is not
right to write about oneself, I must restrain the tongue of my pen from
saying more.</p>
<p class="par">On the 29th of the month I presented a string of pearls
to Jagat Singh, s. R&#257;n&#257; Karan. At this time it was reported
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb271" href="#v2pb271" name=
"v2pb271">271</a>]</span>me that Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain,
Zamindar of Pakl&#299;, had died. I gave his mansab and jagir to
S&#863;h&#257;dm&#257;n, his eldest son.</p>
<p class="par">On the 7th of the month of Amurd&#257;d
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain, a servant of my fortunate son
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z, came from the victorious army, and brought
news of the victory of the chiefs of the everlasting State. The report
of my son laid before me the particulars of the fight, and the
exertions of the brave and distinguished men in it. I performed the
dues of thanksgiving for this favour, which was of God&rsquo;s grace
alone. The details of this are as follows: When the royal troops in the
army of the prince of high degree crossed the pass of
Ch&#257;nd&#257;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16803src" href=
"#xd24e16803" name="xd24e16803src">23</a> and entered the province of
Malwa, B&#299;-daulat, with 20,000 horse, 300 fighting elephants, and a
large force of artillery, left M&#257;nd&#363; in order to fight. He
dispatched a body of the Barg&#299;s (Mahrattas) of the Deccan with
J&#257;d&#363; R&#257;y and &#362;day R&#257;m, &#256;las&#863;h K.,
and other rebels to make a raid (<i>qazz&#257;q&#299;</i>) on the royal
camp. Mah&#257;bat K. made proper arrangements. He placed the
illustrious prince in the <i>g&#863;haul</i> (centre), and he himself
proceeded with the whole army, and in marching and in halting observed
the conditions of caution. The Barg&#299;s kept at a great distance,
and did not put forward the foot of bravery. One day it was
Man&#7779;&#363;r K. Farang&#299;&rsquo;s turn to be with the
rear-guard. At the time of pitching the camp Mah&#257;bat K., by way of
caution, was standing with his army drawn up outside the camp, in order
that the men might fence it in at their ease. As Man&#7779;&#363;r K.
had been drinking on the road, he was coming to the stage drunk with
the wine of pride. It happened an army was seen in the distance, and
the wine put the idea into his head that he must charge. Without
telling his brothers or his men, he mounted and charged, and drove off
two or three Barg&#299;s, and came to where J&#257;d&#363; R&#257;y and
&#362;day R&#257;m were standing with two or three thousand cavalry
drawn up. As was their custom, they attacked him from all sides and
surrounded him. He fought as long as there was breath in his body, and
gave up his life on the path of loyalty.</p>
<p class="par">During these days Mah&#257;bat K. was continually
capturing, by messages and letters, the afflicted hearts of a number of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb272" href="#v2pb272" name=
"v2pb272">272</a>]</span>men who out of timidity and confusion had
accompanied B&#299;-daulat. When men read the lines of despair on the
page of his (S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s) condition, letters
also came from that side, asking for agreements (<i>qaul</i>). After
B&#299;-daulat came out of the fort of M&#257;nd&#363;, he in the first
instance sent forward a body of Barg&#299;s, and after them he sent
Rustam K., Taq&#299;, and Barq-and&#257;z K. with a body of musketeers.
Then he sent D&#257;r&#257;b K., Bh&#299;m, Bairam Beg, and his other
active men. As he could not resolve to give battle in person, he was
continually looking backwards. He crossed the war-elephants over the
Narbadda with the artillery waggons, and went himself unattended behind
D&#257;r&#257;b and Bh&#299;m, turning his face of ruin towards the
battle. On the day when the royal camp was pitched at
K&#257;liy&#257;daha, B&#299;-daulat sent his army against the
victorious forces, and stationed himself with
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n and a few men at the distance of
a koss in the rear. Barq-and&#257;z K., who had made an agreement with
Mah&#257;bat K., was lying in wait. When the armies were ranged
opposite to each other, he got his opportunity, and attacked with a
body of musketeers, and joined the royal army, crying out,
&ldquo;Success to King Jah&#257;ng&#299;r!&rdquo; When he reached
Mah&#257;bat K., the latter took him to wait on my fortunate son
Parw&#299;z, who bestowed royal favours upon him. Previously he bore
the name of Bah&#257;&#702;u-d-d&#299;n, and was a servant of Zain K.
After the latter&rsquo;s death he enlisted among the Turkish gunners.
As he was active in the performance of his duty, and had a band of men
with him, considering him worthy of patronage, I gave him the title of
Barq-and&#257;z K. When I sent B&#299;-daulat to the Deccan, I put him
at the head of the artillery, and sent him with him. Although in the
beginning he placed the scar of curse on the forehead of his obedience,
yet in the end he turned out well and came at a good time. On the same
day Rustam, who was one of his (S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s)
chief servants and on whom he had perfect reliance, when he found that
Fortune had turned away from him, made a compact with Mah&#257;bat K.
By the guidance of good fortune and reliance on God, he, with
Muh&#803;ammad Mur&#257;d Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; and other
mansabdars, left the ill-fated army, and joined that of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb273" href="#v2pb273" name=
"v2pb273">273</a>]</span>illustrious prince. B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s
hand and heart were paralyzed on hearing this news, and he suspected
all his own servants, and still more the royal servants he had with
him, of faithlessness and unreliability. During the night he sent for
the men who were in front, and decided on flight, and in bewilderment
crossed the Narbadda. At this time, again, some of his servants took
the opportunity of separating themselves from him, and joined the
service of my fortunate son. Each of them received favours according to
his condition. On the day that he crossed the river Narbadda, a letter
fell into the hand of one of his men, that Mah&#257;bat K. had written
in answer to Z&#257;hid&rsquo;s K. letter, making him hopeful of the
royal favour, and urging him to come in. This they sent direct to
B&#299;-daulat, and he, becoming suspicious of Z&#257;hid K.,
imprisoned him with his three sons. Z&#257;hid K. is s.
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K., who was one of the Amirs and trusted
servants of my revered father. I had patronized this wretch in
consideration of his claims of service and of his position as a
house-born one (<i>kh&#257;na-z&#257;d</i>), and given him the title of
Khan and the rank of 1,500, and had sent him with B&#299;-daulat for
the conquest of the Deccan. When I summoned the Amirs of that quarter
on account of the business of Qandahar, although a special farman of
urgency was sent to him, the wretch did not come to Court, and gave
himself out as an adherent and devoted servant of B&#299;-daulat. After
the defeat near Delhi, he turned back. Though<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e16824src" href="#xd24e16824" name="xd24e16824src">24</a> he had
not a family, he had not the good fortune to pay his respects, or to
cleanse the dust of shame and the stain of sin from the tablet of his
forehead. At last the True Recompenser caught him on this day, and his
property, to the extent of one lac and Rs. 30,000, was confiscated by
B&#299;-daulat.</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="par">Briefly, B&#299;-daulat having quickly crossed the
Narbadda, drew all the boats over to that side, and having secured the
fords with men that he trusted, he left Bairam Beg, his Bakhshi, with a
force of trustworthy men and a body of the Barg&#299;s from the Deccan
on the bank of the river. Taking the artillery-waggons, he himself went
towards the fort of &#256;s&#299;r and to Burhanpur. Meanwhile
Taq&#299;, his servant, caught the runner whom
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n had sent to Mah&#257;bat K., and
took him to B&#299;-daulat. This couplet was written on the margin of
the letter:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Hundreds are watching me</p>
<p class="line">Otherwise I&rsquo;d fly away from trouble.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">B&#299;-daulat sent for him with his sons from his
quarters, and showed him the writing. Although he made excuses, he
could give no answer that could be listened to. In short, he kept him
with D&#257;r&#257;b and his other sons in surveillance near his own
station, and the lot he had himself drawn&mdash;viz., that hundreds
were watching him&mdash;happened to him. At this time I gave
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain, the servant of my prosperous son who
had brought the report of the victory, the title of
K&#863;h&#363;s&#863;h-k&#863;habar K., with a dress of honour, and an
elephant, and sent a gracious farman to the Prince and Mah&#257;bat K.
by K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K. I also sent with him a
<i>pah&#363;nch&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e16848src" href=
"#xd24e16848" name="xd24e16848src">26</a> (bracelet) of great value to
my son (Parw&#299;z) and a jewelled sword to Mah&#257;bat K. As
Mah&#257;bat K. had done approved service, I gave him the mansab of
7,000 personal and horse.</p>
<p class="par">Sayyid &#7778;alabat K., having come from the Deccan,
had the good fortune to pay his respects, and received special favours.
He was one of those employed in the Deccan. When B&#299;-daulat, having
been defeated near Delhi, went to the fort of M&#257;nd&#363;, he
placed his children in independent territory under the protection of
God, and went off by secret routes to pay his respects (to me).
M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;asan, s. M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam
&#7778;afaw&#299;, having obtained leave to proceed to his appointment
as faujd&#257;r of Bahraich, was given the mansab of 1,500 personal and
500 horse, original and increased. Having sent La&#703;l Beg,
Superintendent of the Record Department, to my fortunate son
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb275" href="#v2pb275" name=
"v2pb275">275</a>]</span>S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z, I sent with him a
special dress of honour and a <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> for him, and a
turban for Mah&#257;bat K. K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K., who had
previously been sent to him and had returned, waited upon me with good
news (of him). K&#863;h&#257;na-z&#257;d K., s. Mah&#257;bat K., was
given the mansab of 5,000 personal and horse.</p>
<p class="par">At this time I enjoyed myself for a day with hunting
n&#299;lg&#257;w. Whilst I was hunting I saw a snake the length of
which was 2&frac12; yards, and its girth equal to three cubits
(<i>dast</i>). He had swallowed half a hare, and was in the act of
swallowing the other half. When the huntsmen picked him up and brought
him to me, the hare fell out of his mouth. I ordered them to put it
into its mouth again, but they could not do it, however much they
exerted themselves; but by using great violence the corner of his mouth
was torn to pieces. After this I ordered them to open its belly.
Thereupon another entire hare came out. They call this kind of snake
<i>ch&#299;tal</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e16865src" href=
"#xd24e16865" name="xd24e16865src">27</a> in Hindustan, and it grows so
large that it swallows a hog-deer (<i>kot&#257;h-p&#257;cha</i>)
entire; but it is not poisonous, and does not bite. One day during the
same hunt I shot a female n&#299;lg&#257;w, and two fully formed young
ones were found inside. As I heard that the flesh of n&#299;lg&#257;w
fawns was delicate and delicious, I ordered the royal cooks to prepare
a <i>d&#363;-piy&#257;za</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e16873src" href=
"#xd24e16873" name="xd24e16873src">28</a> (a kind of rich fricassee).
Certainly it was not without flavour.</p>
<p class="par">On the 15th of the Divine month of S&#863;hahr&#299;war
Rustam K., Muh&#803;ammad Mur&#257;d, and several other servants of
B&#299;-daulat, who under the guidance of good luck had separated
themselves from him and entered the service of my fortunate son
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z, according to orders came to Court, and had
the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Having promoted Rustam K. to
the mansab of 5,000 personal and 4,000 horse, and Muh&#803;ammad
Mur&#257;d to that of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, I made them hopeful
of daily increasing favours. Rustam K. by extraction is a
Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;. His name was Y&#363;suf Beg. He is
connected with Muh&#803;ammad-qul&#299; of Isfahan, who was agent for
and prime minister of M&#299;rz&#257; Sulaim&#257;n (of Badakhshan). He
was first of all in the service of the Court, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb276" href="#v2pb276" name=
"v2pb276">276</a>]</span>and passed his days mostly in the Subahs. He
was included among the smaller mansabdars. Having been deprived of his
jagir for some reason, he came to B&#299;-daulat, and entered his
service. He had a perfect knowledge of tiger-hunting. He also did good
service with him, especially in the affair of the R&#257;n&#257;.
B&#299;-daulat selected him out of all his servants, and made him an
Amir. As I bestowed much favour on him (S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n), at
his request I gave him the title of Khan, with a standard and drums.
For some time he conducted as his agent the government of Gujarat, and
did not manage badly. Muh&#803;ammad Mur&#257;d is the son of
Maq&#7779;&#363;d M&#299;r-&#257;b (butler), who was one of the old
servants of M&#299;rz&#257; Sulaim&#257;n and M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;h-ruk&#863;h.</p>
<p class="par">On this day Sayyid Bahwa came from Gujarat, and waited
on me. N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299; brought in chains to the Court
forty-one of the rebels, who had been taken prisoners at Ahmadabad.
S&#863;harza K. and Q&#257;bil Beg, who were ring-leaders of the
seditious, I executed by throwing them under the feet of warlike
(<i>mast</i>) elephants. On the 20th of the same month, corresponding
with the 18th of the month of Z&#817;&#299;-qa&#703;da, a daughter was
given by the grace of God to my son S&#863;hahriy&#257;r by the
granddaughter<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16885src" href="#xd24e16885"

name="xd24e16888src">30</a> will be propitious and blessed to this
State. On the 22nd of the month the feast of my solar weighment took
place, and the 55th year of the age of this suppliant began
auspiciously and happily. According to annual custom, I had myself
weighed against gold and other valuables, and gave them to deserving
people. Among these I gave Rs. 2,000 to S&#863;haik&#863;h
Ah&#803;mad<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16891src" href="#xd24e16891"

of Mihr M&#299;r Jumla was promoted to the mansab of 3,000 personal and
300 horse. Muq&#299;m, the Bakhshi of Gujarat, was given the title of
Kif&#257;yat K. As the innocence of Sar-far&#257;z K.<a class="noteref"

respects. At the request of my son S&#863;hahriy&#257;r, I went to his
house. He had prepared a grand entertainment, and presented suitable
offerings, and gave dresses of honour to most of the servants.</p>
<p class="par">At this time a report came from my fortunate son
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z that B&#299;-daulat had crossed the river
of Burhanpur (the Tapt&#299;), and was wandering in the desert of
error. The particulars are that when he crossed the Narbadda and drew
all the boats to that side, and fortified the banks of the river and
the ferries with cannon and muskets, he left Bairam Beg on the bank
with a large number of the rebels, and withdrew towards &#256;s&#299;r
and Burhanpur. The K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n and
D&#257;rab he took with him under surveillance.</p>
<p class="par">And now, for the sake of enlivening my narrative, a few
words must be said about &#256;s&#299;r. The said fort, in its great
height and strength, is not in want of my praise. Before B&#299;-daulat
went to the Deccan it was in the charge of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Na&#7779;ru-llah, s. K&#863;hw&#257;ja Fath&#803;u-llah, who was one of
the household slaves and ancient servants. Afterwards, at the request
of B&#299;-daulat, it was handed over to M&#299;r
H&#803;us&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n, s. M&#299;r Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n
H&#803;usain.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16904src" href="#xd24e16904"
name="xd24e16904src">33</a> As the daughter of N&#363;r Jah&#257;n
Begam&rsquo;s maternal uncle (<i>tagh&#257;&#702;&#299;</i>) was
married<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16910src" href="#xd24e16910" name=
"xd24e16910src">34</a> to him, when B&#299;-daulat, having been
defeated in the neighbourhood of Delhi, turned his rein towards Malwa
and M&#257;nd&#363;, N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam wrote to him and
strictly urged him, saying: &ldquo;Beware, a thousand times beware, not
to allow B&#299;-daulat and his men to come near the fort, but
strengthen the towers and gates, and do your duty, and do not act in
such a manner that the stain of a curse and ingratitude for favours
should fall on the honour or the forehead of a Sayyid.&rdquo; In truth,
he strengthened it well, and the arrangements of the fort were not of
such a sort that B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s bird of thought could fly up to
its border, or the conquest of it be quickly accomplished. In brief,
when B&#299;-daulat sent one of his attendants, of the name
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb278" href="#v2pb278" name=
"v2pb278">278</a>]</span>of S&#863;har&#299;f&#257;, to the
above-mentioned, he (S&#863;har&#299;f&#257;) seduced him by means of
promises and threats, and it was settled (between S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n and S&#863;har&#299;f&#257;) that when
H&#803;us&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n should come down to take the letter and
dress of honour which had been sent, he should not be allowed to go up
again. That wretch, immediately S&#863;har&#299;f&#257; arrived, put
away on the shelf of forgetfulness what he owed on account of his
bringing up and the favours conferred on him, and without opposition or
effort handed over the fort to S&#863;har&#299;f&#257;, and with his
wife<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16917src" href="#xd24e16917" name=
"xd24e16917src">35</a> and child went to B&#299;-daulat, who made him
accursed of the Faith and in the world by bestowing on him the mansab
of 4,000 personal, and a standard and drums, and the title of
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K.&mdash;a disgraceful name to all eternity.</p>
<p class="par">In short, when that one of reversed fortune reached the
foot of the fort of &#256;s&#299;r, he took with him
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, D&#257;r&#257;b, and all his
evil-minded offspring up to the fort, and remaining there for three or
four days, and having set his mind at ease about provisions, etc.,
handed it over to one Gop&#257;l D&#257;s, a Rajput, who had formerly
been an attendant of Sar-buland R&#257;y, and entered his service when
he went to the Deccan. He left the women and his superfluous baggage,
and took with him his three wives with their children and some
maid-servants. At first he proposed to imprison
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n and D&#257;r&#257;b in the fort,
but at last changed his mind, and bringing them down with him, hastened
to Burhanpur. At this time La&#703;natu-llah, after suffering disgrace
and contempt, came from Surat and joined him. In great perplexity,
B&#299;-daulat employed Sar-buland R&#257;y, the son of R&#257;y Bhoj
H&#257;r&#257;, who is one of the brave Rajput servants, and who is fed
from the royal table (?), as his mediator, and by letters and messages
made proposals of peace. Mah&#257;bat K. said that until
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n came, peace was impossible. His
(Mah&#257;bat&rsquo;s) sole purpose was by these means to separate from
him that head of deceivers who was the ring-leader of trouble and
sedition. Being helpless, B&#299;-daulat brought him
(K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n) out of prison, and satisfied
himself by taking an oath from him on the Qoran. In order to please him
and strengthen his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb279" href=
"#v2pb279" name="v2pb279">279</a>]</span>promises and oath, he took him
inside the female apartment and made a confidant<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e16925src" href="#xd24e16925" name="xd24e16925src">36</a> of him,
and brought his own wife and son to him, and made use of all kinds of
entreaty and lamentation. The gist of his (S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s) remarks was: &ldquo;My times are hard, and my
position difficult; I make myself over to you, and make you the
guardian of my honour. You must act so that I no longer undergo
contempt and confusion.&rdquo; The
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, with a view to bring about
peace, parted from B&#299;-daulat and proceeded to the royal army. It
was settled that he should remain on the other side of the river, and
arrange matters relating to peace in writing. According to fate, before
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n arrived on the bank of the
river, some of the brave warriors and victorious youths one night found
an opportunity and crossed over at a place where the rebels were
careless. On hearing this news the pillars of their courage trembled,
and Bairam Beg could not keep firm the foot of error and ignorance, or
engage in driving them back. Whilst he was in this agitation<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e16930src" href="#xd24e16930" name=
"xd24e16930src">37</a> many crossed the river, and on the same night
the rebels of evil fortune were separated from each other like the
<i>Ban&#257;tu-n-na&#703;&#257;s&#863;h</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e16942src" href="#xd24e16942" name="xd24e16942src">38</a> and took
to flight. By the unfailing good fortune (of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r) the
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n fell into perplexity (lit. fell
into the <i>s&#863;has&#863;h-dar</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e16951src" href="#xd24e16951" name="xd24e16951src">39</a>
position), and could neither go nor stay where he was. At this time
again letters arrived from my prosperous son mingling threats with
promises. The K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, finding only
despair and ruin in the page of B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s affairs,
hastened, through the mediation of Mah&#257;bat K., to wait upon my
fortunate son. B&#299;-daulat, on hearing of the departure of
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n and the crossing of the Narbadda
by the victorious army and the flight of Bairam Beg, lost courage, and,
notwithstanding a flood in the river and the violence of the rain,
crossed the Tapt&#299; in a state of wretchedness, and went off towards
the Deccan. In this confusion many of the royal servants and his own
attendants willingly or unwillingly separated, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb280" href="#v2pb280" name=
"v2pb280">280</a>]</span>did not accompany him. As the native country
of J&#257;do R&#257;y and &#362;day R&#257;m and &#256;tas&#863;h K.
was on the route, they thought it better for themselves to keep with
him for some stages, but J&#257;do R&#257;y did not come into his camp,
and followed him at the distance of one stage. He took possession of
such property as the men in this confusion and fear for their lives
abandoned. On the day he (S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n) started from the
other side of the river (the Tapt&#299;) he sent a message by one of
his immediate attendants of the name of Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r K.
Turkm&#257;n, summoning Sar-buland K. Afghan, with the message that it
seemed to him contrary to courage and the due performance of his
engagements that he had as yet not crossed the river. &ldquo;Fidelity
was the glory of men; the faithlessness of no one has touched me
(S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n) so much as yours.&rdquo; He (Sar-buland)
was standing on horseback on the river-bank when
Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16961src" href=
"#xd24e16961" name="xd24e16961src">40</a> K. came and delivered the
message. Sar-buland did not give a precise answer, and was undecided as
to whether to stay or go. In his perplexity and by way of objection he
told Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r to let go his bridle.
Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r drew his sword, and struck at his waist. At
this crisis an Afghan interposed a short spear which the people of
India call a <i>barchh&#257;</i>, and the blow of the sword caught the
shaft, and the point of the sword did not reach Sar-buland&rsquo;s
waist. After swords were drawn, the Afghans attacked
Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r and cut him in pieces. The son of
Sult&#804;&#257;n Muh&#803;ammad, the treasurer, who was
B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s page, for friendship&rsquo;s sake had come (with
Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r) without B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s permission,
and was also killed.</p>
<p class="par">Briefly, when the news of his leaving Burhanpur and of
the victorious army&rsquo;s approaching that city reached me, I sent
K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K. on the wings of haste to my loyal
son, and strongly impressed upon him that he must not relax his
efforts, but must determine either to take him alive or to drive him
out of the imperial territory. It was said that if things went badly
with him on this side, it was probable that he would throw himself by
the road of Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk&rsquo;s country into the provinces of
Orissa and Bengal. This, too, was in accordance <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb281" href="#v2pb281" name=
"v2pb281">281</a>]</span>with military plans. So out of caution, which
is becoming to a ruler, I appointed M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam to be
governor of Allahabad and dismissed him with orders that if such
circumstances should so occur (as S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s
going to Bengal), he should rectify matters.</p>
<p class="par">At this time my son (<i>farzand</i>) K&#863;h&#257;n
Jah&#257;n came from Multan, and had the good fortune to pay his
respects. By way of nazar he presented 1,000 muhrs and a ruby of the
value of Rs. 100,000, a pearl, and other jewels. I gave an elephant to
Rustam K. On the 9th of the Divine month of &#256;b&#257;n
K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K. brought a report from the prince and
Mah&#257;bat K. to the effect that when my son (Parw&#299;z) reached
Burhanpur, though many of his men had remained behind in consequence of
the heavy rains, he, according to orders, without delay had crossed the
river (Tapt&#299;), and gone in pursuit of B&#299;-daulat.
B&#299;-daulat, on hearing this terrible news, was marching on. On
account of the heaviness of the rain and the excessive quantity of mud
and constant marching his beasts of burden had become exhausted. If any
baggage was left behind no inquiries were made, and he (S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n) and his children and dependents thought themselves lucky to
save their lives and did not trouble about their goods. The army of
good fortune having come down the pass of Bhangar, hastened after him
as far as the pargana of Ankot,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16976src"
href="#xd24e16976" name="xd24e16976src">41</a> about forty koss from
Burhanpur. B&#299;-daulat in this state reached the fort of
M&#257;h&#363;r, and when he knew that J&#257;do R&#257;y and &#362;day
R&#257;m and the other Dakhanis would not go with him any farther, he
did not disgrace them, but let them go. Leaving the heavy elephants
with the goods and chattels with &#362;day R&#257;m in the fort, he
himself started for Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk&rsquo;s territory. When his
departure from the royal territory was ascertained, my fortunate son,
with the approval of Mah&#257;bat K. and other loyalists, turned rein
from that pargana. On the first of the Divine month of &#256;b&#257;n
he entered Burhanpur. R&#257;ja S&#257;rang Deo was sent to my son with
a gracious farman.</p>
<p class="par">Q&#257;sim K. was raised to the mansab of 4,000 personal
and 2,000 horse. M&#299;rak Mu&#703;&#299;n, Bakhshi of Kabul, at the
request <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb282" href="#v2pb282" name=
"v2pb282">282</a>]</span>of Mah&#257;bat K., was honoured with the
title of Khan. Alf K. Qiy&#257;m-k&#863;h&#257;n&#299;, having come
from the Subah of Patna, paid his respects, and was appointed to the
charge of the fort of K&#257;ngra. I presented him with a standard. On
the 1st of the Divine month of &#256;z&#817;ar B&#257;q&#299; K. came
from J&#363;n&#257;garh and waited on me.</p>
<p class="par">As I was at ease with regard to the affair of
B&#299;-daulat, and the heat of Hindustan did not agree with my
constitution, on the 2nd of the month, corresponding with the 1st of
&#7778;afar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e16985src" href="#xd24e16985"
name="xd24e16985src">42</a> my camp started from Ajmir for a tour and
to hunt in the pleasant regions of Kashmir. Before this I had appointed
the chief of the state &#256;&#7779;af K. Subahdar of Bengal, and gave
him leave. As I had taken a great liking to his society, and he was
distinguished above all the other servants for ability and good
disposition and tact, and is moreover unequalled in all kinds of
propriety, and I regretted separation from him, I had broken through
that purpose, and had sent for him to wait upon me. He came on this
day, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Jagat Singh, s.
R&#257;n&#257; Karan, took leave on his return to his native country,
and was given a dress of honour and a jewelled dagger. R&#257;ja
S&#257;rang Deo brought a report from my fortunate son S&#863;h&#257;h
Parw&#299;z and Mah&#257;bat K. Mad&#257;ru-s-salt&#804;ana, and kissed
the threshold. It was written that their minds were at ease with regard
to the affair of B&#299;-daulat, and that the rulers of the Deccan,
willingly or unwillingly, were performing the dues of obedience and
submission. His Majesty (Jah&#257;ng&#299;r) might make his mind at
ease about that quarter and enjoy himself in hunting and travelling in
whatever place in the royal dominions he might approve of and which was
good for his health. On the 20th of the month M&#299;rz&#257;
W&#257;l&#299;, having come from Sironj, waited on me. H&#803;ak&#299;m
M&#363;min&#257; was raised to the mansab of 1,000. A&#7779;&#257;lat
K., s. K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, according to order, came from
Gujarat, and had the good fortune to pay his respects.</p>
<p class="par">At this time a report came from &#703;Aq&#299;dat K.,
Bakhshi of the Deccan, containing the news of R&#257;ja Girdhar&rsquo;s
having been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb283" href="#v2pb283"
name="v2pb283">283</a>]</span>killed. The particulars of this event are
that one of the brothers of Sayyid Kab&#299;r B&#257;rha, who was an
attendant of my fortunate son S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z, gave his
sword to brighten and put on the wheel (to sharpen) to a cutler who had
a shop close to the house of R&#257;ja Girdhar. The next day, when he
came to fetch his sword, a conversation took place as to the charge for
the work, and the people of the Sayyid struck the cutler some blows
with a stick. The Raja&rsquo;s people in supporting him used their
whips on them. By chance two or three young Sayyids of B&#257;rha had
lodgings in that neighbourhood, and hearing of this disturbance, went
to the assistance of the aforesaid Sayyid. The fire of strife was
lighted, and a fight took place between the Sayyids and Rajputs, ending
in an encounter with arrows and swords. Sayyid Kab&#299;r, becoming
aware of this, came to assist with thirty or forty horsemen, and at
this time R&#257;ja Girdhar, with a body of Rajputs and his caste
people, according to the custom of the Hindus, were sitting barebodied
and eating their food. Becoming aware of the coming of Sayyid
Kab&#299;r and the violence of the Sayyids, he brought his men inside
the house and firmly closed the door. The Sayyids, setting fire to the
door, forced their way inside and the fight went to such a length that
R&#257;ja Girdhar and twenty-six of his servants were killed and forty
others wounded. Four of the Sayyids were also killed. After R&#257;ja
Girdhar was killed, Sayyid Kab&#299;r took the horses out of his stable
to his own house and returned. The Rajput officers, when informed of
the slaying of R&#257;ja Girdhar, came on horseback in great numbers
from their houses, and all the B&#257;rha Sayyids came to the aid of
Sayyid Kab&#299;r. They assembled in the plain outside the citadel, and
the fire of trouble and calamity increased, and it nearly came to a
great disturbance. Mah&#257;bat K., being informed of it, immediately
mounted and went there, and bringing the Sayyids into the citadel, and
soothing the Rajputs in a manner suitable to the occasion, took some of
their chief men with him and went to the house of K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam, which was near there. He soothed them down in a proper
way, and promised and became security for an inquiry into the matter.
When this news reached the prince <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb284" href="#v2pb284" name="v2pb284">284</a>]</span>he also went to
the quarters of the K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, and soothed them
with words appropriate to the state of affairs, and sent the Rajputs to
their own houses. Next day Mah&#257;bat K. went to the house of
R&#257;ja Girdhar, condoled and sympathized with his sons, and having
contrived to get hold of Sayyid Kab&#299;r put him into confinement. As
the Rajputs would not be consoled without his being put to death, after
a few days he executed him.</p>
<p class="par">On the 23rd I appointed Muh&#803;ammad Mur&#257;d
faujd&#257;r of Ajmir, and sent him off. On this road I continually
enjoyed myself in sporting. One day, while hunting, a
<i>t&#363;yg&#863;h&#363;n</i> (albino) partridge, which till now I had
never seen, came to my sight, and I caught it with a hawk. By chance
the hawk that caught it was also a <i>t&#363;yg&#863;h&#363;n</i>. I
ascertained by trial that the flesh of the black partridge was better
than that of the white, and that the flesh of the large quail
(<i>b&#363;dana</i>), which the people of India call
<i>gh&#257;ghar</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e17008src" href=
"#xd24e17008" name="xd24e17008src">43</a> is better than that of the
quail, which is a fighter. I compared the flesh of a fat kid with that
of a lamb; the flesh of the fat kid is more delicious. By way of test I
ordered them both to be cooked in the same way, so that I might discern
the matter accurately. On this account I have recorded it.</p>
<p class="par">On the 10th of the month of Dai, in the neighbourhood of
the pargana of Rah&#803;&#299;m&#257;b&#257;d,<a class="noteref" id=

Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K. to take with them some of the guards
(<i>ahl-i-y&#257;tis&#863;h</i>) and surround the wood, and mounting
(an elephant) I followed them and went towards the hunt. From the
number of trees and thickness of the jungle it could not be well seen.
Driving the elephant forward, the tiger&rsquo;s flank came into view,
and with one wound from my gun he fell and gave up his life. Of all the
tigers I have shot from the time when I was a prince until now I never
saw a tiger like this for size and majesty and the symmetry of its
limbs. I ordered the artists to take its portrait according to its real
form and body. He weighed 8&frac12; Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; maunds;

was in the service of Bah&#257;dur K., the brother of K&#863;h&#257;n
Zam&#257;n. After they were killed he entered the service of my revered
father. When I placed my foot in the world of existence that revered
person favoured me with making him the N&#257;z&#804;ir
(Superintendent) of my establishment. For a period of fifty-six years
he served me sincerely and zealously and in a manner to please me, and
at no time did a speck of dust from him settle on the fringe of my

than a clerk could write. May God Almighty overwhelm him in the ocean

<p class="par">Having conferred on Muqarrab K., who is one of the old

I gave him his leave. In the neighbourhood of Fath&#803;p&#363;r,
Mukarram K. and his brother &#703;Abdu-s-Sal&#257;m had the good
fortune to pay their respects. On the 22nd the entertainment for my
lunar weighment took place in the town of Mathura, and the
fifty-seventh year of my age began auspiciously and happily. At Mathura
I went on by boat seeing what was to be seen, and hunting. On the way
the huntsmen reported that a tigress with three cubs had appeared.
Disembarking from the boat I engaged in the pleasure of sport. As the
cubs were small I ordered them to be taken by hand, and killed the
mother with my gun. At this time it was reported to me that the

stubbornness and fearlessness, would not pay their rents to the
jagirdars. I gave an order to K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n to take a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb286" href="#v2pb286" name=
"v2pb286">286</a>]</span>force of mansabdars with him and give them
exemplary punishment, and having slaughtered, imprisoned, and plundered
them, raze to the ground their strongholds and forts, and tear up from
the root their thorn-brakes of mischief and disturbance. The next day
the force crossed the river and made a hot attack on them. As they had
no time for escape by flight they planted firmly the foot of folly, and
showed fight. Many of them were slaughtered: their women and children
were taken prisoners, and much booty fell into the hands of the
victorious army.</p>
<p class="par">On 1st Bahman, having promoted Rustam K. to the
faujd&#257;rship of the Sarkar of Qanauj, I sent him there.</p>
<p class="par">On the 2nd &#703;Abdu-llah, s. H&#803;ak&#299;m
N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n, of Teheran, was ordered to be capitally punished
in my presence. The explanation of this brief announcement is as
follows: When the ruler of Persia, on suspicion of his having money and
other property, tortured his father, the aforesaid fled from Persia,
and with a hundred miseries and adversities threw himself into
Hindustan, and by the patronage of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula was
enrolled among the servants of the Court. By the aid of good fortune,
having in a short time become well known, he was included among those
who were in immediate attendance, and obtained a mansab of 500 and a
fertile jagir, but as his capacity was small (lit., his digestion was
narrow) he could not stand such great good fortune, and assumed
ingratitude and unthankfulness and constantly defiled his tongue with
abuse<a class="noteref" id="xd24e17067src" href="#xd24e17067" name=
"xd24e17067src">49</a> of his lord and master. At this time it was
continually reported to me that as my kindness to him and observance of
what was due to him increased, that ungrateful one blamed and abused me
the more. When I considered the favours I had bestowed upon him, I
could not believe these stories about him, but at last I heard from
impartial and disinterested persons the disrespectful language which he
had used with respect to me in assemblies and companies. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb287" href="#v2pb287" name=
"v2pb287">287</a>]</span>The charge was thus confirmed, and accordingly
I summoned him to my presence and had him executed.<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e17084src" href="#xd24e17084" name="xd24e17084src">50</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A red<a class="noteref" id="xd24e17091src" href=
"#xd24e17091" name="xd24e17091src">51</a> tongue gives the green head
to the winds.&rdquo; As the huntsmen reported that there was a tigress
in this neighbourhood, by the mischief caused by which the inhabitants
were oppressed, I ordered Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K. to take elephants
with him and surround it. Mounting myself, I followed him into the
forest. It soon came to view, and with one shot from my gun its affairs
were finished. One day I was enjoying myself with sport, and caught a
black partridge with a hawk. I ordered them to open its crop in my
presence. A mouse it had swallowed whole came out of its crop, and
which was not yet digested. I was greatly astonished that the pipe of
its gullet, small as it was, should swallow a whole mouse and how it
had done so. Without exaggeration, if anyone had told me the tale I
should not have believed it. As I saw this myself I have recorded it on
account of its strangeness. On the 6th of the month Delhi became the
abode of good fortune.</p>
<p class="par">As Jagat Singh, s. R&#257;ja B&#257;so, at the
instigation of B&#299;-daulat, had gone out into the hills in the north
of the Panjab, which <span class="corr" id="xd24e17096" title=
"Source: are">is</span> his hereditary abode, and raised a disturbance
there, I appointed &#7778;&#257;diq K. to punish him, as has been
related in the preceding pages. At this time M&#257;dho Singh, his
younger brother, was promoted to the title of Raja, and given a horse
and robe of honour. An order was given for him to go to
&#7778;&#257;diq K. and attack the rebels with him.</p>
<p class="par">Next day I marched from the outskirts of the city, and
alighted at Sal&#299;mgarh. As the house of R&#257;ja Kis&#863;han
D&#257;s was on the road, and he had made great efforts and entreated
me to do so, I at his request threw the shadow of prosperity on his
dwelling, and gratified the desire of that old servant. A few of his
offerings were accepted in order to dignify him. Marching on the 20th
from Sal&#299;mgarh, I appointed Sayyid Bahwa Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#299;
to the governorship of Delhi, which is his ordinary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb288" href="#v2pb288" name=
"v2pb288">288</a>]</span>residence. In fact, he had already done this
service well, and I had given him high rank.</p>
<p class="par">At this time &#703;Al&#299; Muh&#803;ammad, s.
&#703;Al&#299; R&#257;y,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e17105src" href=
"#xd24e17105" name="xd24e17105src">52</a> ruler of Tibet, by his
father&rsquo;s order came to Court, and had the good fortune to pay his
respects. It was clear that &#703;Al&#299; R&#257;y had a great
affection for and attachment to this son, and held him dearer than his
other children. He wished to make him his successor, and he was
consequently envied by his brothers, and disputes arose between them.
Abd&#257;l, s. &#703;Al&#299; R&#257;y, who was the eldest of his
children, through this jealousy sought the patronage of the Khan of
Kashghar and made him his protector, so that when &#703;Al&#299;
R&#257;y, who was very old and decrepit, should die, he might, under
the protection of the W&#257;li of Kashghar, become ruler of Tibet.
&#703;Al&#299; R&#257;y, suspecting that the brothers might attack
&#703;Al&#299; Muh&#803;ammad, and a disturbance might arise in his
country, sent him to Court, his desire being that he might be attached
to this Court, and his affairs might prosper by service to and kindness
shown by the Court.</p>
<p class="par">On the 1st of the Il&#257;h&#299; month of
Isfand&#257;rmuz I pitched in the pargana of Umbala.
Las&#863;hkar&#299;, s. Im&#257;m-wird&#299;, who had run away from
B&#299;-daulat, and joined the service of my auspicious son
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z, having come on this date to Court, kissed
the threshold. A report came from my son and Mah&#257;bat K. It
contained the recommendation and the offer of service of
&#703;&#256;dil K., with a letter which he had sent to Mah&#257;bat, in
which were set forth his submissiveness and loyalty.
Las&#863;hkar&#299; was sent back to Parw&#299;z with a dress of
honour, a <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> with pearl buttons for the prince,
and a dress of honour for K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam and
Mah&#257;bat K. At the request of my son I wrote a gracious farman to
&#703;&#256;dil K. showing great favour to him, and sent him a robe of
honour with a special <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i>. I gave an order that if
they thought fit they should send the above-mentioned<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e17119src" href="#xd24e17119" name="xd24e17119src">53</a> to
&#703;&#256;dil K.</p>
<p class="par">On the 5th I alighted at the garden of Sihrind. On the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb289" href="#v2pb289" name=
"v2pb289">289</a>]</span>bank of the Beas &#7778;&#257;diq K.,
Muk&#863;ht&#257;r K., Isfandiy&#257;r, R&#257;ja R&#363;p Chand of
Gwalior, and other Amirs who had been appointed to support him, having
succeeded in restoring order in the northern hill-country, had the good
fortune to kiss the threshold. The facts, briefly, are that Jagat
Singh, at the instigation of B&#299;-daulat, had taken to the hills
above-mentioned, and engaged in stirring up sedition and strife. As the
field was clear (<i>i.e.</i>, there was no one to oppose him) he passed
over difficult mountains and defiles, and by attacking and plundering
peasantry and the weak, heaped misfortune on them until
&#7778;&#257;diq K. arrived. He brought the Zamindars under control by
means of fears and hopes, and made the overthrow of that wretched
creature the object of his exertions. Jagat Singh strengthened the fort
of Mau, and was protected by it. Whenever he found an opportunity he
left that fortress and fought with the royal servants. At last his
provisions were exhausted, and he came to despair of assistance from
the other Zamindars. The elevation of his younger brother became a
source of disturbance and anxiety to him. Helplessly he then sought for
patronage, and begged the protection of N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam,
expressing shame and contrition, and sought a refuge in her mediation.
In order to please and satisfy her, the pen of pardon was drawn through
the record of his faults.</p>
<p class="par">On this day reports came in from the officials in the
Deccan that B&#299;-daulat, with La&#703;natu-llah, D&#257;r&#257;b,
and other wretched (with broken wing and feathers) creatures in
miserable condition, with blackened faces, had gone from the borders of
Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk&rsquo;s territory towards Orissa and Bengal. In this
journey great loss fell on him and his companions, many of whom, when a
chance offered, with bare heads and feet, and having washed their hands
of life (desperate), took to flight. Out of these one day
M&#299;rz&#257; Muh&#803;ammad, s. Afz&#803;al K., his Diwan, with his
mother and his family, ran away during the march, and when the news
reached B&#299;-daulat, he sent Ja&#703;far and
K&#863;h&#257;n-qul&#299; Uzbeg and some others of his confidential men
in pursuit of him, that, if they could take him alive, well and good,
or otherwise they should cut off his head and bring it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb290" href="#v2pb290" name=
"v2pb290">290</a>]</span>into his presence. They with all speed
proceeded and caught him up on the road. Becoming aware of this, he
sent his mother and family into the jungles and hid them there, and
himself with a body of young men whom he relied on as companions,
planted manfully the foot of courage and stood with their bows. In
front of them there was a canal and a swamp (<i>chihl&#257;</i>).
Sayyid Ja&#703;far K. wished to approach near him and take him with him
by deceiving him, but however much he tried to persuade him by
threatening and holding out hopes, it had no effect, and he answered
him with life-taking arrows. He made a good fight of it, and sent
K&#863;h&#257;n-qul&#299; and some others of B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s men
to hell. Sayyid Ja&#703;far also was wounded. Finally M&#299;rz&#257;
Muh&#803;ammad received severe wounds and gambled away the cash of his
life. But as long as he had breath he deprived many thereof. After he
was killed, they cut off his head and took it to B&#299;-daulat.</p>
<p class="par">When B&#299;-daulat was defeated near Delhi and went to
Mandu, he sent Afz&#803;al K. to get assistance and support from
&#703;&#256;dil K. and others, forwarding with him an armlet
(<i>b&#257;z&#363;-band</i>) for &#703;&#256;dil K., and a horse, an
elephant, and a jewelled sword for &#703;Ambar. He first went to
&#703;Ambar. After delivering his message he produced what
B&#299;-daulat had sent for him, but &#703;Ambar would not accept them,
saying he was the servant of &#703;&#256;dil K., who was at present the
head of those in power in the Deccan: he should go first to him and
explain what he desired. If he agreed, his slave would ally himself to
and obey him, and in that case he would take whatever was sent,
otherwise not. Afz&#803;al K. went to &#703;&#256;dil K., who received
him very badly, and for a long time kept him outside the city and did
not look into his affair, but put all kinds of slights upon him, but
secretly asked for what B&#299;-daulat had sent for him and
&#703;Ambar, and took possession of it. The aforesaid (Afz&#803;al K.)
was there when he heard the news of the killing of his son and the ruin
of his family, and so fell upon evil days. In short, B&#299;-daulat, in
spite of all his (original) good fortune and happy auspices, undertook
a long and distant journey, and came to the port of Machhl&#299; Patan
(Masulipatam), which belongs to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb291"
href="#v2pb291" name="v2pb291">291</a>]</span>Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk.
Before reaching this place, he sent some of his men to
Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk, and besought him for all sorts of assistance and
companionship. Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk sent him a small amount of cash and
goods for his support, and wrote to the warden of his frontier to
conduct him in safety out of his territory, and encourage the
grain-sellers and Zamindars to send grain and all other necessaries to
his camp.</p>
<p class="par">On the 27th of the month a strange event took place.
Returning from the hunting-place, I had come back to the camp at night.
By chance I crossed a stream of water, the bed of which was very rocky
and the water running violently. One of the servants of the
<i>s&#863;harbat-k&#863;h&#257;na</i> (wine-cellar) was conveying a
huntsman&rsquo;s relish. He had a gold tray, which contained a salver
and five cups. There were covers to the cups, and the whole was in a
cotton bag. When he was crossing, his foot slipped and the tray fell
out of his hand. As the water was deep and running rapidly, however
much they searched and beat their hands and feet (exerted themselves),
no trace of it could be found. Next day the state of the case was
reported to me, and I ordered a number of boatmen and huntsmen to go to
the place and make a careful search, and it perhaps might appear. By
chance, in the place where it had fallen it was found, and more strange
still, it had not been turned upside down, and not a drop of water had
got into the cups. This affair is similar to what happened when
H&#257;d&#299; was seated on the throne of the Khalifate. A ruby ring
had been inherited by H&#257;r&#363;n from his father. H&#257;d&#299;
sent a slave to H&#257;r&#363;n and asked for it. It happened that at
that time H&#257;r&#363;n was seated on the bank of the Tigris. The
slave gave the message, and H&#257;r&#363;n, enraged, said: &ldquo;I
have allowed thee<a class="noteref" id="xd24e17148src" href=
"#xd24e17148" name="xd24e17148src">54</a> to have the Khalifate, and
thou dost not allow me one ring.&rdquo; In his rage he threw the ring
into the Tigris. After some months by the decree of fate H&#257;d&#299;
died, and the turn of the Khalifate came to H&#257;r&#363;n. He ordered
divers to look for the ring in the place where he had thrown it. By the
chances of destiny, and the aid of good fortune, at the first dive the
ring was found, and brought and given into H&#257;r&#363;n&rsquo;s
hand! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb292" href="#v2pb292" name=
"v2pb292">292</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">At this time one day on the hunting ground the chief
huntsman Im&#257;m-wird&#299; brought before me a partridge that had a
spur on one leg and not on the other. As the way to distinguish the
female lies in the spur, by way of testing me he asked whether this was
a male or a female. I said at once &ldquo;A female.&rdquo; When they
opened it an egg appeared inside (<i>p&#299;s&#863;h&#299;na</i>) its
belly. The people who were in attendance asked with surprise by what
sign I had discovered this: I said that the head and beak of the female
are shorter than the male&rsquo;s. By investigation and often seeing
(the birds) I had acquired this dexterity.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e17157src" href="#xd24e17157" name="xd24e17157src">55</a> It is a
strange thing that the windpipe in all animals
(<i>h&#803;aiw&#257;n&#257;t</i>), which the Turks call
<i>h&#803;alq</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e17181src" href=
"#xd24e17181" name="xd24e17181src">56</a> is single from the top of the
throat to the crop (<i>ch&#299;na-d&#257;n</i>), while in the case of
the bustard (<i>jarz</i>) it is different. In the bustard it is for
four finger-breadths from the top of the throat single and then it
divides into two branches and in this form reaches the crop. Also at
the place where it divides into two branches there is a stoppage
(<i>sar-band</i>) and a knot (<i>girih</i>) is felt by the hand. In the
<i>kulang</i> (crane) it is still stranger. In it the windpipe passes
in a serpentine manner between the bones of the breast to the rump and
then turns back from there and joins the throat. The <i>jarz</i> or
<i>charz</i> (bustard) is of two kinds: one is a mottled black and the
other <i>b&#363;r</i> (a kind of dun colour). I now<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e17219src" href="#xd24e17219" name="xd24e17219src">57</a>
discovered that there are not two kinds, but that which is a mottled
black is the male, and that which is dun-coloured is the female. The
proof of it is this, that in the piebald there are testicles and in the
dun one there are eggs; this has been repeatedly found on
examination.</p>
<p class="par">I have a great liking for fish, and all kinds of good
fish are brought for me; the best fish in Hindustan is the
<i>roh&#363;</i>, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb293" href=
"#v2pb293" name="v2pb293">293</a>]</span>after that the

"#xd24e17233" name="xd24e17233src">58</a> Both have scales, and in
appearance and shape are like each other. Everyone cannot at once
distinguish between them. The difference in their flesh also is very
small, but the connoisseur discovers that the flesh of the
<i>roh&#363;</i> is rather more agreeable of the two. <span class=

Ahmadabad is the S&#863;h&#257;h&#299;, for which see the Bombay
Gazetteer, vol. for Ahmadabad, p. 283. But besides being
S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n in the MSS. it is also S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n
in the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, 207. The S&#863;h&#257;h&#299; garden lies
to the north of Ahmadabad, and &#7778;af&#299; was at the south or
south-east of the city. Perhaps the S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n garden was
near the Malik S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n lake, which was east of the
city, and is referred to in Bombay Gazetteer, p. 18. The

each of them that of 1,000. Sard&#257;r K., having come from Kangra,
had the good fortune to pay his respects. At this time I gave orders to
the <i>yas&#257;wuls</i> and men of the <i>yas&#257;q</i> (guards) that
hereafter at the time when I came out of the palace they should keep
away defective people, such as the blind, and those whose noses and
ears had been cut off, the leprous and the maimed, and all kinds of
sick people, and not permit them to be seen. On the 19th the feast of
the culmination was held. Il&#257;h-wird&#299;, the brother of
Im&#257;m-wird&#299;, had run away from B&#299;-daulat and came to

Allahabad and Behar, and if the Subahdar of Bengal could not forestall

of the victorious army which is in the shadow of the flag of my son. By
way of precaution on the 2nd Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht I gave my son
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n leave to proceed to Agra to remain in that
neighbourhood and wait for a sign. If there should happen to be any
necessity for a particular service and an order should be given him, he
must act as occasion might require. I sent him a special dress of
honour, with a <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> with pearl buttons, a special
jewelled sword, and to A&#7779;&#257;lat K., his son, a horse, and a

Singh. I hope that her coming will be auspicious to the State. He also
wrote that, having sent for Turkum&#257;n K. from Pattan he had
appointed &#703;Az&#299;zu-llah in his place. J&#257;n-sip&#257;r K.,
also by order, came and waited on me. When B&#299;-daulat crossed the
Burhanpur river and took the road of ruin, M&#299;r
H&#803;us&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n, considering his own evil deeds, could not
remain at Burhanpur. Taking his children with him, he conveyed the
goods of ruin to the Deccan, in order that he might pass his days under
the protection of &#703;&#256;dil K. By chance, as he passed by
B&#299;r, J&#257;n-sip&#257;r K. obtained information, and sent a body
of men to head him off. He seized him and his dependants, and brought
them before Mah&#257;bat. Mah&#257;bat placed him in confinement, and
took from him Rs. 1,00,000 in cash and goods. (Also) J&#257;do R&#257;y
and &#362;day R&#257;m had taken the elephants which B&#299;-daulat had
left in Burhanpur and brought them to the prince (Parw&#299;z).</p>
<p class="par">Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z, who
had come to Delhi from B&#299;-daulat in order to state his objects,
had not been allowed by me an opportunity to speak and I had handed him
over to Mah&#257;bat K. After his (B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s) defeat and
ruin Mah&#257;bat K. had made him his own servant. As he was an old
friend of &#703;&#256;dil K., and was for some years at
B&#299;j&#257;p&#363;r as Vakil of K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n.
Mah&#257;bat K. now sent him again as his representative<a class=

looking to the necessities of the time and the upshot of affairs, were
contented and professed loyalty and desire for service. The rebel
&#703;Ambar sent one of his confidential men of the name of
&#703;Al&#299; S&#863;h&#299;r, and displayed great humility. He
(&#703;Ambar) wrote in the capacity of a servant to Mah&#257;bat K.,
and engaged that he (&#703;Ambar) should come to
Dewalg&#257;on<a class="noteref" id="xd24e17287src" href="#xd24e17287"
name="xd24e17287src">2</a> and wait upon Mah&#257;bat. He would make
his eldest son a servant of the State, and keep him in the service of
my auspicious son. About this time there arrived a letter from
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z that &#703;&#256;dil
K. from the bottom of his heart had elected for service and loyalty,
and agreed that he would send Mull&#257; Muh&#803;ammad L&#257;r&#299;,
who was his principal agent and minister, and whom both in spoken and
written messages he called Mull&#257; B&#257;b&#257;, with 5,000 horse,
that he might remain continually on duty, and they might know that
other<a class="noteref" id="xd24e17290src" href="#xd24e17290" name=
"xd24e17290src">3</a> troops would follow (?). Urgent farmans had been
sent that my son should proceed to Allahabad and Behar in order to
overthrow B&#299;-daulat. At this time news arrived that
notwithstanding the rainy season and the violence of the rain, that
son, on the 6th Farward&#299;n had marched out of Burhanpur with the
army of fortune, and had taken up his quarters in L&#257;l
B&#257;g&#863;h,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e17293src" href=
"#xd24e17293" name="xd24e17293src">4</a> and that Mah&#257;bat K. was
awaiting at Burhanpur the arrival of Mull&#257; Muh&#803;ammad
L&#257;r&#299;, so that when he arrived he would relieve himself of the
care of the maintenance of order in that neighbourhood, and come with
him (Muh&#803;ammad L&#257;r&#299;) to wait on my son. Las&#863;hkar
K., J&#257;do R&#257;y, &#362;day R&#257;m, and other servants of the
State had been ordered to go to the B&#257;l&#257;g&#863;h&#257;t (the
country above the Ghats), and remain at Z&#804;afarnagar. Having given
J&#257;n-s&#299;p&#257;r K. leave as before, he (Parw&#299;z) kept Asad
K. Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299; at Elichpur. Min&#363;chihr, s.
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K., was appointed to
J&#257;ln&#257;p&#363;r. He sent Riz&#803;aw&#299; K. to Th&#257;lner,
to guard the province of Khandesh.</p>
<p class="par">On this day news came that Las&#863;hkar&#299; had taken
the farman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb297" href="#v2pb297" name=
"v2pb297">297</a>]</span>to &#703;&#256;dil K., and he, having
decorated the city, had gone out four koss to meet him, and had
performed salutations and prostrations for the farman and the dress of
honour. On the 21st I sent dresses of honour for my son
D&#257;war-bak&#863;hs&#863;h and K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am and
&#7778;af&#299; K. Having appointed &#7778;&#257;diq K. to the
government of Lahore, and given him a dress of honour and an elephant,
I gave him leave. An order was given that he should have the mansab of
400 personal and 400 horse. Multafat K., s. M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam,
raised the head of distinction with the mansab of 1,500 personal and
300 horse.</p>
<p class="par">One day while hunting it was reported to me that a snake
with a black hood (<i>kafcha</i>) had swallowed another hooded
(<i>kafcha?</i>) snake and gone into a hole. I ordered them to dig up
the place and bring out the snake. Without exaggeration I had never
seen a snake of this size. When, they opened its belly, the hood of the
snake that it had swallowed came out whole. Although this snake was of
another kind, in length and girth little difference was visible.</p>
<p class="par">At this time it was represented to me in a
report<a class="noteref" id="xd24e17310src" href="#xd24e17310" name=
"xd24e17310src">5</a> by the news writer of the Deccan that
Mah&#257;bat K. had ordered &#703;&#256;rif s. Z&#257;hid to be
executed, and had put him (<i>i.e.</i>, Z&#257;hid), with two other
sons, in prison. It appeared that that wretched man had written with
his own hand a petition to B&#299;-daulat representing on the part of
his father and himself his loyalty, sincerity, repentance, and shame.
By fate that letter fell into the hands of Mah&#257;bat K. Having sent
for &#703;&#256;rif into his presence he showed him the letter. As he
had written a decree for his own blood, he could not make any
acceptable excuse, and of necessity he was executed, and his father and
brothers imprisoned.</p>
<p class="par">On the 1st K&#863;hurd&#257;d it was reported that
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K. &#703;Arab, had died a natural death in the
Deccan. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb298" href="#v2pb298" name=

<p class="par">At this time a report came from Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K.
Fath&#803;-jang that B&#299;-daulat had entered Orissa. The particulars
of this are that between the boundary<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e17321src" href="#xd24e17321" name="xd24e17321src">6</a> of Orissa
and the Deccan there is a barrier. On one side there are lofty
mountains, and on the other swamps and a river. The ruler of Golconda
had also erected a wall (<i>dar-band</i>) and a fort, and armed it with
muskets and cannon. The passage of men by that closed route was
impracticable without the leave of Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk. B&#299;-daulat,
with the guidance of Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk, having passed by that route,
entered the country of Orissa. It happened that at this time
Ah&#803;mad Beg K., nephew of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K., had attacked the
Zamindars of Khurda. At this strange occurrence, which happened without
precedent or news or information, he became confused and bewildered and
without seeing a remedy gave up his campaign, and came to the village
of Bulbul&#299;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e17327src" href="#xd24e17327"
name="xd24e17327src">7</a> (P&#299;pl&#299;), the seat of the governor
of that Subah (Orissa). He then took his women with him and hastened to
Cuttack, which is 12 koss from P&#299;pl&#299; towards Bengal. As the
time was short, he had not leisure to collect troops and arrange his
affairs. He did not feel himself equal to a war with B&#299;-daulat,
and he had not with him associates such as were necessary, so he went
on from Cuttack to Bardwan, of which &#7778;&#257;lih&#803;, nephew of
&#256;&#7779;af K. deceased, was the Jagirdar. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb299" href="#v2pb299" name=
"v2pb299">299</a>]</span>At first &#7778;&#257;lih&#803; was
astonished<a class="noteref" id="xd24e17334src" href="#xd24e17334"
name="xd24e17334src">8</a>, and did not believe that B&#299;-daulat was
coming, until a letter came from La&#703;natu-llah to conciliate him.
&#7778;&#257;lih&#803; fortified Bardwan and remained in it.
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K. was surprised on hearing the terrible news. Though
most of his auxiliaries and soldiers were scattered in the villages
round about and unprocurable, he yet planted the foot of courage firmly
in Akbarnagar (Rajmahal), and set himself to strengthen the fort and
collect troops, and encourage the heads of tribes and retainers. He
prepared the things necessary for his guns and other weapons and for
battle. In the meanwhile a notice came to him from B&#299;-daulat that
by the decree of God and the ordinances of heaven what was not suitable
to him had appeared from the womb of non-existence. By the revolving of
crooked-moving time and the changes of night and day his passage
towards these regions had come to pass. Although to the view of manly
courage the extent and breadth of that country were not more than an
exercising-ground, or rather than a rubbish-heap
(<i>pur-k&#257;h&#299;</i>, &ldquo;full of straw&rdquo;), and his aims
were higher, yet as he had to pass by this way, he could not pass for
nothing. If it were Ibr&#257;h&#299;m&rsquo;s determination to go to
the royal Court, he (S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n) would hold back the
hand of injury from him and his family, and he might go to Court with
an easy mind. If he considered it advisable to stay, he would bestow
upon him any corner of the country he might ask for.</p>

&ldquo;the Pass of Chhatar Diw&#257;r,&rdquo; and is described as the
boundary between Orissa and Telingana, and is two koss from
Khairap&#257;ra. One Man&#7779;&#363;r, a servant of

latter place is in the Balasore district, and nearer Bengal than
Cuttack. Curiously enough Pipli or Pippli is not given in the I.G. new

the Puri district (I.G., new ed., XX. 404). In the

of the words <i>takl&#299;f-i-Musalm&#257;n&#299; bar kas&#299;

that the words <i>takl&#299;f-i-Musalm&#257;n&#299;</i> should be
rendered &lsquo;the Muhammadan ceremonial.&rsquo; This explains why the
injunction comes in immediately after the prohibitions against blinding
and mutilation. It has been said, and I believe with truth, that the

reason for this was that in many instances they had Hindu mothers. As

K&#863;h&#257;n, and apparently the title of I&#703;tiq&#257;d was
transferred to his younger brother (or cousin?)
S&#863;h&#257;hp&#363;r, who was afterwards governor of Kashmir. See

According to Vullers&rsquo; Dict., i, 482, a <i>t&#363;lcha</i> is 96
grains or about half a tola. The
G&#863;h&#299;yas&#804;u-l-log&#863;h&#257;t, however, says that
<i>t&#363;lcha</i> is merely the Persian form of the
Hindust&#257;n&#299; <i>t&#363;l&#257;</i>. According to the
Burhan-i-q&#257;ti&#702; a tola is only 2&frac12; m&#257;sha in Upper
India. Generally it is reckoned as 12 m&#257;sha. According to Sir

This seems to be the case of matricide mentioned in Terry&rsquo;s

matricide was put to death by being bitten by two snakes. See also
Irvine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Manucci,&rdquo; iv, 422. Apparently the
punishment recorded by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r took place on the 4th
February, for Sir Thomas Roe mentions that they reached

<h2 class="main">Addendum</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Mr. Berthold Laufer&rsquo;s paper on &ldquo;Walrus
and Narwhal Ivory,&rdquo; reprinted at Leyden, 1913, from the <i>Toung
Pao</i>, throws light on J&#257;h&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s remarks about
fish-tooth dagger-hilts. It now seems certain that they were made of
the canine tooth of the walrus, or the horn of the narwhal. Possibly
one reason why J&#257;h&#257;ng&#299;r attached so much value to the
fish-teeth was because they were supposed to be an antidote to poison.
He was fond of such things, and one day, when he was heir-apparent,
Father Jerome Xavier found him engaged at Fath&#803;p&#363;r in
extracting copper from peacocks&rsquo; tails, on account of its
supposed antitoxine properties.</p>
<p class="par">It is stated in Mr. Laufer&rsquo;s paper, pp. 13 and 15,
that walrus-teeth were supposed to be also useful in reducing
swellings. As they were often made into knife-handles, it is not
improbable that the knife which a Rajah of Cochin appears to have sent
to Akbar in 1569 (Akbar-n&#257;ma, i. 342) was, wholly or in part, made
of walrus ivory. The Rajah said that whenever it was applied to a
swelling it reduced it, and Akbar told Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l that over
200 persons had benefited by touching it.</p>
<p class="par">In the British Museum there is a fascinating set of
chessmen made of walrus or narwhal ivory. They were discovered in the
island of Lewis in 1831, but are supposed to be as old as the twelfth
century. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb301" href="#v2pb301" name=

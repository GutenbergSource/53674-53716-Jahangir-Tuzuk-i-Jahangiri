<HTML><BODY>A very interesting autobiography of Jahangir (August 31, 1569 – October 28, 1627), the Mughal emperor of India from 1605 till 1627.

<p>Every work has its catch, and with this one it is the number of accents used (and not caught by the OCR) Please supply them in P1 according to the following table (Note that this can take 5 to 10 minutes per page):

<pre style='color: red; font-weight: bold'>
[']     apostrophe when used for hamza (only in middle of Persian or
        Arabic names)
[`]     reversed apostrophe (used for ayin)
</pre>

Diacritics Above Letter

<pre>
[=a]	a with macron
[=i]	i with macron (sometimes hard to distinguish from plain i)
[=o]	o with macron
[=u]	u with macron
[.z]	z with dot above
</pre>

Diacritics Below Letter

<pre>
[d.]	d with dot below
[gh]	gh with bar below (underline) (No need to indicate underbar 
        with some special sign, putting these together is enough to 
        indicate the combination). An alternative would be to write
        [g=][h=], but this is considerably more typing.
[h.]	h with dot below
[k.]	k with dot below
[kh]	kh with bar below (underline) (see [gh])
[r.]	r with dot below
[s.]	s with dot below
[s:]	s with two dots below
[sh]	sh with bar below (underline) (see [gh])
[t.]	t with dot below
[t:]	t with two dots below
[z:]	z with two dots below
[z=]	z with bar below
</pre>

<p>The accents are mainly used on proper names. Near the beginning of the book is a <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/tools/project_manager/displayimage.php?project=projectID4611601ee654e&imagefile=011.png">table of these accents</a> and the matching Arabic letters.

<p>A few words in Arabic script (and Devanagari) will appear. I will transcribe these in PP. Please mark them [Arabic: *] and [Devanagari: *]

<p>Given the large number of accents missed in OCR, I will only prepare a Good Words list after this work completes P1.

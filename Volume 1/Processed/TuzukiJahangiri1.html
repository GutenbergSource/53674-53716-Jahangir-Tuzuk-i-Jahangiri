<p class="par first">Mr. Rogers translated the Memoirs of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r several years ago from the edition which Sayyid
Ah&#803;mad printed at Ghazipur in 1863 and at Allyghur in 1864.
Orientalists are greatly indebted to the Sayyid for his disinterested
labours, but his text seems to have been made from a single and
defective MS. and is often incorrect, especially in the case of proper
names. I have collated it with the excellent MSS. in the India Office
and the British Museum, and have thus been able to make numerous
corrections. I have also consulted the MS. in the Library of the
R.A.S., but it is not a good one. I have, with Mr. Rogers&rsquo;s
permission, revised the translation, and I have added many notes.</p>
<p class="par">There is an account of the Memoirs in the sixth volume
of Elliot &amp; Dowson&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of India,&rdquo; and
there the subject of the various recensions is discussed. There is also
a valuable note by Dr. Rieu in his &ldquo;Catalogue of Persian
MSS.,&rdquo; i, 253. It is there pointed out that there is a manuscript
translation of the first nine years of the Memoirs by William Erskine
in the British Museum. I have consulted this translation and found it
helpful. The MS. is numbered Add. 26,611. The translation is, of
course, excellent, and it was made from a good MS.</p>
<p class="par">A translation of what Dr. Rieu calls the garbled Memoirs
of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r was made by Major David Price and published by
the Oriental Translation Committee of the Royal Asiatic Society in
1829. The author of this work is unknown, and its history is an
unsolved problem. It is occasionally fuller than the genuine Memoirs,
and it contains some picturesque touches, such as the account

"xd24e248">viii</a>]</span>of Akbar&rsquo;s deathbed. But it is certain
that it is, in part at least, a fabrication, and that it contains
statements which Jah&#257;ng&#299;r could never have made. Compare, for
instance, the account of the death of Sohr&#257;b, the son of
M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam, near the end of Price&rsquo;s translation, pp.
138&ndash;9, with that given in the genuine Memoirs in the narrative of
the fifteenth year of the reign, p. 293, and also in the
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, p. 139. Besides being inaccurate, the garbled or
spurious Memoirs are much shorter than the genuine work, and do not go
beyond the fifteenth year. Price&rsquo;s translation, too, was made
from a single and badly written MS.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e250src"
href="#xd24e250" name="xd24e250src">1</a> which is now in the R.A.S.
library. Dr. Rieu remarks that it is to be regretted that so poor a
fabrication as the garbled Memoirs should have been given to the world
as a genuine production of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r. This being so, it is
appropriate that the present translation of the genuine Memoirs should
be published by the Royal Asiatic Society.</p>
<p class="par">When Jah&#257;ng&#299;r had written his Memoirs for the
first twelve years of his reign he made them into a volume, and had a
number of copies made and distributed (Elliot, vi, 360). The first of
these he gave to S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n, who was then in high
favour. The present publication is a translation of the first volume of
the Memoirs, but the translation of the whole Memoirs, together with
the additions of Mu&#703;tamad K&#863;h&#257;n and Muh&#803;ammad
H&#257;d&#299;, has been completed, and it is to be hoped that its
publication will follow in due course.</p>
<p class="par">Jah&#257;ng&#299;r reigned for twenty-two years, but
ill-health and sorrow made him give up the writing of his Memoirs in
the seventeenth year of his reign (see Elliot, vi, 280). He then
entrusted the task to Mu&#703;tamad K&#863;h&#257;n, the author
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e257" href="#xd24e257" name=
"xd24e257">ix</a>]</span>of the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, who continued the
Memoirs to the beginning of the nineteenth year. He then dropped
writing the Memoirs in the name of the emperor, but he continued the
narrative of the reign, to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s death, in his own
work, the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma. Muh&#803;ammad H&#257;d&#299;
afterwards continued the Memoirs down to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s
death, but his work is little more than an abridgment of the
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma. Sayyid Ah&#803;mad&rsquo;s edition contains the
continuations of the Memoirs by Mu&#703;tamad and Muh&#803;ammad
H&#257;d&#299;, and also Muh&#803;ammad H&#257;d&#299;&rsquo;s preface
and introduction. But this preface and introduction have not been
translated by Mr. Rogers, and I do not think that a translation is
necessary. Muh&#803;ammad H&#257;d&#299; is a late writer (see Elliot,
vi, 392), his date being the first quarter of the eighteenth century,
and his introduction seems to be almost wholly derived from the
Ma&#702;&#257;s&#804;ir-i-Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; of K&#257;mg&#257;r
H&#803;usain&#299; (Elliot, vi, 257). It consists mainly of an account
of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s life from his birth up to his
accession.</p>
<p class="par">It is perhaps unnecessary to say anything about the
importance of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s Memoirs. They give a lively
picture of India in the early decades of the seventeenth century, and
are a valuable supplement to the Akbar-n&#257;ma. I may be allowed,
however, to end this preface with the following remarks which I
contributed to the <i>Indian Magazine</i> for May, 1907:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Royal authors of the East had more blood in
them than those kings whose works have been catalogued by Horace
Walpole. To find a parallel to them we must go back to Julius
C&aelig;sar, and even then the advantage is not upon the side of
Europe. After all, the commentaries of the famous Roman are a little
disappointing, and certainly the Memoirs of B&#257;bar and
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r are far more human and fuller of matter than the
story of the Gallic Wars. All Muhammadans have a fancy for writing
chronicles and autobiographies, and several Muhammadan <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e266" href="#xd24e266" name=
"xd24e266">x</a>]</span>kings have yielded to the common impulse.
Central Asia has given us the Memoirs of Tamarlane, B&#257;bar, and
H&#803;aidar, and the chronicle of Abu-l-ghazi; Persia has given us the
Memoirs of Shah Tahmasp, and India the Memoirs of the Princess Gulbadan
and Jah&#257;ng&#299;r. In modern times we see the same impulse at
work, for we have the biography of the late Ameer of Afghanistan and
the diary of the Shah of Persia.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The contributions to literature by Royal authors
which come to us from the East form a department by themselves, and one
which is of great value. Nearly all Eastern histories are disfigured by
adulation. Even when the author has had no special reason for flattery
and for suppression of truth, he has been dazzled by the greatness of
his subject, and gives us a picture which no more reveals the real king
than does a telescope the real constitution of the Morning Star. But
when Eastern monarchs give us chronicles, the case is different. They
have no occasion for fear or favour, and mercilessly expose the
failings of their contemporaries. Not that they are to be trusted any
more than other Orientals when speaking of themselves. B&#257;bar has
suppressed the story of his vassalage to Shah Isma&#703;&#299;l, of his
defeat at Ghajdaw&#257;n, and his treatment of &#703;&#256;lam Lodi;
and Jah&#257;ng&#299;r has glossed over his rebellion against his
father, and the circumstances of Sh&#299;r-&#257;fgan&rsquo;s death.
But when they have to speak of others&mdash;whether kings or
nobles&mdash;they give us the whole truth, and perhaps a little more.
An amiable Princess like Gulbadan Begam may veil the faults and
weaknesses of her brothers Hum&#257;y&#363;n and Hind&#257;l; but
B&#257;bar strips the gilt off nearly every one whom he mentions, and
spares no one&mdash;not even his own father.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Memoirs of B&#257;bar, H&#803;aidar, and
Gulbadan have been translated into English, and those of T&#804;ahmasp
have been translated into German; but unfortunately
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e272"
href="#xd24e272" name="xd24e272">xi</a>]</span>have never been fully
translated,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e274src" href="#xd24e274" name=
"xd24e274src">2</a> though there are extracts in Elliot &amp;
Dowson&rsquo;s History, and Major Price many years ago gave us from an
imperfect manuscript a garbled account of a few years of his Memoirs.
Yet in reality Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s Memoirs are not inferior in
interest to those of B&#257;bar. Indeed, we may go further and say
there is twice as much matter in them as in B&#257;bar&rsquo;s Memoirs,
and that they are by far the most entertaining of the two works. Not
that Jah&#257;ng&#299;r was by any means as remarkable a man as his
great-grandfather. He was a most faulty human being, and his own
account of himself often excites our disgust and contempt. But he had
the sense not to confine his narrative to an account of himself, and he
has given us a picture of his father, the great Akbar, which is a
bigger &lsquo;plum&rsquo; than anything in B&#257;bar&rsquo;s Memoirs.
But his account of himself has also its charm, for it reveals the real
man, and so he lives for us in his Memoirs just as James VI&mdash;to
whom, and to the Emperor Claudius, he bears a strange and even
ludicrous resemblance&mdash;lives in the &lsquo;Fortunes of
Nigel&rsquo; or Claudius in Suetonius and Tacitus. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
was indeed a strange mixture. The man who could stand by and see men
flayed alive, and who, as he himself tells us, put one man to death and
had two others hamstrung because they showed themselves inopportunely
and frightened away his game, could yet be a lover of justice and could
spend his Thursday evenings in holding high converse. He could quote
F&#299;rd&#363;si&rsquo;s verse against cruelty to animals&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Ah! spare yon emmet, rich in hoarded
grain&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">He lives with pleasure, and he dies with
pain&rsquo;;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">and be soft-hearted enough to wish that his father
were alive to share with him the delicious mangoes of India. He could
procure the murder of Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l and avow <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e285" href="#xd24e285" name=
"xd24e285">xii</a>]</span>the fact without remorse, and also pity the
royal elephants because they shivered in winter when they sprinkled
themselves with cold water. &lsquo;I observed this,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;and so I ordered that the water should be heated to the
temperature of luke-warm milk.&rsquo; And he adds: &lsquo;This was
entirely my own idea; nobody had ever thought of it before.&rsquo; One
good trait in Jah&#257;ng&#299;r was his hearty enjoyment of Nature and
his love for flowers. B&#257;bar had this also, but he was old, or at
least worn out, when he came to India, and he was disgusted by an
Indian attempt to poison him, and so his description of India is meagre
and splenetic. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, on the other hand, is a true Indian,
and dwells delightedly on the charms of Indian flowers, particularises
the pal&#257;s, the bok&#363;l, and the champa, and avows that no fruit
of Afghanistan or Central Asia is equal to the mango. He loved, too, to
converse with pandits and Hindu ascetics, though he is contemptuous of
their avatars, and causes the image of Vishnu as the boar avatar to be
broken and flung into the Pushkar lake.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is a remark of Hallam&rsquo;s that the best
attribute of Muhammadan princes is a rigorous justice in chastising the
offences of others. Of this quality Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, in spite of all
his weaknesses, had a large share, and even to this day he is spoken of
with respect by Muhammadans on account of his love of justice. It is a
pathetic circumstance that it was this princely quality which was to
some extent the cause of the great affront put upon him by Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n. Many complaints had been made to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r of
the oppressions of Mah&#257;bat in Bengal, and crowds of suppliants had
come to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s camp. It was his desire to give them
redress and to punish Mah&#257;bat for his exactions, together with his
physical and mental weakness, which led to his capture on the banks of
the Jhilam.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One of the many interesting observations in his
Memoirs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e291" href="#xd24e291" name=
"xd24e291">xiii</a>]</span>is his account of an inscription he saw at
Hindaun. He says that in the thirteenth year of his reign, as he was
marching back to Agra, he found a verse by someone inscribed on the
pillar of a pleasure-house on an islet in the lake at Hindaun. He then
proceeds to quote it, and it turns out to be one of Omar
Khayyam&rsquo;s! This is FitzGerald&rsquo;s paraphrase:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;For some we loved, the loveliest and the
best</p>
<p class="line xd24e296">That from his vintage Time hath prest,</p>
<p class="line">Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,</p>
<p class="line xd24e296">And one by one crept silently to
rest.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">&ldquo;The same quatrain has also been quoted by
Baday&#363;n&#299; in his history, and the interesting thing about
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s quotation of it is that he could see the
beauty of the verse and at the same time did not know who was the
author. There is also an interest in the fact that the third line
contains a different reading from that given in Whinfield&rsquo;s
edition of the text. Hindaun is in the Jaipur territory, and one would
like to know if the inscription still exists.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Among other things in Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s
Memoirs there is the description of the outbreak of the Plague, given
to him by a lady of his court [which has been quoted by Dr. Simpson in
his book upon Plague], and there is a very full account of Kashmir,
which is considerably superior to that in the &#256;y&#299;n
Akbar&#299;, which Sir Walter Lawrence has praised.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">With reference to the portrait of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
prefixed to this volume, it may be interesting to note that it appears
from Mr. E. B. Havell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Indian Sculpture,&rdquo; p. 203,
that the British Museum possesses a drawing by Rembrandt which was
copied from a Moghul miniature, and which has been pronounced by Mr.
Rouffaer to be a portrait of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r. Coryat (Purchas,
reprint, iv, 473) thus describes Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s personal
appearance:&mdash;&ldquo;He is fifty and three years of age, his
nativity-day having been celebrated with wonderful pomp since my
arrival here. On that day he weighed himself in a pair of golden
scales, which by great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e308" href=
"#xd24e308" name="xd24e308">xiv</a>]</span>chance I saw the same day; a
custom he observes most inviolably every year. He is of complexion
neither white nor black, but of a middle betwixt them. I know not how
to express it with a more expressive and significant epitheton than
olive. An olive colour his face presenteth. He is of a seemly
composition of body, of a stature little unequal (as I guess not
without grounds of probability) to mine, but much more corpulent than
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As regards the bibliography of the
T&#363;zuk-i-Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299;, I have to note that there is an
Urdu translation by <span class="corr" id="xd24e312" title=
"Source: Munshi">Munsh&#299;</span> Ah&#803;mad &#703;Al&#299;
S&#299;m&#257;b of R&#257;mp&#363;ra, that is, Aligarh in Tonk. It was
made from Muh&#803;ammad H&#257;d&#299;&rsquo;s edition under the
patronage of Muh&#803;ammad Ibr&#257;h&#299;m &#703;Al&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n Naw&#257;b of Tonk, and was published by Newal Kishor
in 1291 (1874). There is also a Hindi translation by Munsh&#299;
Deb&#299; Pras&#257;d which was published in 1905 at Calcutta by the
Bh&#257;rat Mitra Press. The Urdu translation referred to by Mr.
Blumhardt in his Catalogue of Hindustani MSS., p. 61, and noticed by
Elliot, vi, 401, and Garcin de Tassy, iii, 301, is, as the two latter
writers have remarked, a translation of the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma. The
MS. referred to by Elliot vi, 277, as having been in the possession of
General Thomas Paterson Smith, and which is described in
Eth&eacute;&rsquo;s Catalogue of the India Office MSS., No. 2833, p.
1533, was made by Sayyid Muh&#803;ammad, the elder brother of Sayyid
Ah&#803;mad. <span class="corr" id="xd24e315" title=
"Source: As">At</span> the end of the MS. the copyist gives some
account of himself and of his family. He made the copy from copies in
the Royal Library and in the possession of Rajah Rogh&#363; N&#257;th
Singh <i>alias</i> L&#257;l Singh J&#257;lp&#363;r. He finished it in
October, 1843. Sayyid Muh&#803;ammad was Munsif of Hutg&#257;m in the
Fath&#803;p&#363;r district. He died young in 1845. My friend Mr. T. W.
Arnold, of the India Office, informs me that Sayyid Ah&#803;mad told
him that he found a valuable illustrated MS of the T&#363;zuk in the
d&eacute;bris of the Delhi Royal Library, and took it home, but that it
was lost when his house was plundered <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e321" href="#xd24e321" name="xd24e321">xv</a>]</span>by the
mutineers. There is in the Bodleian a copy in Sayyid
Ah&#803;mad&rsquo;s own handwriting. He states that he made use of ten
good MSS. The Englishman at whose request he made the copy was John
Panton Gubbins, who was once Sessions Judge of Delhi. This copy is
described in the Bodleian Catalogue, p. 117, No. 221. The MS. No. 220
described on the same page was brought home by Fraser, and is a good
one, but only goes down to the end of the 14th year.</p>

<p class="par"><span class="sc">Postscript.</span>&mdash;Since writing
this Preface I have been enabled by the kindness of Mr. Irvine to
examine the Hindi Jah&#257;ng&#299;r-n&#257;ma of Deb&#299;
Pras&#257;d. It is not a translation, but an abstract, and I do not
think it is of much value. Being a Jodhp&#363;r man he has been able,
perhaps, to correct some spellings of places, but he does not seem to
have consulted any MSS., and when he comes to a difficulty he shirks
it. The most valuable adjunct to the T&#363;zuk, after the
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, is the
Ma&#702;&#257;s&#804;ir-i-Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; of K&#257;mg&#257;r
H&#803;usain&#299;. It is important as giving the early history of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, that is, of the time when he was Prince Sel&#299;m.
There are three copies of his work in the British Museum, but the
so-called Ma&#257;thir-i-Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; of the India Office
Library, No. 3098, or 324 of the new Catalogue, is only a copy of the
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma.</p>
<p class="par">I regret that the number of Errata and Addenda is so
large, but when I began the revision I did not know that Sayyid
Ah&#803;mad&rsquo;s text was so incorrect. It will be seen that at pp.
158 and 162 I have made two erroneous notes.</p>

<p class="par first">By the boundless favour of Allah, when one
sidereal hour of Thursday,
Jum&#257;d&#257;-s&#804;-s&#804;&#257;n&#299; 20th, <span class=
"sc">A.H.</span> 1014 (October 24th, 1605), had passed, I ascended the
royal throne in the capital of Agra, in the 38th year of my
age.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e820src" href="#xd24e820" name=

<p class="par">Till he was 28 years old, no child of my father had
lived, and he was continually praying for the survival of a son to
dervishes and recluses, by whom spiritual approach to the throne of
Allah is obtained. As the great master, K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n Chis&#863;ht&#299;, was the fountain-head
of most of the saints of India, he considered that in order to obtain
this object he should have recourse to his blessed threshold, and
resolved within himself that if Almighty God should bestow a son on him
he would, by way of complete humility, go on foot from Agra to his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>blessed mausoleum, a distance of 140 <i>kos</i>. In
<span class="sc">A.H.</span> 977, on Wednesday, 17th
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal (August 31st, 1569), when seven
<i>g&#863;har&#299;</i> of the aforesaid day had passed, when Libra
(M&#299;z&#257;n) had risen to the 24th degree, God Almighty brought me
into existence from the hiding-place of nothingness. At the time when
my venerated father was on the outlook for a son, a dervish of the name
of S&#863;haik&#863;h Sal&#299;m, a man of ecstatic condition, who had
traversed many of the stages of life, had his abode on a hill near
S&#299;kr&#299;, one of the villages of Agra, and the people of that
neighbourhood had complete trust in him. As my father was very
submissive to dervishes, he also visited him. One day, when waiting on
him and in a state of distraction, he asked him how many sons he should
have. The S&#863;haik&#863;h replied, &ldquo;The Giver who gives
without being asked will bestow three sons on you.&rdquo; My father
said, &ldquo;I have made a vow that, casting my first son on the skirt
of your favour, I will make your friendship and kindness his protector
and preserver.&rdquo; The S&#863;haik&#863;h accepted this idea, and
said, &ldquo;I congratulate you, and I will give him my own
name.&rdquo; When my mother came near the time of her delivery, he
(Akbar) sent her to the S&#863;haik&#863;h&rsquo;s house that I might
be born there. After my birth they gave me the name of Sultan
Sal&#299;m, but I never heard my father, whether in his cups or in his
sober moments, call me Muh&#803;ammad Sal&#299;m or Sultan Sal&#299;m,
but always <i>S&#863;haik&#863;h&#363; B&#257;b&#257;</i>. My revered
father, considering the village of S&#299;kr&#299;, which was the place
of my birth, lucky for him, made it his capital. In the course of
fourteen or fifteen years that hill, full of wild beasts, became a city
containing all kinds of gardens and buildings, and lofty, elegant
edifices and pleasant places, attractive to the heart. After the
conquest of Gujar&#257;t this village was named Fath&#803;p&#363;r.
When I became king it occurred to me to change my name, because this
resembled that of the Emperor of R&#363;m. An inspiration from the
hidden world brought it into my mind <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3"
href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>that, inasmuch as the business of
kings is the controlling of the world, I should give myself the name of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r (World-seizer) and make my title of honour
(<i>laqab</i>) N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n, inasmuch as my sitting on the
throne coincided with the rising and shining on the earth of the great
light (the Sun). I had also heard, in the days when I was a prince,
from Indian sages, that after the expiration of the reign and life of
King Jal&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n Akbar one named N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n would
be administrator of the affairs of the State. Therefore I gave myself
the name and appellation of N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h. As this great event took place in Agra, it is
necessary that some account of that city should be given.</p>
<p class="par">Agra is one of the grand old cities of Hindustan. It had
formerly an old fort on the bank of the Jumna, but this my father threw
down before my birth, and he founded a fort of cut red stone, the like
of which those who have travelled over the world cannot point out. It
was completed in the space of fifteen or sixteen years. It had four
gates and two sally-ports, and its cost was 35 lakhs of rupees, equal
to 115,000 <i>tom&#257;n</i> of current Persian coinage and to
10,500,000 <i>k&#863;h&#257;n&#299;</i> according to the
T&#363;r&#257;n reckoning. The habitable part of the city extends on
both sides of the river. On its west side, which has the greater
population, its circumference is seven kos and its breadth is one kos.
The circumference of the inhabited part on the other side of the water,
the side towards the east, is 2&frac12; kos, its length being one kos
and its breadth half a kos. But in the number of its buildings it is
equal to several cities of &#703;Ir&#257;q, K&#863;hur&#257;s&#257;n,
and M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr (Transoxiana) put together. Many
persons have erected buildings of three or four storeys in it. The mass
of people is so great, that moving about in the lanes and bazars is
difficult. It is on the boundary of the second climate. On its east is
the province of Qanauj; on the west, N&#257;gor; on the north, Sambhal;
and on the south, Chander&#299;.</p>
<p class="par">It is written in the books of the Hindus that the source
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>of the Jumna is in a hill of the name of
Kalind,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e863src" href="#xd24e863" name=
"xd24e863src">2</a> which men cannot reach because of the excessive
cold. The apparent source is a hill near the pargana of
K&#863;hiz&#803;r&#257;b&#257;d.</p>
<p class="par">The air of Agra is warm and dry; physicians say that it
depresses the spirits (<i>r&#363;h&#803;r&#257; ba tah&#803;l&#299;l
m&#299;barad</i>) and induces weakness. It is unsuited to most
temperaments, except to the phlegmatic and melancholy, which are safe
from its bad effects. For this reason animals of this constitution and
temperament, such as the elephant, the buffalo, and others, thrive in
its climate.</p>
<p class="par">Before the rule of the Lod&#299; Afghans, Agra was a
great and populous place, and had a castle described by
Mas&#703;&#363;d b. Sa&#703;d b. Salm&#257;n in the ode
(<i>qa&#7779;&#299;da</i>) which he wrote in praise of
Mah&#803;m&#363;d, son of Sultan Ibr&#257;h&#299;m, son of
Mas&#703;&#363;d, son of Sultan Mah&#803;m&#363;d of G&#863;hazn&#299;,
on the capture of the castle&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The fort of Agra appeared in the midst of the

<p class="line">Like a mountain, and its battlements like
peaks.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e881src" href="#xd24e881" name=

</div>
<p class="par first">When Sikandar Lod&#299; designed to take Gwalior
he came to Agra from Delhi, which was the capital of the Sultans of
India, and settled down there. From that date the population and
prosperity of Agra increased, and it became the capital of the Sultans
of Delhi. When God Almighty bestowed the rule of India on this
illustrious family, the late king, B&#257;bar, after the defeat of
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m, the son of Sikandar Lod&#299;, and his being killed,
and after his victory over R&#257;n&#257; S&#257;ng&#257;, who was the
chief of the Rajas of Hindustan, established on the east side of the
Jumna, on improved land, a garden (<i>ch&#257;rb&#257;g&#863;h</i>)
which few places equal in beauty. He gave it the name of
Gul-afs&#863;h&#257;n <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5"
name="pb5">5</a>]</span>(Flower-scatterer), and erected in it a small
building of cut red stone, and having completed a mosque on one side of
it he intended to make a lofty building, but time failed him and his
design was never carried into execution.</p>
<p class="par">In these Memoirs, whenever <i>&#7778;&#257;h&#803;ib
qir&#257;n&#299;</i> is written it refers to Am&#299;r T&#299;m&#363;r
G&#363;rg&#257;n; and whenever <i>Fird&#363;s-mak&#257;n&#299;</i> is

<i>Jannat-&#257;s&#863;hy&#257;n&#299;</i> is used, to
Hum&#257;y&#363;n P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h; and when
<i>&#703;Ars&#863;h-&#257;s&#863;hy&#257;n&#299;</i> is employed, to my

P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;.</p>
<p class="par">Melons, mangoes, and other fruits grow well in Agra and
its neighbourhood. Of all fruits I am very fond of mangoes. In the
reign of my father
(<i>&#703;Ars&#863;h-&#257;s&#863;hy&#257;n&#299;</i>) many fruits of
other countries, which till then were not to be had in India, were
obtained there. Several sorts of grapes, such as the
<i>&#7779;&#257;h&#803;ib&#299;</i> and the
<i>h&#803;abs&#863;h&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e928src" href=
"#xd24e928" name="xd24e928src">4</a> and the
<i>kis&#863;hmis&#863;h&#299;</i>, became common in several towns; for
instance, in the bazars of Lahore every kind and variety that may be
desired can be had in the grape season. Among fruits, one which they
call <i>anan&#257;s</i> (pineapple), which is grown in the Frank
ports,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e950src" href="#xd24e950" name=
"xd24e950src">5</a> is of excessive fragrance and fine flavour. Many
thousands are produced every year now in the Gul-afs&#863;h&#257;n
garden at Agra.</p>
<p class="par">From the excellencies of its sweet-scented flowers one
may prefer the fragrances of India to those of the flowers of the whole
world. It has many such that nothing in the whole world can be compared
to them. The first is the <i>champa</i> (<i>Michelia champaca</i>),
which is a flower of exceedingly sweet fragrance; it has the shape of
the saffron-flower, but is yellow inclining to white. The tree is very
symmetrical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>and large, full of branches and leaves, and is
shady. When in flower one tree will perfume a garden. Surpassing this
is the <i>keo&#7771;&#257;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e968src" href=
"#xd24e968" name="xd24e968src">6</a> flower (<i>Pandanus
odoratissimus</i>). Its shape and appearance are singular, and its
scent is so strong and penetrating that it does not yield to the odour
of musk. Another is the <i>r&#257;e bel</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e978src" href="#xd24e978" name="xd24e978src">7</a> which in scent
resembles white jessamine. Its flowers are double and treble (?).
Another is the <i>m&#363;lsar&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e998src" href="#xd24e998" name="xd24e998src">8</a> (<i>Mimusops
Elengi</i>). This tree, too, is very graceful and symmetrical, and is
shady. The scent of its flowers is very pleasant. Another is the
<i>ketak&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e1021src" href=
"#xd24e1021" name="xd24e1021src">9</a> (<i>Pandanus</i> ?), which is of
the nature of the <i>keo&#7771;&#257;</i>, but the latter is thorny,
whereas the <i>ketk&#299;</i> has no thorns. Moreover, the
<i>ketk&#299;</i> is yellowish, whereas the <i>keo&#7771;&#257;</i> is
white. From these two flowers and also from the
<i>chambel&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e1084src" href=
"#xd24e1084" name="xd24e1084src">10</a> (<i>Jasminum grandiflorum</i>),
which is the white jessamine of <i>wil&#257;yat</i> (Persia or
Afghanistan), they extract sweet-scented oils. There are other flowers
too numerous to mention. Of trees there are the cypress (<i>sarw</i>),
the pine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>(<i>san&#363;bar</i>), the <i>chanar</i>
(<i>Platanus orientalis</i>), the white poplar
(<i>saf&#299;d&#257;r</i>, <i>Populus alba</i>), and the <i>b&#299;d
m&#363;ll&#257;</i> (willow), which they had formerly never thought of
in Hindustan, but are now plentiful. The sandal-tree, which once was
peculiar to the islands (i.e., Java, Sumatra, etc.), also flourishes in
the gardens.</p>
<p class="par">The inhabitants of Agra exert themselves greatly in the
acquirement of crafts and the search after learning. Various professors
of every religion and creed have taken up their abode in the city.</p>
<p class="par">After my accession, the first order that I gave was for
the fastening up of the Chain of Justice, so that if those engaged in
the administration of justice should delay or practise hypocrisy in the
matter of those seeking justice, the oppressed might come to this chain
and shake it so that its noise might attract attention. Its fashion was
this: I ordered them to make a chain of pure gold,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e1121src" href="#xd24e1121" name="xd24e1121src">11</a> 30
<i>gaz</i> in length and containing 60 bells. Its weight was 4 Indian
maunds, equal to 42 &#703;Ir&#257;q&#299; maunds. One end of it they
made fast to the battlements of the Sh&#257;h Burj of the fort at Agra
and the other to a stone post fixed on the bank of the river. I also
gave twelve orders to be observed as rules of conduct
(<i>dast&#363;ru-l-&#703;amal</i>) in all my dominions&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">(1) Forbidding the levy of cesses under the names of
<i>tamgh&#257;</i> and <i>m&#299;r bah&#803;r&#299;</i> (river tolls),

when I left Allahabad to wait upon my honoured father I presented him
with a drum and the <i>t&#363;m&#257;n-tog&#863;h</i> (standard of

and given him the government of the province of Bihar. I gave him
complete control over the province, and sent him off there. On the 4th
of Rajab, being fifteen days after my accession, he waited upon me. I
was exceedingly pleased at his coming, for his connection with me is
such that I look upon him as a brother, a son, a friend, and a
companion. As I had perfect confidence in his friendship, intelligence,
learning, and acquaintance with affairs, having made him Grand Vizier,
I promoted him to the rank of 5,000 with 5,000 horse and the lofty
title of <i>Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257;</i>, to which no title of my
servants is superior. Though his position might have warranted a higher
rank, he himself represented to me that until some notable service on
his part had become perceptible to me he would not accept a higher
grade than that mentioned (5,000).</p>
<p class="par">As the reality of the loyalty of my father&rsquo;s
servants had not yet become apparent, and certain faults and errors and
unbecoming intentions which were not approved at the throne of the
Creator or pleasing to His creatures had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

themselves became ashamed. Though on the day of my accession I had
forgiven all offences and determined with myself that I would exact no
retribution for past deeds, yet on account of the suspicion that had
been aroused in my mind about them I considered the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; my guardian and protector; although God
Almighty is the guardian of all His servants, and is especially so of
kings, because their existence is the cause of the contentment of the
world. His father, &#703;Abdu-&#7779;-&#7778;amad, who in the art of
painting had no equal in the age, had obtained from the late king
(<i>Jannat-&#257;s&#863;hy&#257;n&#299;</i>) Hum&#257;y&#363;n the
title of <i>S&#863;h&#299;r&#299;n-qalam</i> (Sweet pen), and in his
council had attained a great dignity and was on intimate terms with him
(the king). He was one of the chief men of S&#863;h&#299;r&#257;z. My
honoured father, on account of his former services, paid him great
honour and reverence. I made Raja M&#257;n Singh&mdash;who was one of
the greatest and most trusted noblemen of my father, and had obtained
alliances with this illustrious family, inasmuch as his aunt had been
in my father&rsquo;s house (i.e. was his wife),<a class="noteref" id=

Sult&#804;&#257;nu-n-nis&#257; Begam, the latter of whom is my eldest

Bengal. Though as in consequence of certain of his acts he had no
expectation of this favour towards himself, I dignified him with a
<i>ch&#257;rqab</i> (vest without sleeves) as a robe of honour, a
jewelled sword, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16"

province, which is a place of (or can keep up) 50,000 horse. His father
was Raja Bhagw&#257;n D&#257;s. His grandfather, Raja Bih&#257;r&#299;
Mal, was the first of the Kachw&#257;ha R&#257;jp&#363;ts to have the
honour of entering my father&rsquo;s service, and he excelled his tribe
in truth and sincerity of friendship, and in the quality of valour.
After my accession, when all the nobles with their retinues presented
themselves at my palace, it came into my mind that I should send this
body of retainers under my son, Sultan Parw&#299;z, to make a holy war
against the R&#257;n&#257;, who was one of evil deeds, and a foul
infidel of the country of Hindustan, and in my father&rsquo;s time had
had troops sent constantly against him, but had not been driven off. In
a fortunate hour I invested my said son with gorgeous robes of honour,
a jewelled waist-sword, a jewelled waist-dagger, and a rosary of pearls
intermixed with rubies of great price of the value of 72,000 rupees,
&#703;Ir&#257;q and Turkm&#257;n horses and famous elephants, and
dismissed him. About 20,000 horsemen with nobles and chief leaders were
appointed to this service. The first was &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n, who in my father&rsquo;s time was one of his
confidential servants, and for a long time had been confirmed in the
post of bakhshi and afterwards became <i>d&#299;w&#257;n ba
istiql&#257;l</i> (Chancellor with full powers); him I advanced from
the rank of an Am&#299;r to that of Vizier, and promoting him from the
command of 2,500 horse to that of 5,000 made him guardian to
Parw&#299;z. Having honoured him with a robe of honour, jewelled
waist-sword, a horse and an elephant, I ordered that all the
<i>man&#7779;abd&#257;rs</i> (commanders), small and great, should not
depart from such orders as he thought proper to give them. I made
&#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299; his bakhshi and

&#7778;adr Jah&#257;n has acted towards me with single-minded loyalty,
and I regard him as my preceptor in religions matters
(<i>k&#863;hal&#299;fa</i>). Whilst I was prince and before my revered
father&rsquo;s illness, and during that time, when the ministers
(pillars of the State) and the high nobles had become agitated, and
each had conceived some idea of gain for himself and wished to become
the originator of some act which could only bring ruin on the State, he
had not failed in the activity of his service and devotedness. Having

half-vizier of my dominions in the place of Waz&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n,
I gave him the high title of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula with the rank
of 1,500, and I appointed Waz&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n to the
<i>D&#299;w&#257;n&#299;</i> of the province of Bengal, and assigned to
him the settlement of the revenues thereof. To Patr D&#257;s, who in
the time of my father had the title of R&#257;y R&#257;y&#257;n, I gave
the title of Raja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t. The latter was one of the great
Rajas of India, and it was in his reign that astronomical observatories
were established in India. I made Patr D&#257;s Master of Ordnance, and
ordered that he should always have light artillery<a class="noteref"

gun-carriages, ready and in efficient order. He was a
<i>khatr&#299;</i> by caste, and rose in my father&rsquo;s service from
being accountant of the elephants&rsquo; stables to be diwan and an
amir. He is not wanting in military qualities and in administrative
skill. I made K&#863;hurram, the son of K&#863;h&#257;n
A&#703;z&#804;am (&#703;Az&#299;z Koka), who had had the rank of 2,000,

<p class="par">As it was my desire that many of the Akbar&#299; and
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; officers should obtain the fruition of their

effect, so that in accordance with the Ching&#299;z canon
(<i>t&#363;ra</i>) the estate might be conveyed to him by <i>&#257;l

adorned the farmans for these with the <i>&#257;l tamg&#863;h&#257;</i>

I count him as a son, and have promoted him to the rank of 1,000. I

has served me personally from his childhood, and who, when I was
prince, rose from the grade of an ahadi to that of 500, giving him the
title of Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n and the rank of 1,500. He was
confirmed as bakhshi of my private establishment
(<i>s&#863;h&#257;gird-p&#299;s&#863;ha</i>).</p>
<p class="par">I promoted Raja B&#299;r Singh Deo, a Bandela Rajput,
who had obtained my favour, and who excels his equals and relatives in
valour, personal goodness, and simple-heartedness, to the rank of
3,000. The reason for his advancement and for the regard shown to him
was that near the end of my revered father&rsquo;s time,
S&#863;haik&#863;h Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l, who excelled the
S&#863;haik&#863;hz&#257;das of Hindustan in wisdom and learning, had
adorned himself outwardly with the jewel of sincerity, and sold it to
my father at a heavy price. He had been summoned from the Deccan, and,
since his feelings towards me were not honest, he both publicly and
privately spoke against me. At this period when, through
strife-exciting intriguers, the august feelings of my royal father were
entirely embittered against me, it was certain that if he obtained the
honour of waiting on him (Akbar) it would be the cause of more
confusion, and would preclude me <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25"
href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>from the favour of union with
him (my father). It became necessary to prevent him from coming to
Court. As B&#299;r Singh Deo&rsquo;s country was exactly on his route
and he was then a rebel, I sent him a message that if he would stop
that sedition-monger and kill him he would receive every kindness from
me. By God&rsquo;s grace, when S&#863;haik&#863;h Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l
was passing through B&#299;r Singh Deo&rsquo;s country, the Raja
blocked his road, and after a little contest scattered his men and
killed him. He sent his head to me in Allahabad. Although this event
was a cause of anger in the mind of the late king (Akbar), in the end
it enabled me to proceed without disturbance of mind to kiss the
threshold of my father&rsquo;s palace, and by degrees the resentment of
the king was cleared away.</p>
<p class="par">I made M&#299;r Z&#803;iy&#257;&#702;u-d-d&#299;n of
Qazw&#299;n, who had done me service in the days of my princehood and
had shown loyalty, commander of 1,000 and accountant of the stables. An
order was given that every day thirty horses should be produced before
me for the purpose of making presents. I honoured M&#299;rz&#257;
&#703;Al&#299; Akbars&#863;h&#257;h&#299;, who is one of the
distinguished braves of this family,<a class="noteref" id=

rank of 4,000, and gave him the sarkar of Sambhal as his jagir.</p>
<p class="par">One day the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; (S&#863;har&#299;f
K&#863;h&#257;n) greatly pleased me by an incidental remark. It was
this: &ldquo;Honesty and dishonesty are not confined to matters of cash
and goods; to represent qualities as existing in acquaintances which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>do not exist, and to conceal the meritorious
qualities of strangers, is dishonesty. In truth, honesty of speech
consists in making no distinction between intimates and strangers and
in describing each man as he really is.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When I sent off Parw&#299;z I had said to him, &ldquo;If
the R&#257;n&#257; himself, and his eldest son who is called Karan,
should come to wait upon you and proffer service and obedience, you
should not do any injury to his territory.&rdquo; My intention in this
recommendation was of two kinds; one, that inasmuch as the conquest of
Transoxiana was always in the pure mind of my revered father, though
every time he determined on it things occurred to prevent it, if this
business could be settled, and this danger dismissed from my mind, I
would leave Parw&#299;z in Hindustan, and in reliance on Allah, myself
start for my hereditary territories, especially as at this time there
was no permanent ruler in that region. B&#257;q&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n,
who, after &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n and
&#703;Abdu-l-Mu&#702;m&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n, his son, had acquired
complete independence, had died, and the affairs of Wal&#299;
Muh&#803;ammad K&#863;h&#257;n, his brother, who is now the ruler of
that region, had not as yet been brought into proper order. Secondly,
to bring about the termination of the war in the Deccan, of which a
part in the time of my revered father had been acquired, so that it
might come into possession, and be incorporated with the Imperial
dominions. My hope is that through the favour of Allah both these
undertakings will be accomplished.</p>

several matters with him, and from this familiarity he called him

of history and in biographies. There is in this day no chronologist
like him in the inhabited world. From the beginning of Creation till

<p class="par">On Sha&#703;b&#257;n 27th (28th December, 1605) a
strange thing was done by the sons of Akhayr&#257;j, son of
Bhagw&#257;n D&#257;s, the paternal uncle<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1950src" href="#xd24e1950" name="xd24e1950src">66</a> of Raja
M&#257;n Singh. These unlucky ones, who bore the names of Abhay
R&#257;m, Bijay R&#257;m, and Shy&#257;m R&#257;m, were exceedingly
immoderate. Notwithstanding that the aforesaid Abhay R&#257;m had done
improper (disproportioned) acts, I had winked at his faults. When at
this date it was represented to me that this wretch was desirous of
despatching his wives and children without leave to his own country and
afterwards of himself running away to the R&#257;n&#257;, who is not
loyal to this family, I referred to R&#257;m D&#257;s and other Rajput
nobles, and said to them that if any one of them would become security
for them, I would confirm the rank and jagir of those wretches, and
passing over their offences would forgive them. In consequence of their
excessive turbulence and bad disposition no one became security. I told
the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; that as no one would be bound for them,
they must be handed over to the charge of one of the servants of the
Court until security was forthcoming. The Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; gave
them over to Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n K&#257;kar, who was
afterwards dignified with the title of Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n,

they refused, and, not observing the dues of good manners, began,
together with their servants, to quarrel and fight. The

them to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=

himself to driving them off, and I sent S&#863;haik&#863;h Far&#299;d
also after him. One Rajput armed with a sword, and another with a
dagger stood up to the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257;. One of his attendants
named Qut&#804;b engaged the man with the dagger and was killed. The
Rajput also was cut to pieces. One of the Afghan attendants of the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; attacked the one who had the sword and killed
him. Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n drew his dagger and turned towards
Abhay R&#257;m, who with two others was holding his ground, and after
wounding one of these fell down after receiving wounds from the three.
Some of the ahadis and the men of the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; opposed
and slew these doomed men. A Rajput drew his sword and turned to
S&#863;haik&#863;h Far&#299;d; he was met by a H&#803;abs&#863;h&#299;
slave, who brought him down. This disturbance took place in the
courtyard of the public palace. That punishment served as a warning to
many who had not looked to consequences. Ab&#363;-n-nab&#299;<a class=

the wise men of the Hindus, &ldquo;If the doctrines of your religion

different forms by the process of metempsychosis, they are virtually
rejected by the intelligent. This pernicious idea requires that the
Sublime Cause, who is void of all limitations, should be possessed of
length, breadth, and thickness. If the purpose is the manifestation of
the Light of God in these bodies, that of itself is existent equally in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=

ten forms. If the idea is to establish some one of God&rsquo;s

Him.&rdquo; Then said I, &ldquo;How can these forms be a means of your
approaching the Deity?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">My father always associated with the learned of every
creed and religion, especially with Pandits and the learned of India,
and although he was illiterate, so much became clear to him through
constant intercourse with the learned and wise, in his conversations
with them, that no one knew him to be illiterate, and he was so
acquainted with the niceties of verse and prose compositions that his
deficiency was not thought of.</p>
<p class="par">In his august personal appearance he was of middle
height, but inclining to be tall; he was of the hue of wheat; his eyes

was lion-bodied,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2021src" href="#xd24e2021"

<p class="par first">Three months after my birth my sister,
S&#863;h&#257;hz&#257;da K&#863;h&#257;nam, was born to one of the
royal concubines; they gave her over to his (Akbar&rsquo;s) mother,
Maryam Mak&#257;n&#299;. After her a son was born to one of the
concubines, and received the name of S&#863;h&#257;h Mur&#257;d. As his
birth occurred in the hill country of Fath&#803;p&#363;r, he was
nicknamed <i>Pah&#257;r&#299;</i>. When my revered father sent him to
conquer the Deccan, he had taken to excessive drinking through
associating with unworthy persons, so that he died in his 30th year, in
the neighbourhood of J&#257;ln&#257;p&#363;r, in the province of Berar.
His personal appearance was fresh-coloured; he was thin in body and
tall of stature. Dignity and authority were evident in his movements,
and manliness and bravery manifested themselves in his ways. On the
night of Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal 10th, <span class="sc">A.H.</span>
979 (September, 1572), another son was born to one of the concubines.
As his birth took place at Ajm&#299;r in the house of one of the
attendants of the blessed shrine of the reverend K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n Chis&#863;ht&#299;, whose name was
S&#863;haik&#863;h D&#257;niy&#257;l, this child was called

<p class="par">After the death of my brother S&#863;h&#257;h
Mur&#257;d, he (Akbar), towards the end of his reign, sent
D&#257;niy&#257;l to conquer the Deccan and followed him himself. When
my revered father was besieging &#256;s&#299;r (&#256;s&#299;rgarh) he,
with a large body of nobles such as the
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n and his sons and M&#299;rz&#257;
Y&#363;suf K&#863;h&#257;n, invested the fort of Ahmadnagar, and it
came <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=

about the time that &#256;s&#299;r was taken. After my father
&#703;Ars&#863;h-&#257;s&#863;hy&#257;n&#299; had returned in
prosperity and victory from Burhanpur towards his capital, he gave the
province to D&#257;niy&#257;l and left him in possession of that
territory. D&#257;niy&#257;l took to improper ways, like his brother
S&#863;h&#257;h Mur&#257;d, and soon died from excessive drinking, in
the 33rd year of his age. His death occurred in a peculiar way. He was
very fond of guns and of hunting with the gun. He named one of his guns
<i>yaka u jan&#257;za</i>, &lsquo;the same as the bier,&rsquo; and
himself composed this couplet and had it engraved on the
gun:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;From the joy of the chase with thee, life is

<p class="par first">When his drinking of wine was carried to excess,
and the circumstance was reported to my father, farmans of reproach
were sent to the K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n. Of course he
forbade it, and placed cautious people to look after him properly. When
the road to bring wine was completely closed, he began to weep and to
importune some of his servants, and said: &ldquo;Let them bring me wine
in any possible way.&rdquo; He said to Murs&#863;hid Qul&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n, a musketeer who was in his immediate service:
&ldquo;Pour some wine into this <i>yaka u jan&#257;za</i>, and bring it
to me.&rdquo; That wretch, in hope of favour, undertook to do this, and
poured double-distilled spirit into the gun, which had long been
nourished on gunpowder and the scent thereof, and brought it. The rust
of the iron was dissolved by the strength of the spirit and mingled
with it, and the prince no sooner drank of it than he fell down.</p>

and would occasionally compose verses with correct idiom in the
language of the people of India, which were not bad.</p>
<p class="par">After the birth of D&#257;niy&#257;l a daughter was born

the skirt of my revered father&rsquo;s care, she turned out very well.
She is of good disposition and naturally compassionate towards all
people. From infancy and childhood she has been extremely fond of me,
and there can be few such relationships between brother and sister. The
first time when, according to the custom of pressing the breast of a
child and a drop of milk is perceptible, they pressed my sister&rsquo;s
breast and milk appeared, my revered father said to me:
&ldquo;B&#257;b&#257;! drink this milk, that in truth this sister may

from that day forward, after I drank that drop of milk, I have felt
love for my sister such as children have for their mothers.</p>
<p class="par">After some time another girl was born to this same

disposition was on the whole inclined to excitement and heat. My father
was very fond of her, so much so that he described her impolitenesses
as politenesses, and in his august sight they, from his great love, did
not appear bad. Repeatedly he honoured me by addressing me, and said:
&ldquo;B&#257;b&#257;! for my sake be as kind as I am, after me, to

limit of approval and the bounds of praise. If books were composed with
regard to his commendable dispositions, without suspicion of
extravagance, and he be not looked at as a father would be by his son,
even then but a little out of much could be said.</p>
<p class="par">Notwithstanding his kingship and his treasures and his
buried wealth, which were beyond the scope of counting and imagination,
his fighting elephants and Arab horses, he never by a hair&rsquo;s

persuasion, and was gracious to all in accordance with their condition
and understanding. He passed his nights in wakefulness, and slept
little in the day; the length of his sleep during a whole night and day
(<i>nycthemeron</i>) was not more than a watch and a half. He counted
his wakefulness at night as so much added to his life. His courage and
boldness were such that he could mount raging, rutting elephants, and
subdue to obedience murderous elephants which would not allow their own
females near them&mdash;although even when an elephant is bad-tempered
he does no harm to the female or his driver&mdash;and which were in a
state in which they might have killed their drivers or the females, or
not have allowed their approach. He would place himself on a wall or
tree near which an elephant was passing that had killed its mahout and
broken loose from restraint, and, putting his trust in God&rsquo;s
favour, would throw himself on its back and thus by merely mounting,
would bring it under control and tame it. This was repeatedly seen.</p>

Tard&#299; Beg K&#863;h&#257;n and a large force that was in the city
drew up to oppose him. When the preparations for the combat had been
made the armies attacked one another, and, after considerable
endeavours and strife, defeat fell on Tard&#299; Beg K&#863;h&#257;n
and the Moguls, and the army of darkness overcame the army of
light.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;All things and battles and fights are of
God,</p>
<p class="line">He knows whose will be the victory.</p>
<p class="line">From the blood of the brave and the dust of the

<p class="line">The earth grew red and the heavens black.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Tard&#299; Beg K&#863;h&#257;n and the other
defeated ones took the road to my revered father&rsquo;s camp. As
Bair&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n disliked Tard&#299; Beg, he made this
defeat an excuse to put him to death.</p>
<p class="par">A second time, through the pride engendered in the mind
of this accursed infidel by his victory, he came out of Delhi with his
force and elephants and advanced, while the glorious standards of His
Majesty (Akbar) proceeded from Kal&#257;n&#363;r for the purpose of
driving him away. The armies of darkness and light met in the
neighbourhood of Panipat, and on Thursday, Muh&#803;arram 2nd, A.H. 964
(November 5th, 1556), a fight took place. In the army of Hem&#363; were
30,000 brave fighting horsemen, while the <i>g&#863;h&#257;z&#299;s</i>
of the victorious army were not more than 4,000 or 5,000. On that day
Hem&#363; was riding an elephant named Haw&#257;&#702;&#299;. Suddenly
an arrow struck the eye of that infidel and came out at the back of his
head. His army, on seeing this, took to flight. By chance
S&#863;h&#257;h Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n Mah&#803;ram with a few brave
men came up to the elephant on which was the wounded Hem&#363;, and
would have shot an arrow at the driver, but he cried &ldquo;Do not kill
me; Hem&#363; is on this elephant.&rdquo; A number of men immediately
conveyed Hem&#363; as he was to the king (Akbar). Bair&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n represented <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href=
"#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>that it would be proper if the king
with his own hand should strike the infidel with a sword, so that
obtaining the reward of a g&#863;h&#257;z&#299; (warrior of the Faith)
he might use this title on the imperial farmans. The king answered,
&ldquo;I have cut him in pieces before this,&rdquo; and explained:
&ldquo;One day, in Kabul, I was copying a picture in presence of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja&#703;Abdu-&#7779;-&#7778;amad S&#863;h&#299;r&#299;n
Qalam, when a form appeared from my brush, the parts of which were
separate and divided from each other. One of those near asked,
&lsquo;Whose picture is this?&rsquo; It came to my tongue to say that
it was the likeness of Hem&#363;.&rdquo; Not defiling his hand with his
(Hem&#363;&rsquo;s) blood, he told one of his servants to cut off his
head. Those killed in the defeated army numbered 5,000 in addition to
those who fell in various places round about.</p>
<p class="par">Another of the well-known deeds of Akbar was the
victorious expedition against Gujarat, and his rapid march there, at
the time when M&#299;rz&#257; Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain,
Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain M&#299;rz&#257;, and S&#863;h&#257;h
M&#299;rz&#257; revolted from this State and went towards Gujarat, and
all the nobles of that province, combining with the turbulent of those
parts, besieged the fort of Ahmadabad in which was M&#299;rz&#257;
&#703;Az&#299;z Koka with the royal army. His Majesty, in consequence
of the distracted state of J&#299;j&#299; Ang&#257;, the mother of the
last-named M&#299;rz&#257;, started for Gujarat with a body of royal
troops without delay from the capital of Fath&#803;p&#363;r. Having
covered in the space of nine days the long road which it should take
two months to accomplish, sometimes on horseback, sometimes on a camel
or in a bullock-cart, he arrived at Sarn&#257;l.</p>
<p class="par">When, on 5th Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal, 980 (September
15th, 1572), he reached the neighbourhood of the enemy&rsquo;s camp, he
consulted with those who were loyal to him. Some said he should make a
night attack on the camp. His Majesty, however, said that a night
attack was the resort of the faint-hearted and the way of the
deceitful, and immediately gave orders to beat the drums and set the
horsemen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>at them. When the river S&#257;bar Mah&#299;
(S&#257;barmat&#299;) was reached, he ordered his men to cross it in
order. Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain M&#299;rz&#257; was agitated by the
noise of the army of victory, and himself came forward to reconnoitre.
Subh&#803;&#257;n Qul&#299; Turk, also with a troop of brave men, went
to the river&rsquo;s bank to enquire into the enemy&rsquo;s position.
The M&#299;rz&#257; asked what troops these were. Subh&#803;&#257;n
Qul&#299; replied that they were of the army of King
Jal&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n Akbar. That ill-fated one would not believe
this, and said his spies had seen the king fourteen days before in
Fath&#803;p&#363;r, and that it was clear Subh&#803;&#257;n Qul&#299;
was lying. To this Subh&#803;&#257;n Qul&#299; rejoined, &ldquo;Nine
days ago the king with this expedition started from
Fath&#803;p&#363;r.&rdquo; &ldquo;How could elephants have
come?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2171src" href="#xd24e2171"
name="xd24e2171src">88</a> asked the M&#299;rz&#257;. &ldquo;What need
was there of elephants?&rdquo; answered Subh&#803;&#257;n Qul&#299;.
&ldquo;Young men and heroes who cleave rocks, and are better than
famous and raging elephants, have come; the difference between loyalty
and sedition will now become known.&rdquo; The M&#299;rz&#257;, after
this conversation, turned aside and began to marshal his troops. The
king waited until his advanced guard sent word that the enemy had put
on their armour. He then moved forward, and although he sent several
times to order the K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am to advance, the
latter stood still. It was said to Akbar that, as the enemy was in
force, it would be well to remain on his side of the river until the
army of Gujarat arrived from within the fort. His Majesty answered:
&ldquo;Always, and especially in this affair, I have put my trust in
God. If I had considered routine, I should not have come in this rapid
manner. Now that our foe is ready for the fight, we ought not to
delay.&rdquo; With these words, and with his innate reliance on God as
his shield, he put his horse into the river with a few chosen men whom
he had appointed to ride with him. Though it was not supposed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>that there was a ford, he crossed in safety. He
had called for his helmet, but in the agitation of bringing it his
armour-bearer dropped the face-guard (<i>buffe</i>). His comrades did
not regard this as a good omen, but he said at once, &ldquo;It is an
excellent omen, for it has revealed my face.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e2179src" href="#xd24e2179" name="xd24e2179src">89</a> Meantime
the wretched M&#299;rz&#257; arrayed his ranks to fight his

<p class="par first">The K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am had had no
idea that the king would cast the shadow of his compassion on these
regions with such speed and eagerness, and he believed no one who gave
him news of that arrival, until convinced by visible proof. Then,
arraying the army of Gujarat, he prepared to march. Meanwhile
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n also sent news to him. Before his army
issued from the fort the enemy had appeared from amongst the trees. The
king, taking the Divine aid as the security of his courage, started
off. Muh&#803;ammad Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n Turk and Tard&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n D&#299;w&#257;na came forward with a band of brave
followers, and after a little fighting turned rein. On this His Majesty
said to Bhagw&#257;n D&#257;s, &ldquo;The enemy are unnumbered and we
are few; we must attack with one face and one heart; for a clenched
fist is more useful than an open hand.&rdquo; With these words he drew
his sword, and with shout of <i>Allahu-akbar</i> and <i>Y&#257;
Mu&#703;&#299;n</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e2197src" href=

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The sense of the age evaporated with the

<p class="line">The ear of the heavens was split with the

</div>
<p class="par first">The royal right and left wings and a band of brave
men in the centre fought with valour. Stars
(<i>kaukab&#257;&#702;&#299;</i>), which are a kind of firework, were
lighted by the enemy; they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href=
"#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>twisted about among the thorn-bushes,
and created such confusion that a noted elephant of the enemy began to
move and threw their troops into disarray. With this the royal centre
came up and dispersed Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain and his force.
M&#257;n Singh Darb&#257;r&#299; overcame his foe under the
king&rsquo;s eyes, and R&#257;gho D&#257;s Kachhw&#257;ha sacrificed
his life. Muh&#803;ammad Waf&#257;, who was of the house-born of the
State, behaving very bravely, fell wounded from his horse. By the
favour of the Creator who cherishes His servants, and simply through
the courage and good fortune of the exalted king, the enemy were
scattered and defeated. In gratitude for this great victory the king
turned his face in supplication to the throne of his merciful Maker,
and poured forth his thanks.</p>
<p class="par">One of the kal&#257;wants (musicians) represented to His
Majesty that Saif K&#863;h&#257;n Kokalt&#257;s&#863;h had offered the
coin of his life in loyalty to the State, and on enquiry it appeared
that when Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain M&#299;rz&#257; with some of his
riffraff was attacking the centre Saif K&#863;h&#257;n met him and
fighting valiantly became a martyr. The M&#299;rz&#257; himself was
wounded by the hands of the brave men of the main body. The
Kokalt&#257;s&#863;h mentioned is the elder brother of Zain
K&#863;h&#257;n Koka.</p>
<p class="par">A strange circumstance was this: on the day before the
battle, when the king was eating, he asked Haz&#257;ra, who was learned
in the science of looking at the shoulder-blades (a kind of
divination), to see on whose side the victory would be. Haz&#257;ra
said: &ldquo;The victory will be on your side, but one of the chiefs of
your army will become a martyr.&rdquo; Whereupon Saif K&#863;h&#257;n
Koka said &ldquo;Would that this blessing might fall to my
lot!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Many an omen that we have treated as

<p class="par">In short, M&#299;rz&#257; Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain
turned his reins, but his horse&rsquo;s feet became entangled in the
thorn-brake and he fell. An ahadi of the king, Gad&#257; &#703;Al&#299;
by name, found him, and having mounted him before him on his horse took
him to the king. As two or three claimed a share in his capture, His
Majesty asked who had made him prisoner. &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s
salt,&rdquo; he answered. The king ordered his hands, that had been
fastened behind him, to be tied in front. Meanwhile he asked for water.
Farh&#803;at K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of the confidential slaves,
struck him on the head, but the king, disapproving of this, sent for
his private drinking water and satisfied his thirst. Up to this time
M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Az&#299;z Koka and the garrison of the fort had
not come out. After the capture of the M&#299;rz&#257;, His Majesty was
proceeding slowly towards Ahmadabad. He had delivered the
M&#299;rz&#257; to R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh R&#257;&#7789;hor, one of
the Rajput chiefs, to be put on an elephant and brought with him.
Meanwhile Ik&#863;htiy&#257;ru-l-mulk, who was one of the influential
Gujarati leaders, made his appearance with an army of nearly 5,000 men.
Complete confusion fell upon the royal troops. The king, as his natural
valour and lofty disposition required, ordered the drums to be beaten,
and Shaj&#257;&#702;at K&#863;h&#257;n, R&#257;ja Bhagw&#257;n
D&#257;s, and some others charged on in front to fight this force.
Fearing that the enemy might get possession of M&#299;rz&#257;
Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain, R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh&rsquo;s men, by
the advice and plan of the aforesaid Raja (Bhagw&#257;n D&#257;s), cut
off his head. My father did not want to kill him. The forces of
Ik&#863;htiy&#257;ru-l-mulk also were dispersed, and he was thrown from
his horse into the thorn thicket. Suhr&#257;b Beg Turkm&#257;n cut off
his head and brought it in. It was only by the grace and power of God
that such a victory was won by a small number of men.</p>
<p class="par">In the same way are beyond all reckoning the conquest of
the province of Bengal, the capture of well-known and celebrated forts
in Hindustan such as Chitor and Ran&#7789;ambhor, the subjection of the
province of Khandesh, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href=
"#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>taking of the fort of &#256;s&#299;r
and of other provinces which by the exertions of the royal armies came
into the possession of the servants of the State. If these were related
in detail it would be a long story.</p>
<p class="par">In the fight at Chitor, the king with his own hand
killed Jitmal, the leader of the men in the fort. He had no rival in
shooting with a gun, and with the one with which he killed Jitmal, and
which was called Sangr&#257;m, he killed some 3,000 or 4,000 birds and
beasts.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2237src" href="#xd24e2237" name=

sports I am most disposed to that with the gun, and in one day have
shot eighteen deer.</p>
<p class="par">Of the austerities practised by my revered father, one
was the not eating the flesh of animals. During three months of the
year he ate meat, and for the remaining nine contented himself with
&#7778;&#363;f&#299; food, and was no way pleased with the slaughter of
animals. On many days and in many months this was forbidden to the
people. The days and months on which he did not eat flesh are detailed
in the Akbarn&#257;ma.</p>
<p class="par">On the day I made I&#703;tim&#257;du-l-mulk diwan, I put
Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk in charge of the
<i>d&#299;w&#257;n&#299;-i-buy&#363;t&#257;t</i> (care of buildings).

<p class="par">On one of my accession days, a hundred of the
Akbar&#299; and Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; servants were promoted to
higher rank and jagirs. At the commencement of the Ramaz&#803;&#257;n
&#703;&#298;d, as it was the first after my accession, I came down to
the &#703;&#298;dg&#257;h from my auspicious throne. There was a great
crowd, and having performed the dues of thanksgiving and praise
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=

verse &ldquo;From the table of kings favours come to beggars,&rdquo; I
commanded a sum of money to be spent in alms and charity. Some lakhs of
d&#257;ms of this were entrusted to D&#363;st Muh&#803;ammad
(afterwards K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n), who divided them amongst
faqirs and those who were in want, and a lakh of d&#257;ms each was
given to Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain Anj&#363; (the
lexicographer), M&#299;rz&#257; &#7778;adr Jah&#257;n, and M&#299;r
Muh&#803;ammad Riz&#803;&#257; Sabzaw&#257;r&#299; to dispose of in
charity in different quarters of the city. I sent 5,000 rupees to the
dervishes of S&#863;haik&#863;h Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain
J&#257;m&#299;, and gave directions that each day one of the officers
of the watch<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2263src" href="#xd24e2263"
name="xd24e2263src">95</a> should give 50,000 d&#257;ms to faqirs. I
sent a jewelled sword to the K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, and
promoted Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n Anj&#363; to the rank of 3,000. The
office of <i>&#7778;adr</i> was entrusted to M&#299;r&#257;n &#7778;adr
Jah&#257;n, and I ordered H&#803;&#257;j&#299; Koka, who was one of my
father&rsquo;s foster-sisters,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2272src"
href="#xd24e2272" name="xd24e2272src">96</a> to bring before me in the
palace such women as were worthy to be presented with land and money. I
promoted Z&#257;hid K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Muh&#803;ammad
&#7778;&#257;diq K&#863;h&#257;n, from the rank of 1,500 to that of
2,000.</p>
<p class="par">It had been the custom<a class="noteref" id=

the gift of an elephant or horse was made to anyone, the naqibs and the
Masters of the Horse (<i>M&#299;r &#256;k&#863;h&#363;r&#257;n</i>)
took from him a sum of money as <i>jilaw&#257;na</i> (bridle-money). I
gave orders that this money should be paid by the government, so that
people might be freed from the importunities and demands of that set of
men.</p>
<p class="par">At this time S&#257;lb&#257;han arrived from Burhanpur
and produced before me the horses and elephants of my deceased brother
D&#257;niy&#257;l. Of the elephants, one male named Mast <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>Alast
appeared to me the best, and I gave him the name of N&#363;r Gaj. A
wonderful thing showed itself in this elephant; on the sides of his
ears small lumps had grown about the size of melons, and from them came
fluid such as drops from an elephant in the rutting season; moreover,
the top of his forehead was more prominent than in other elephants. It
was a splendid and imposing animal.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2290src"

<p class="par">I gave to my son K&#863;hurram
(S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n) a rosary of jewels, with the hope that he
might obtain fulfilment of all his desires, both in visible and in
spiritual things.</p>
<p class="par">As I had remitted in my dominions customs duties
amounting to krors, I abolished also all the transit dues
(<i>s&#257;&#702;ir-jih&#257;t</i>) in Kabul, which is one of the noted
towns on the road to Hindustan. These brought in 1 kror and 23 lakhs of
dams. From the provinces of Kabul and Qandahar large sums used to be
derived every year from customs (<i>zak&#257;&#702;t</i>), which were
in fact the chief revenue of those places. I remitted these ancient
dues, a proceeding that greatly benefited the people of Iran and
Turan.</p>
<p class="par">&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s jagir in the
subah of Bih&#257;r had been given to B&#257;z Bah&#257;dur; I
therefore ordered that a jagir in the Panjab should be given to him. As
it was represented to me that a large sum was in arrears in his jagir,
and now that the order for exchange had been given its collection would
be difficult, I directed that a lakh of rupees should be given to him
from the Treasury and the arrears recovered from B&#257;z Bah&#257;dur
for the royal revenues.</p>
<p class="par">I promoted S&#863;har&#299;f &#256;mul&#299; to the rank
of 2,500, original and increase. He is a pure-hearted, lively-spirited
man. Though he has no tincture of current sciences, lofty words and
exalted knowledge often manifest themselves in him. In the dress of a
faqir he made many journeys, and he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48"

and recites the maxims of those who profess mysticism. This is his
conversation, not his practice (<i>q&#257;li-&#363; ast na

relinquished the garments of poverty and asceticism, and attained to
amirship and chiefship. His utterance is exceedingly powerful, and his

<p class="par first">In my father&rsquo;s time it had become
established that one of the great nobles should prepare an
entertainment on each of the 17 or 18 days of the festival, and should
present His Majesty the king with choice gifts of all kinds of jewels
and jewelled things, precious stuffs, and elephants and horses, and
should invite him to take the trouble to come to his assembly. By way
of exalting his servants, he would deign to be present, and having
looked at the presents would take what he approved of and bestow the
remainder on the giver of the entertainment. As my mind was inclined to
the comfort and ease of the army and subjects, I this year let them off
their gifts with the exception of a few from my immediate retainers,
which I accepted in order to gratify them. In those same days many
servants of the State obtained higher rank. Amongst them I raised
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n Afg&#863;h&#257;n to 1,500, and I raised
R&#257;ja B&#257;so, who was a landholder of the hill country of the
Panjab, and who from the time I was prince till now has kept the way of
service and sincerity towards me and held the rank of 1,500, to 3,500.
S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of Qandahar, I
promoted to 5,000, and R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh, a R&#257;jp&#363;t
noble, obtained the same rank. I gave 12,000 rupees for expenses to
R&#257;n&#257; S&#863;hankar.</p>
<p class="par">At the beginning of my reign, a son of that
Muz&#804;affar Gujar&#257;t&#299; who claimed to be descended from the
rulers of that country lifted up the head of disturbance and attacked
and plundered the environs of the city of Ahmadabad. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>Some
sardars such as P&#299;m<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2345src" href=
"#xd24e2345" name="xd24e2345src">102</a> Bah&#257;dur &#362;zbeg and
R&#257;y &#703;Al&#299; Bhat&#299;, who were amongst the distinguished
and brave men there, became martyrs in that outbreak. At length
R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t and many mansabdars were provided by me
with 6,000 or 7,000 horse, and appointed to assist the army of Gujarat.
It was decided that when things had quieted down, by the driving off of
those seditious people, R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t should be
Subahdar of Gujarat. Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been
previously nominated to this office, should come to Court. After the
arrival of the royal troops the thread of the rebels&rsquo; union was
severed; they took refuge in different jungles, and the country was
reduced to order. The news of this victory reached the ear of my state
and dignity in the most acceptable of hours (New Year time).</p>
<p class="par">About this time there came a representation from my son
Parw&#299;z that the R&#257;n&#257; had left <i>th&#257;na</i> Mandal,
which is about 30<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2356src" href="#xd24e2356"
name="xd24e2356src">103</a> or 40 <i>kos</i> from Ajm&#299;r, and had
run away, and that a force had been appointed to pursue him; and that
it was to be hoped the good fortune of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r would cause
him to become non-existent.</p>
<p class="par">On the last day of the feast of the New Year, many
servants of the State were honoured with favours and increase of rank.
P&#299;s&#863;hrau K&#863;h&#257;n was an old retainer and had come
from Persia (<i>wil&#257;yat</i>) with Hum&#257;y&#363;n; indeed, he
was one of the men whom S&#863;h&#257;h Tahm&#257;sp had sent with
Hum&#257;y&#363;n. His name was Mihtar Sa&#703;&#257;dat. As under my
father he was superintendent (<i>d&#257;rog&#863;ha</i>) and head
(<i>mihtar</i>) of the <i>farr&#257;s&#863;h-k&#863;h&#257;na</i>
(store department), and had no equal in this service, he had given him
the title of P&#299;s&#863;hrau K&#863;h&#257;n (the active
K&#863;h&#257;n). Though he was a subordinate(?) servant and had an
artificer&rsquo;s disposition (<i>qalaqch&#299; mas&#863;hrab</i>),
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=

"#xd24e2390" name="xd24e2390src">105</a> ideas had entered the mind of
K&#863;husrau in consequence of his youth and the pride youths have,
and the lack of experience and the lack of foresight of worthless
companions, especially at the time of my revered father&rsquo;s
illness. Some of these short-sighted ones, through the multitude of
their crimes and offences, had become hopeless of pardon and
indulgence, and imagined that by making K&#863;husrau a tool they might
conduct the affairs of State through him. They overlooked the truth
that acts of sovereignty and world rule are not things to be arranged
by the worthless endeavours of defective intellects. The just Creator
bestows them on him whom he considers fit for this glorious and exalted
duty, and on such a person doth He fit the robe of honour.</p>

</div>
<p class="par first">As the futile imaginations of the seditious and
short-sighted had no result but disgrace and regret, the affairs of the
kingdom were confirmed in the hands of this suppliant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>at the
throne of Allah. I invariably found K&#863;husrau preoccupied and
distracted. However much, in favour and affection for him, I wished to
drive from his mind some of his fears and alarms, nothing was gained
until, at last, by the advice of those whose fortune was reversed, on
the night of Sunday, Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja 8th, of the year
mentioned (April 6th, 1605), when two gharis had passed, he made a
pretence<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2406src" href="#xd24e2406" name=
"xd24e2406src">106</a> of going to visit the tomb of His Majesty
(Akbar), and went off with 350 horsemen, who were his adherents, from
within the fort of Agra. Shortly after, one of the lamp attendants who
was acquainted with the Waz&#299;ru-l-mulk gave him the news of
K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s flight. The Vizier took him to the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257;, who, as the news seemed true, came in a
distracted state of mind to the door of the private apartments and said
to one of the eunuchs, &ldquo;Take in my request and say that I have a
necessary representation to make, and let the king honour me by coming
out.&rdquo; As such an affair had not entered my thoughts I supposed
that news had come from the Deccan or Gujarat. When I came out and
heard what the news was, I asked, &ldquo;What must be done? Shall I
mount myself, or shall I send K&#863;hurram?&rdquo; The
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; submitted that he would go if I ordered it.
&ldquo;Let it be so,&rdquo; I said. Afterwards he said, &ldquo;If he
will not turn back on my advice, and takes up arms, what must be
done?&rdquo; Then I said, &ldquo;If he will go in no way on the right
road, do not consider a crime anything that results from your action.
Kingship regards neither son nor son-in-law. No one is a relation to a
king.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When I had said these words and other things, and had
dismissed him, it occurred to me that K&#863;husrau was very much
annoyed with him, and that in consequence of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>dignity
and nearness (to me) which he (the Am&#299;r) enjoyed, he was an object
of envy to his equals and contemporaries.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2413src" href="#xd24e2413" name="xd24e2413src">107</a> Perhaps
they might devise treachery and destroy him. I therefore ordered
Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk to recall him, and selecting in his place
S&#863;haik&#863;h Far&#299;d Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;-beg&#299;
commanded him to start off at once, and to take with him the mansabdars
and ahadis who were on guard. Ihtim&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n the
<i>kotw&#257;l</i> was made scout and intelligence officer. I
determined, God willing, to start off myself when it was day.
Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk brought back the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257;.</p>
<p class="par">About this time, Ah&#803;mad Beg K&#863;h&#257;n and
D&#363;st Muh&#803;ammad K&#863;h&#257;n had been sent off to
Kabul,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2421src" href="#xd24e2421" name=
"xd24e2421src">108</a> and had got as far as Sikandra, which was on
K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s route. On his arrival they came out of their
tents with some of their people, and returned and waited on me with the
news that K&#863;husrau had taken the Panjab road and was hastening on.
It occurred to me that he might change his route and go somewhere else.
As his maternal uncle, M&#257;n Singh, was in Bengal, it occurred to
many of the servants of the State that he might go in that direction. I
sent out on every side, and ascertained that he was making for the
Panjab. Meantime day dawned, and in reliance on the grace and favour of
God Almighty, and with clear resolve, I mounted, withheld by nothing
and no one.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;In truth, he who is pursued by sorrow.</p>
<p class="line">Knows not how the road is or how he may travel it.</p>

<p class="par">When I reached the venerable mausoleum of my revered
father, which is three kos from the city, I begged for aid to my
courage from the spirit of that honoured one. About this time they
captured and brought in<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2445src" href=
"#xd24e2445" name="xd24e2445src">109</a> M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;asan,
son of M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, who had proposed to
accompany K&#863;husrau. He could not deny it when I questioned him,
and I ordered them to tie his hands and mount him on an
elephant.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2448src" href="#xd24e2448" name=
"xd24e2448src">110</a> This was the first good omen manifested through
the kindness and blessing of that venerable one. At midday, as it had
become exceedingly hot, having rested awhile under the shade of a tree,
I said to the K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am that we, with all our
composure, were in such a state that we had not taken till now our
regular allowance of opium, which it was the practice to take the first
thing in the morning, and no one had reminded us of the omission. We
might imagine from this what was now the condition of that graceless
one (K&#863;husrau).<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2451src" href=
"#xd24e2451" name="xd24e2451src">111</a></p>
<p class="par">My trouble was this, that my son without any cause or
reason should become an opponent and an enemy. If I should make no
endeavour to capture him, the fractious or rebellious would have an
instrument, or else he would take his own way and go for an asylum to
the &#362;zbegs or the Persians, and contempt would fall upon my
government. On this account, having made a special point of capturing
him, I went on after a short rest two or three kos beyond pargana
Mathura, which is 20 kos from Agra, and I alighted at one of the
villages of that pargana where there is a tank.</p>
<p class="par">When K&#863;husrau arrived at Mathura, he met
H&#803;usain Beg Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;, who was of those who had
received favours from my revered father and was coming from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>Kabul to wait on me. As it is the temperament of
the Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;s to be seditious and turbulent,
K&#863;husrau regarded<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2460src" href=
"#xd24e2460" name="xd24e2460src">112</a> this meeting as a godsend, and
made H&#803;usain Beg the captain and guide of 200 or 300 Badakhshan
Aim&#257;qs, who were with him.</p>
<p class="par">Anyone whom they met, they plundered of horses and
goods. Merchants and conveyers of goods were plundered by these
rascals, and wheresoever they went men&rsquo;s wives and children were
not safe from the calamity of these wretches. With his own eyes
K&#863;husrau was witnessing the oppression practised in the hereditary
dominions of his ancestors, and after being a witness of the improper
deeds of these rascals he a thousand times every moment wished death
for himself. Finally, he had no remedy but to temporize with and
support those dogs. If good luck and fortune had assisted him in his
affairs, he would have made repentance and regret his voucher, and come
without any deceit to wait on me. God, who knows the world of secrets,
knows that I should have passed over his offences entirely and shown
him such favour and affection that to the extent of a hair&rsquo;s
point no estrangement or fear would have remained upon his mind.
Inasmuch as during the lifetime of the late king (Akbar) an intention
of joining in the sedition of some of the rebels had manifested itself
in his mind, and he knew that this had come to my knowledge, he placed
no reliance on my kindness and affection. His mother, while I was
prince, in grief at his ways and behaviour and the misconduct of her
brother M&#257;dho Singh,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2466src" href=
"#xd24e2466" name="xd24e2466src">113</a> killed herself by swallowing
opium (<i>tiry&#257;q</i>).<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2472src" href=
"#xd24e2472" name="xd24e2472src">114</a> What shall I write of her
excellences and goodness? She had perfect intelligence, and her
devotion to me was such that she would have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>sacrificed a thousand sons and brothers for one
hair of mine. She constantly wrote to K&#863;husrau and urged him to be
sincere and affectionate to me. When she saw that it was of no use and
that it was unknown how far he would be led away, she from the
indignation and high spirit which are inherent in the Rajput character
determined upon death. Her mind was several times disturbed, for such
feelings were hereditary, and her ancestors and her brothers had
occasionally showed signs of madness, but after a time had recovered.
At a time when I had gone hunting, on Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja 26th,
1013<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2480src" href="#xd24e2480" name=
"xd24e2480src">115</a> (May 6th, 1605), she in her agitation swallowed
a quantity of opium, and quickly passed away. It was as if she had
foreseen this behaviour of her unworthy son.</p>
<p class="par">My first marriage and that at the commencement of my
adolescence was with her. After K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s birth I gave her
the title of S&#863;h&#257;h Begam. When she could not endure the bad
conduct of her son and brother towards me she became disgusted with
life and died, thereby escaping the present grief and sorrow. In
consequence of her death, from the attachment I had for her, I passed
some days without any kind of pleasure in life or existence, and for
four days, which amount to 32 watches, I took nothing in the shape of
food or drink. When this tale was told to my revered father, a letter
of condolence of excessive kindness and affection reached this devoted
disciple, and he sent me a robe of honour and the auspicious turban
tied just as he had taken it off his head. This favour threw water on
the flame of my grief and afforded complete quiet and repose to my
unquietude and disturbance. My intention in relating these
circumstances is to point out that no evil fortune is greater than when
a son, through the impropriety <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57"
href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>of his conduct and his
unapproved methods of behaviour, causes the death of his mother and
becomes contumacious and rebellious to his father, without cause or
reason, but simply through his own imaginations and futile ideas, and
chooses to avoid the blessing of waiting upon him. Inasmuch as the
Almighty Avenger lays a proper punishment on each action, of necessity
his condition finally came to this, that he was caught under the worst
circumstances, and falling from a position of trust became captive to
perpetual incarceration.</p>

<p class="par first">To sum up, on Tuesday, Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja
10th, I alighted at the station of Ho&#7693;al.<a class="noteref" id=

S&#863;haik&#863;h Far&#299;d Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; and a band of
valiant men were chosen to pursue K&#863;husrau and became the vanguard
of the victorious army. I sent back D&#363;st Muh&#803;ammad, who was
in attendance on me, on account of his previous service and his white
beard, to take charge of the fort of Agra and of the zan&#257;na and
the treasuries. When leaving Agra, I had placed the city in the charge
of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula and Waz&#299;ru-l-mulk. I now said to
D&#363;st Muh&#803;ammad, &ldquo;As we are going to the Panjab, and
that province is in the diwani of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula, you will
despatch him to us, and will imprison and keep watch over the

nephews and cousins?&rdquo; After the dispatch of D&#363;st
Muh&#803;ammad, Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk became bakhshi.</p>
<p class="par">On Wednesday I alighted at Palwal, and on Thursday at
Far&#299;d&#257;b&#257;d; on Friday, the 13th, I reached Delhi.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=

hastened to the venerated tomb of Hum&#257;y&#363;n, and there besought
help in my purpose, and with my own hand distributed money to poor
persons and dervishes. Thence turning to the shrine of the venerable
saint S&#863;haik&#863;h Niz&#804;&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n Auliy&#257;, I
performed the dues of pilgrimage. After this I gave a portion<a class=

Anj&#363; and another portion to H&#803;ak&#299;m Muz&#804;affar that
they might divide it amongst the poor and dervishes. On Saturday the
14th I stayed in Sar&#257;y Narela.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2509src"
href="#xd24e2509" name="xd24e2509src">119</a> This rest-house
(<i>sar&#257;y</i>) K&#863;husrau had burned as he went.</p>
<p class="par">The rank of &#256;q&#257; Mull&#257;, brother of

servant, was fixed in original and increase at 1,000 with 300 horse. He
was in close attendance during this journey. Considering that some of
the Aim&#257;qs attached to the royal army were in league with
K&#863;husrau, and fearing that consequently some fraud or sedition
might enter their minds, 2,000 rupees were given to their leaders to
distribute amongst their men and make them hopeful of the
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; favour. I gave money to S&#863;haik&#863;h
Faz&#803;lu-llah and R&#257;ja Dh&#299;rdhar to distribute to faqirs
and brahmans on the road. I gave orders that to R&#257;n&#257;
S&#863;hankar in Ajmir should be given 30,000 rupees by way of
assistance for his expenditure.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 16th, I reached the pargana of

"#xd24e2519" name="xd24e2519src">120</a> This station and place used to
be very propitious to my gracious father and honoured ancestors, and
two great victories had been gained in it. One was the defeat of
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m Lod&#299;, which was won by the might of the
victorious hosts of His Majesty Fird&#363;s-mak&#257;n&#299;. The story
of this has been written in the histories of the time. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>The
second victory was over the wicked Hem&#363;, and was manifested from
the world of fortune in the beginning of the reign of my revered
father, as has been described by me in detail.</p>
<p class="par">At the time that K&#863;husrau had left Delhi and was
proceeding to Panipat, it happened that Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n
had arrived there. When shortly before K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s arrival he
heard of this affair, he sent his children across the Jumna and bravely
determined to hasten on and throw himself into the fort of Lahore
before K&#863;husrau should arrive. About this time
&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m also reached Panipat from Lahore, and
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n suggested to him that he too should send
his children across the river, and should stand aside and await the
victorious standards of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r. As he was lethargic and
timid, he could not make up his mind to do this, and delayed so much
that K&#863;husrau arrived. He went out and waited on him, and either
voluntarily or in a state of agitation agreed to accompany him. He
obtained the title of Malik Anwar and the position of vizier.
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n, like a brave man, turned towards Lahore,
and on his road informed everyone and everybody of the servants of the
court and the <i>karoriy&#257;n</i>, and the merchants whom he came
across, of the exodus of K&#863;husrau. Some he took with him, and
others he told to stand aside out of the way. After that, the servants
of God were relieved of the plundering by robbers and oppressors. Most
probably, if Sayyid Kam&#257;l in Delhi, and Dil&#257;war
K&#863;h&#257;n at Panipat, had shown courage and determination, and
had blocked K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s path, his disorderly force would not
have been able to resist and would have scattered, and he himself would
have been captured. The fact is that their talents (<i>himmat</i>) were
not equal to this, but afterwards each made amends for his fault, viz.,
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n, by his rapid march, entered the fort of
Lahore before K&#863;husrau reached it, and by this notable service
made amends for his earlier shortcoming, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

manfully exerted himself in the engagement with K&#863;husrau, as will
be described in its own place.</p>
<p class="par">On Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja 17th the royal standards
were set up in the pargana of Karn&#257;l. Here I raised
&#703;&#256;bid&#299;n K&#863;hw&#257;ja, son of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Kal&#257;n J&#363;yb&#257;r&#299; and <i>p&#299;rz&#257;da</i>
(spiritual adviser), son of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n &#362;zbeg,
who had come in the time of my revered father, to the rank of 1,000.
S&#863;haik&#863;h Niz&#804;&#257;m Thaneswar&#299;, who was one of the
notorious impostors (<i>s&#863;hayy&#257;d&#257;n</i>) of the age,
waited on K&#863;husrau, and having gratified him with pleasant news,
again<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2542src" href="#xd24e2542" name=
"xd24e2542src">121</a> led him out of the (right) path, and then came
to wait on me. As I had heard of these transactions, I gave him his
road expenses and told him to depart for the auspicious place of
pilgrimage (Mecca). On the 19th the halt was in pargana
S&#863;h&#257;h&#257;b&#257;d. Here there was very little water, but it
happened that heavy rain fell, so that all were rejoiced.</p>
<p class="par">I promoted S&#863;haik&#863;h Ah&#803;mad
L&#257;hor&#299;, who from my princehood had filled the relationship of
service and discipleship and the position of a house-born one
(<i>k&#863;h&#257;naz&#257;da</i>) to the office of
M&#299;r-i-&#703;Adl (Chief Justice). Disciples<a class="noteref" id=

sincere followers were presented on his introduction, and to each it
was necessary to give the token<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2559src"

(<i>s&#863;hast <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=

recommendation (?). At the time of initiation some words of advice were
given to the disciple: he must not confuse or darken his years with
sectarian quarrels, but must follow the rule of universal peace with
regard to religions; he must not kill any living creature with his own
hand, and must not flay anything. The only exceptions are in battle and
the chase.</p>

<p class="par">On Tuesday the 24th of the same month they captured five
of the attendants and comrades of K&#863;husrau. Two of <span class=

who confessed to his service, I ordered to be thrown under the feet of
elephants, and three who denied were placed in custody that enquiry
might be made. On Farward&#299;n 12th of the first year of my reign,
M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;usain and N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299; the
<i>kotw&#257;l</i> entered Lahore, and on the 24th of the same month a
messenger of Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n arrived (there) with news
that K&#863;husrau was moving on Lahore and that they should be on
their guard. On the same day the city gates were guarded and
strengthened, and two days later Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n entered
the fort with a few men and began to strengthen the towers and walls.
Wherever these were broken and thrown down he repaired them, and,
placing cannon and swivel guns on the citadel, he prepared for battle.
Assembling the small number of the royal servants who were in the fort,
they were assigned their several duties, and the people of the city
also with loyalty gave their assistance. Two days later, and when all
was ready, K&#863;husrau arrived, and, having fixed a place for his
camp, gave orders to invest<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2627src" href=
"#xd24e2627" name="xd24e2627src">128</a> the city and to prepare for
battle, and to burn one of the gates on any side where one could be got
at. &ldquo;After taking the fort,&rdquo; he said to his wicked crew,
&ldquo;I will give orders to plunder the city for seven days and to
make captive the women and children.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This doomed lot set fire to a gate, and Dil&#257;war Beg
K&#863;h&#257;n, H&#803;usain Beg the d&#299;w&#257;n, and
N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299; the kotwal built a wall inside opposite
the gateway.</p>
<p class="par">Meantime Sa&#703;&#299;d K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of
those appointed to Kashmir and was now encamped on the Chen&#257;b,
having heard the news, started rapidly for Lahore. When he reached the
Ravi he sent word to the garrison of the fort that he came with a loyal
intention and that they should admit him. They sent someone at night
and conducted him and some of his men inside. When the siege had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>lasted nine days, news of the approach of the
royal army came repeatedly to K&#863;husrau and his adherents. They
became helpless (<i>b&#299; p&#257;</i>), and made up their minds that
they must face the victorious army.</p>
<p class="par">As Lahore is one of the greatest places in Hindustan, a
great number of people gathered in six or seven days. It was reported
on good authority that 10,000 or 12,000 horse were collected, and had
left the city with the view of making a night attack on the royal
vanguard. This news was brought to me at the <i>sar&#257;y</i> of
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; &#703;Al&#299; on the night of Thursday the 16th.
Although it rained heavily in the night I beat the drum of march and
mounted. Arriving in Sult&#804;&#257;np&#363;r at dawn I remained there
till noon. By chance, at this place and hour the victorious army
encountered that ill-fated band. Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk had brought a dish
of roast meat,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2650src" href="#xd24e2650"
name="xd24e2650src">129</a> and I was turning towards it with zest when
the news of the battle was brought to me. Though I had a longing to eat
the roast meat, I immediately took a mouthful by way of augury and
mounted, and without waiting for the coming up of men and without
regard to the smallness of my force I went off in all haste. However
much I demanded my <i>chiltah</i> (wadded coat), they did not produce
it. My only arms were a spear and sword, but I committed myself to the
favour of God and started off without hesitation. At first my escort
did not number more than fifty horsemen; no one had expected a fight
that day. In fine, when I reached the head of the bridge of
Gobindw&#257;l,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2658src" href="#xd24e2658"
name="xd24e2658src">130</a> 400 or 500 horse, good and bad, had come
together. When I had crossed the bridge the news of a victory was
brought to me. The bearer of the good news was S&#863;hams&#299;,
<i>t&#363;s&#863;hakch&#299;</i> (wardrobe man), and for his good news
he obtained the title of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href=
"#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>K&#863;h&#363;s&#863;h-k&#863;habar
K&#863;h&#257;n. M&#299;r Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain, whom I
had sent previously to advise K&#863;husrau, came up at the same time
and said such things about the number and bravery of
K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s men as frightened his hearers. Though news of the
victory came continuously, this simple-minded Sayyid would not believe
it, and expressed incredulity that such an army as he had seen could be
defeated by S&#863;haik&#863;h Far&#299;d&rsquo;s force, which was
small and not properly equipped. When they brought
K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s litter<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2667src" href=
"#xd24e2667" name="xd24e2667src">131</a> with two of his eunuchs, the
M&#299;r admitted what had happened. Then, alighting from his horse, he
placed his head at my feet and professed every kind of humility and
submission, and said that there could be no higher or more lofty
fortune than this.</p>
<p class="par">In this command S&#863;haik&#863;h Far&#299;d behaved
with sincerity and devotion. The Sayyids of B&#257;rha, who are of the
brave ones of the age, and who have held this place in every fight in
which they have been, formed the van. Saif K&#863;h&#257;n, son of
Sayyid Mah&#803;m&#363;d K&#863;h&#257;n B&#257;rha, the head of the
tribe, had shown great bravery and had received seventeen wounds.
Sayyid Jal&#257;l, also of the brethren of this band, received an arrow
in his temple and died a few days later. At the time when the Sayyids
of B&#257;rha, who were not more than fifty or sixty in number, having
received wounds from 1,500 Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; horsemen, had
been cut to pieces, Sayyid Kam&#257;l, who, with his brothers, had been
appointed to support the van, came up on the flank and fought with
wondrous bravery and manliness. After that the men of the right wing
raised the cry of <i>P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h sal&#257;mat</i>
(&ldquo;Long live the King&rdquo;) and charged, and the rebels hearing
the words, gave up and scattered abroad to various hiding-places. About
400 Aim&#257;qs became crushed on the plain of anger and overcome by
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>victorious army. K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s box of
jewels and precious things which he had always with him, fell into our
hands.</p>

<p class="par first">Short-sighted men in Allahabad had urged me also
to rebel against my father. Their words were extremely unacceptable and
disapproved by me. I know what sort of endurance a kingdom would have,
the foundations of which were laid on hostility to a father, and was
not moved by the evil counsels of such worthless men, but acting
according to the dictates of reason and knowledge I waited on my
father, my guide, my <i>qibla</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2719src"
href="#xd24e2719" name="xd24e2719src">133</a> and my visible God, and
as a result of this good purpose it went well with me.</p>
<p class="par">In the evening of the day of K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s
flight I gave R&#257;ja B&#257;so, who is a trusty zamindar of the
hill-country of Lahore, leave to go to that frontier, and, wherever he
heard news or trace of K&#863;husrau, to make every effort to capture
him. I also appointed Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n and M&#299;rz&#257;
&#703;Al&#299; Akbars&#863;h&#257;h&#299; to a large force, which was
to pursue K&#863;husrau in whatever direction he might go. I resolved
with myself that if K&#863;husrau went to Kabul, I would follow him and
not turn back till he was captured. If not delaying in Kabul he should
go on to Badakhshan and those regions, I would leave Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n in Kabul and return myself (to India). My reason for
not going to Badakhshan was that that wretch would (in that case)
certainly ally himself with the &#362;zbegs, and the disgrace would
attach to this State. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66"
name="pb66">66</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">On the day on which the royal troops were ordered to
pursue K&#863;husrau, 15,000 rupees were given to Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n and 20,000 to the ahadis, and 10,000 more were sent
with the army to be given to whom it might be necessary to give it on
the way.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 28th, the victorious camp was pitched
at Jaip&#257;l,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2730src" href="#xd24e2730"
name="xd24e2730src">134</a> which lies seven kos from Lahore. On the
same day K&#863;husrau arrived with a few men on the bank of the
Chen&#257;b. The brief account of what had happened is that after his
defeat those who had escaped with him from the battle became divided in
opinion. The Afghans and Indians, who were mostly his old retainers,
wished to double back like foxes into Hindustan, and to become a source
of rebellion and trouble there. H&#803;usain Beg, whose people and
family and treasure were in the direction of Kabul, suggested going to
Kabul. In the end, as action was taken according to the wish of
H&#803;usain Beg, the Hindustanis and the Afghans decided to separate
themselves from him. On arriving at the Chen&#257;b, he proposed to
cross at the ferry of S&#863;h&#257;hp&#363;r, which is one of the
recognized crossings, but as he could find no boats there he made for
the ferry of Sodharah, where his people got one boat without boatmen
and another full of firewood and grass.</p>
<p class="par">The ferries over the rivers had been stopped because
before K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s defeat orders had been given to all the
jagirdars and the superintendents of roads and crossings in the subah
of the Panjab that as this kind of dispute had arisen they must all be
on the alert. H&#803;usain Beg wished to transfer the men from the boat
with firewood and grass to the other, so that they might convey
K&#863;husrau across. At this juncture arrived K&#299;lan,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e2735src" href="#xd24e2735" name=
"xd24e2735src">135</a> son-in-law of Kam&#257;l <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>Chaudhar&#299; of Sodharah, and saw a body of men
about to cross in the night. He cried out to the boatmen that there was
an order from the king Jah&#257;ng&#299;r forbidding unknown men from
crossing in the night, and that they must be careful. Owing to the
noise and uproar, the people of the neighbourhood gathered together,
and Kam&#257;l&rsquo;s son-in-law took from the boatmen the pole with
which they propel the boat, and which in Hindustani is called
<i>ball&#299;</i>, and thus made the boat unmanageable. Although money
was offered to the boatmen, not one would ferry them over. News went to
Ab&#363;-l-Q&#257;sim Namak&#299;n, who was at Gujarat, near the
Chen&#257;b, that a body of men were wanting to cross the river by
night, and he at once came to the ferry in the night with his sons and
some horsemen. Things went to such a length that H&#803;usain Beg shot
arrows at the boatmen,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2743src" href=
"#xd24e2743" name="xd24e2743src">136</a> and Kam&#257;l&rsquo;s
son-in-law also took to shooting arrows from the river-bank. For four
kos the boat took its own way down the river, until at the end of the
night it grounded, and try as they would they could not get it off.
Meantime it became day. Ab&#363;-l-Q&#257;sim and K&#863;hw&#257;ja
K&#863;hiz&#803;r K&#863;h&#257;n, who by the efforts of Hil&#257;l
K&#863;h&#257;n had assembled on this (? the west) side of the river,
fortified its west bank, and the zamindars fortified it on the
east.</p>
<p class="par">Before this affair of K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s, I had sent
Hil&#257;l K&#863;h&#257;n as <i>saz&#257;wal</i> to the army appointed
for Kashm&#299;r under Sa&#703;&#299;d K&#863;h&#257;n, and by chance
he arrived in the neighbourhood (of the ferry) that same night; he came
in the nick of time, and his efforts had great effect in bringing
together Ab&#363;-l-Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n Namak&#299;n, and
K&#863;hw&#257;ja K&#863;hiz&#803;r K&#863;h&#257;n in the capture of
K&#863;husrau.</p>
<p class="par">On the morning of Sunday, the 24th of the aforesaid
month, people on elephants and in boats captured K&#863;husrau, and on
Monday, the last day of the month, news of this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>reached
me in the garden of M&#299;rz&#257; K&#257;mr&#257;n. I immediately
ordered the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; to go to Gujarat and to bring
K&#863;husrau to wait on me.</p>
<p class="par">In counsels on State affairs and government it often
happens that I act according to my own judgment and prefer my own
counsel to that of others. In the first instance I had elected to wait
on my revered father from Allahabad in opposition to the advice of my
faithful servants, and I obtained the blessing of serving him, and this
was for my spiritual and temporal good. By the same course of conduct I
had become king. The second instance was the pursuit of K&#863;husrau,
from which I was not held back by taking time to ascertain the
(auspicious) hour, etc., and from which I took no rest until I captured
him. It is a strange thing that after I had started I asked
H&#803;ak&#299;m &#703;Al&#299;, who is learned in mathematics, how the
hour of my departure had been (i.e. whether propitious or not), and he
replied that in order to obtain my object if I had wished to select an
hour, there could not have been for years one selected better than that
in which I mounted.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, Muh&#803;arram 3rd, 1015, in
M&#299;rz&#257; K&#257;mr&#257;n&rsquo;s garden, they brought
K&#863;husrau before me with his hands tied and chains on his legs from
the left side<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2762src" href="#xd24e2762"
name="xd24e2762src">137</a> after the manner and custom of Ching&#299;z
K&#863;h&#257;n. They made H&#803;usain Beg stand on his right hand and
&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m on his left. K&#863;husrau stood weeping
and trembling between them. H&#803;usain Beg, with the idea that it
might profit him, began to speak wildly. When his purport became
apparent to me I did not allow him to continue talking, but handed over
K&#863;husrau in chains, and ordered these two villains to be put in
the skins of an ox and an ass, and that they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>should
be mounted on asses with their faces to the tail<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2767src" href="#xd24e2767" name="xd24e2767src">138</a> and thus
taken round the city. As the ox-hide dried more quickly than that of
the ass, H&#803;usain Beg remained alive for four watches and died from
suffocation. &#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m, who was in the ass&rsquo;s
skin and to whom they gave some refreshment from outside, remained
alive.</p>
<p class="par">From Monday, the last day of
Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja, until the 9th of Muh&#803;arram of the
aforesaid year, I remained in M&#299;rz&#257; K&#257;mr&#257;n&rsquo;s
garden because the time was unpropitious.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2772src" href="#xd24e2772" name="xd24e2772src">139</a> I bestowed
Bhairawal,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2775src" href="#xd24e2775" name=
"xd24e2775src">140</a> where the battle had taken place, on
S&#863;haik&#863;h Far&#299;d, and rewarded him with the high title of
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n. For the sake of good government I
ordered posts to be set up on both sides of the road from the garden to
the city, and ordered them to hang up and impale the seditious
Aim&#257;qs and others who had taken part in the rebellion. Thus each
one of them received an extraordinary punishment. I gave headship to
those landholders who had shown loyalty, and to every one of the
Chaudhar&#299;s between the Jhelam and the Chen&#257;b I gave lands for
their support.</p>
<p class="par">Of H&#803;usain Beg&rsquo;s property there were obtained
from the house of M&#299;r Muh&#803;ammad B&#257;q&#299; nearly seven
lakhs of rupees. This was exclusive of what he had made over to other
places and of what he had with him. After this, whenever his name is
mentioned, the words<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2780src" href=

came to this Court in company with M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h he had one horse. By degrees his affairs
flourished so that he became possessed of treasure both visible and
buried, and projects of this kind entered his mind.</p>
<p class="par">While K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s affair was still in the will
of God, as there was no actual governor between Afghanistan and Agra,
which is a source of sedition and mischief, and, fearing that
K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s affair might be prolonged, I ordered my son
Parw&#299;z to leave some of the sardars to look after the
R&#257;n&#257; and to come to Agra with &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n
and a body of those nearly connected with him in the service. He was to
consider the protection and management of that region his special
charge. But by the blessed favour of Allah, K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s
affair was settled before Parw&#299;z arrived in Agra; I accordingly
ordered my aforesaid son to come and wait on me.</p>
<p class="par">On Wednesday, Muh&#803;arram 8th, I auspiciously entered
the fort of Lahore. A number of loyalists represented to me that my
return to Agra would be for the good of the State at this time when
much was going amiss in Gujarat, in the Deccan, and in Bengal. This
counsel did not meet with my approval, for the reports of
S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of Qandahar, showed
that the officers of the Persian border were meditating an attack on
that fortress. They had been moved thereto by the machinations of the
residuum of the Mirzas of Qandahar&rsquo;s army, which was always
shaking the chain of contention. The Persian officers had written
letters to these malcontents, and there was likelihood of a
disturbance. It occurred to me that the death of His Majesty Akbar and
the unreasonable outbreak of K&#863;husrau might put an edge on their
design, and that they might attack Qandahar. What had occurred to my
mind became a realized fact. The governor of Far&#257;h<span class=
"corr" id="xd24e2799" title="Source: .">,</span> the Malik of
S&#299;stan, and the jagirdars of that neighbourhood, with the
assistance of H&#803;usain K&#863;h&#257;n, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>governor
of Herat, invaded Qandahar. Praise is due to the manliness and courage
of S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, who planted his foot firmly
like a man, and strengthened the fort, and seated himself on the top of
the third(?) citadel of the aforesaid fort in such a manner that
outsiders could see his entertainments. During the siege he girded not
his loins, but with bare head and feet arranged parties of pleasure;
yet no day passed that he did not send a force from the fort to meet
the foe and did not make manly efforts. This went on as long as he was
in the fort. The Qizilb&#257;s&#863;h army had invested on three sides.
When news of this reached Lahore it was clearly advisable to remain in
that neighbourhood. A large force was immediately appointed under the
leadership of M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;, who was
accompanied by a number of men of rank and servants of the Court, such
as Qar&#257; Beg and Tuk&#863;hta Beg, who had been promoted with the
titles of Qar&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n and Sard&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n. I
appointed M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; to a mansab of 5,000
personal, and horsemen, and bestowed drums on him. M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;zi was the son of M&#299;rz&#257; J&#257;n&#299;
Tark&#863;h&#257;n, king of Thathah (Sind), and by the efforts of
&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n
that country had been conquered in the reign of the late king. The
country of Thathah was included in his jagir, and he held the rank with
personality and horsemen of 5,000. After his death his son
M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;zi was raised to his rank and service.
Their ancestors were among the amirs of Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain
<span class="corr" id="xd24e2804" title=
"Source: Mirza">M&#299;rz&#257;</span> B&#257;y-qar&#257;, the ruler of
Khurasan, and they were originally descended from the amirs of
T&#299;m&#363;r (<i>&#7778;&#257;h&#803;ib-qir&#257;n&#299;</i>).
K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;&#256;qil was appointed bakhshi of this army;
43,000 rupees were given to Qar&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n for road
expenses, and 15,000 to Naqd&#299; Beg and Qil&#299;j Beg, who were to
accompany M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;. I determined to stay
at Lahore in order to settle this matter and with the intention of a
tour to Kabul. About this time the rank of H&#803;ak&#299;m
Fath&#803;u-llah was fixed, original and increased, at 1,000
personality and 300 horse. As S&#863;haik&#863;h H&#803;usain
J&#257;m&#299; had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72"
name="pb72">72</a>]</span>had dreams about me which had come true, I
gave him twenty lakhs of dams, equivalent to 30,000 or 40,000 rupees,
for the expenses of himself and his monastery and the dervishes who
were with him. On the 22nd I promoted &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
to the rank of 2,500 personal and 500 horse, original and increased. I
ordered to be given to the ahadis two lakhs of rupees to be paid in
advance and deducted by degrees from their monthly pay. I bestowed
6,000 rupees on Q&#257;sim Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, the son-in-law of
S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, and 3,000 rupees on Sayyid
Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">In Gobindw&#257;l, which is on the river B&#299;y&#257;h
(Beas), there was a Hindu named Arjun,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2814src" href="#xd24e2814" name="xd24e2814src">142</a> in the
garments of sainthood and sanctity, so much so that he had captured
many of the simple-hearted of the Hindus, and even of the ignorant and
foolish followers of Islam, by his ways and manners, and they had
loudly sounded the drum of his holiness. They called him
<i>G&#363;r&#363;</i>, and from all sides stupid people crowded to
worship and manifest complete faith in him. For three or four
generations (of spiritual successors) they had kept this shop warm.
Many times it occurred to me to put a stop to this vain affair or to
bring him into the assembly of the people of Islam.</p>
<p class="par">At last when K&#863;husrau passed along this road this
insignificant fellow proposed to wait upon him. K&#863;husrau happened
to halt at the place where he was, and he came out and did homage to
him. He behaved to K&#863;husrau in certain special ways, and made on
his forehead a finger-mark in saffron, which the Indians
(Hinduw&#257;n) call <i>qas&#863;hqa</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2825src" href="#xd24e2825" name="xd24e2825src">143</a> and is
considered propitious. When this came to my ears and I clearly
understood his folly, I ordered them <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>to produce him and handed
over his houses, dwelling-places, and children to Murtaz&#803;&#257;
K&#863;h&#257;n, and having confiscated his property commanded that he
should be put to death.</p>
<p class="par">There were two men named R&#257;j&#363; and Amb&#257;,
who, under the shadow of the protection of the eunuch Daulat
K&#863;h&#257;n, made their livelihood by oppression and tyranny, and
had done many acts of oppression in the few days that K&#863;husrau was
before Lahore. I ordered R&#257;j&#363; to the gallows and a fine to be
taken from Amb&#257;, who was reputed to be wealthy. In short, 15,000
rupees were collected from him, which sum I ordered them to expend on
<i>bulg&#863;hur-k&#863;h&#257;nas</i> (refectories) and in
charity.</p>
<p class="par">Sa&#703;du-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Sa&#703;d
K&#863;h&#257;n, was promoted to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,000
horse.</p>
<p class="par">In his great desire to wait upon me, Parw&#299;z
traversed long distances in a short time, in the rainy season and
incessant rain, and on Thursday, the 29th, when two watches and three
<i>gha&#7771;&#299;</i> of day had passed, obtained the blessing of
seeing me. With exceeding kindness and affection, I took him into the
embrace of favour and kissed his forehead.</p>
<p class="par">When this disgraceful conduct showed itself in
K&#863;husrau, I had resolved not to delay in any place till I had
captured him. There was a probability that he might turn back towards
Hindustan, so it appeared impolitic to leave Agra empty, as it was the
centre of the State, the abode of the ladies of the holy harem, and the
depository of the world&rsquo;s treasures. On these accounts I had
written when leaving Agra to Parw&#299;z, saying that his loyalty had
had this result, that K&#863;husrau had fled and that Fortune had
turned her face toward himself; that I had started in pursuit of
K&#863;husrau, and that he should consequently dispose of the affairs
of the R&#257;n&#257; in some way according to the necessity of the
time, and for the benefit of the kingdom should himself come quickly to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>Agra. I had delivered into his charge the capital
and treasury, which was equal to the wealth of
Q&#257;r&#363;n,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2852src" href="#xd24e2852"
name="xd24e2852src">144</a> and I had commended him to the God of
power. Before this letter reached Parw&#299;z, the R&#257;n&#257; had
been so humbled that he had sent to &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n to
say that as by his own acts he had come to shame and disgrace, he hoped
that he would intercede for him in such a way that the prince would be
content with his sending B&#257;gha,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2855src" href="#xd24e2855" name="xd24e2855src">145</a> who was
one of his sons. Parw&#299;z had not agreed to this, and said that
either the R&#257;n&#257; himself should come or that he should send
Karan. Meantime the news of K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s disturbance arrived,
and on its account &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n and other loyalists
agreed to the coming of B&#257;gha, who obtained the blessing of
waiting on the prince near Man&#7693;alga&#7771;h.</p>
<p class="par">Parw&#299;z, leaving R&#257;ja Jagann&#257;th and most
of the chiefs of his army, started for Agra with &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n and some of those near to him and his own attendants,
and with him brought B&#257;gha to the Court. When he came near Agra he
heard the news of the victory over K&#863;husrau and his capture, and
after resting two days an order reached him that as matters appeared
settled in all quarters he should betake himself to me, in order that
on the prescribed date he might obtain the good fortune of waiting on
me. I bestowed on him the parasol
(<i>&#257;ft&#257;b-g&#299;r</i>),<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2863src"
href="#xd24e2863" name="xd24e2863src">146</a> which is one of the signs
of royalty, and I gave him the rank of 10,000 and sent an order to the
officials to grant him a <i>tank&#863;hw&#257;h</i> jagir. At this time
I sent M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Al&#299; Beg to Kashmir; 10,000 rupees
were delivered to Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; &#703;Izzatu-llah to divide
amongst faqirs and the poor of Kabul. Ah&#803;mad Beg K&#863;h&#257;n
was promoted to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,250 horse, original
and extra. At the same time Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been sent
to Burhanpur to bring the children of D&#257;niy&#257;l, returned after
an absence of 6 months <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75"
name="pb75">75</a>]</span>22 days and had the honour of an audience,
and related in detail what had occurred in those regions.</p>

who was governor of Delhi under the late king, was dismissed from the
post (by me) for certain ill-deeds done by his men, and was entered
amongst the holders of subsistence lands and the
<i>arb&#257;b-i-sa&#703;&#257;dat</i>.</p>
<p class="par">In the whole of the hereditary dominions, both the crown
lands and the jagirs, I ordered the preparation of
<i>bulg&#863;hur-k&#863;h&#257;nas</i> (free eating-houses), where
cooked food might be provided for the poor according to their
condition, and so that residents and travellers both might reap the
benefit.</p>
<p class="par">Amba<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2889src" href=

Kashm&#299;r&#299;, who was of the stock of the rulers of Kashmir, was
selected for the rank of 1,000 personal and 300 horse. On Monday,
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-&#257;k&#863;hir 9th, I gave Parw&#299;z a special
sword; and jewelled swords were presented also to
Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n Koka and the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257;. I saw D&#257;niy&#257;l&rsquo;s children, whom
Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n had brought; there were three sons and four
daughters. The boys bore the names T&#804;ahm&#363;ras&#804;,<a class=

"xd24e2895src">149</a> B&#257;ysung&#863;har, and H&#363;s&#863;hang.
Such kindness and affection were shown by me to these children as no
one thought possible. I resolved that T&#804;ahm&#363;ras&#804;, who
was the eldest, should always be in waiting on me, and the others were
handed over to the charge of my own sisters.</p>
<p class="par">A special dress of honour was sent to R&#257;ja M&#257;n
Singh in Bengal. I ordered a reward of 30 lakhs of dams to
M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;zi. I bestowed on S&#863;haik&#863;h
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m, son of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href=

K&#863;h&#257;n Koka, the rank of 1,000 personal and 300 horse, and
dignified him with the title of Kis&#863;hwar K&#863;h&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">As when I started in pursuit of K&#863;husrau I had left
my son K&#863;hurram in charge of the palaces and treasury, I now, when
that affair had been settled, ordered the said son to attend upon
Haz&#803;rat Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299; and the other ladies, and to
escort them to me. When they reached the neighbourhood of Lahore, on
Friday the 12th of the month mentioned, I embarked in a boat and went
to a village named Dahr to meet my mother, and I had the good fortune
to be received by her. After the performance of obeisance and
prostration and greeting which is due from the young to the old
according to the custom of Ching&#299;z, the rules of T&#299;m&#363;r
and common usage, and after worship of the King of the World (God), and
after finishing this business, I obtained leave to return, and
re-entered the fort of Lahore.</p>
<p class="par">On the 17th, having appointed Mu&#703;izzu-&#299;-mulk
bakhshi of the army against the R&#257;n&#257;, I dismissed him to it.
As news had come of the rebellion of R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh and his
son, Dul&#299;p, in the neighbourhood of N&#257;gor, I ordered
R&#257;ja Jagann&#257;th to proceed against them with others of the
servants of the State and Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk, and to put a stop to
this disturbance. I gave 50,000 rupees to Sard&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n,
who had been appointed to the place of S&#863;h&#257;h Beg
K&#863;h&#257;n as Governor of Qandahar, and I promoted him to the rank
of 3,000 personal and 2,500 horse. To K&#863;hiz&#803;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, the late ruler of K&#863;handesh, were given 3,000
rupees, and to his brother, Ah&#803;mad K&#863;h&#257;n,<a class=

2,500 personal and 1,500 horse. I gave him also one of my own horses. I

army of the Deccan.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2915src" href=
"#xd24e2915" name="xd24e2915src">151</a> Five thousand rupees were

<i>wak&#299;l</i> of M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Al&#299; Beg, the governor

<p class="par">News reached me that S&#863;haik&#863;h
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m B&#257;b&#257;, the Afghan, had opened a religious
establishment (lit. one of being a shaikh and having disciples) in one
of the parganas<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2926src" href="#xd24e2926"
name="xd24e2926src">152</a> of Lahore, and as his doings were
disreputable and foolish a considerable number of Afghans had collected
round him. I ordered him to be brought and handed over to Parw&#299;z
to be kept in the fort of Chunar; so this vain disturbance was put an
end to.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, 7th Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal, many of the
mansabdars and ahadis were promoted: Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n

1,300 personal and 550 horse, Qayy&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n 1,000
personal and horse, S&#863;hy&#257;m Singh 1,500 personal and 1,200
horse; in the same way forty-two mansabdars were promoted. On most days
the same observances occur. I presented Parw&#299;z with a ruby of the
value of 25,000 rupees. On Wednesday the 9th of the aforesaid month,
the 21st of S&#863;hahr&#299;war,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2931src"
href="#xd24e2931" name="xd24e2931src">153</a> after three watches and
four gharis, the feast for my solar weighing, which is the commencement
of the 38th year of my age, took place. According to custom they got
ready <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>the weighing apparatus and the scales in the house
of Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299; (his mother). At the moment appointed
blessings were invoked and I sate in the scales. Each suspending rope
was held by an elderly person who offered up prayers. The first time
the weight in gold came to three Hindustani maunds and ten seers. After
this I was weighed against several metals, perfumes, and essences, up
to twelve weighings, the details of which will be given hereafter.
Twice a year I weigh myself against gold and silver and other metals,
and against all sorts of silks and cloths, and various grains, etc.,
once at the beginning of the solar year and once at that of the lunar.
The weight of the money of the two weighings I hand over to the
different treasurers for faqirs and those in want. On the same
auspicious day I promoted Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n Koka,
who for many years had expected such a day,<a class="noteref" id=

various favours. First, I gave him the rank of 5,000 personal and
horse, and with this a special robe of honour, a jewelled sword, and
one of my own horses, with a jewelled saddle, and I gave him leave to
go to the subahdarship of the province of Bengal and Orissa, which is a
place for 50,000 horse. As a mark of honour he set off accompanied by a
large force, and two lakhs of rupees were given him as a sumptuary
allowance. My connection with his mother is such that as in my
childhood I was under her guardianship and care, I have not so much
affection for my own mother as for her. She is to me my gracious
mother, and I do not hold him less dear than my own brothers and
children. Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n is the foster-brother who is most fit
for fosterage. I gave 300,000 rupees to his auxiliaries. On this day I
sent 130,000 as a marriage present (<i>s&#257;chiq</i>) for the
daughter of Pah&#257;r&#299; (his brother Mur&#257;d), who had been
betrothed to Parw&#299;z. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href=

<p class="par">On the 22nd, B&#257;z Bah&#257;dur Qalm&#257;q, who had
long been guilty of evil practices in Bengal, by the guidance of
fortune obtained the honour of kissing my threshold. I gave him a
jewelled dagger, 8,000 rupees, and promoted him to the rank of 1,000
personal and horse. One lakh of rupees and cash and jewels were
bestowed on Parw&#299;z. Kesho D&#257;s M&#257;r&#363; was promoted to
the grade of 1,500 personal and horse. Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan, who had

from M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Az&#299;z Koka to &#703;Al&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n, the ruler of K&#863;handesh. I had had an impression
that he had a particular enmity to me on K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s account,
who was his son-in-law. From the discovery of this writing it became
clear that he had never given up his innate treachery, and had adopted
this unbecoming attitude towards my revered father also. In short, this
letter which he had written at some time to R&#257;ja &#703;Al&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>was from beginning to end full of abuse and
disapprobation, and said things which no enemy even could have written
and such as could not be attributed to anyone, and far less to one like
His Majesty, <i>&#703;Ars&#863;h-&#257;s&#863;hy&#257;n&#299;</i>, a
king and an appreciative sovereign, who from childhood had educated him
and brought him up because of what was due for services rendered by his
mother, and raised the standard of reliance on him to such a high
degree as no other person possessed. This letter fell into the hands of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan in Burhanpur amongst the
property of R&#257;ja &#703;Al&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n. He brought and
laid it before me. In reading and seeing it the hair on my limbs stood
on end. But for the consideration and due recognition of the fact that
his mother had given her milk to my father I could have killed him with
my own hand. Having procured his attendance I gave the letter into his
hand and told him to read it with a loud voice to those present. When
he saw the letter I thought his body would have parted from his soul,
but with shamelessness and impudence he read it as though he had not
written it and was reading it by order. Those present in that
paradise-like assembly of the servants of Akbar and Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
and heard the letter read, loosened the tongue of reproach and of
curses and abuse. I put the question to him, &ldquo;Leaving aside the
treacheries which in reliance on your worthless self you contrived
against <i>my</i> fortune, what was done to you by my father, who
raised you and your family from the dust of the road to such wealth and
dignity as to make you the envy of your contemporaries, that you should
write these things to the enemies of his Empire? Why did you enrol
yourself amongst the wicked and disloyal? Truly, what can one make of
an original nature and innate disposition? Since your temperament has
been nourished by the water of treachery, what else can spring up but
such actions? Passing over what you did to myself, I gave you the rank
you had held before, thinking that your treachery <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>was
directed against me only. Since it has become known that you behaved in
a similar way to your benefactor and visible Deity, I leave you to the
thoughts and actions which you formerly had and still have.&rdquo;
After these remarks his lips closed, and he was unable to make any
reply. What could he have said in the presence of such disgrace? I gave
an order to deprive him of his jagir. Although what this ingrate had
done was unpardonable, yet in the end, from certain considerations, I
passed it over.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday the 26th of the above-mentioned month was held
the marriage feast of Parw&#299;z and the daughter of Prince
Mur&#257;d. The ceremony was performed in the house of Her Highness
Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;. The entertainment was arranged in the house of
Parw&#299;z, and all who were present were exalted with all kinds of
honour and civilities. Nine thousand rupees were handed over to
S&#863;harif &#256;mul&#299; and other nobles, to be given in alms to
faqirs and other poor people.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday the 10th Rajab I left the city to hunt in
Girjhak and Nandana,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2973src" href=
"#xd24e2973" name="xd24e2973src">159</a> and took up my quarters in the
garden of R&#257;m D&#257;s, where I remained four days.</p>
<p class="par">On Wednesday the 13th the solar weighing of Parw&#299;z
took place. They weighed him twelve times against various metals and
other things, and each weighing came to two maunds and eighteen seers.
I ordered the whole to be distributed amongst faqirs. At this time the
rank of S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n was fixed at 1,500
personal and 700 horse, original and extra.</p>
<p class="par">After the march of M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;
and his force it occurred to me to send a second contingent after him.
Having bestowed on Bah&#257;dur<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2980src"

Q&#363;rbeg&#299; the rank of 1,500 personal and 800 horse, original
and extra, I started off <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href=
"#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>a body of cavalry,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e2985src" href="#xd24e2985" name="xd24e2985src">161</a> which
came to about 3,000, with him under the leadership of S&#863;h&#257;h
Beg and Muh&#803;ammad Am&#299;n. For the expenses of this force
200,000 rupees were given and 1,000 musketeers were also appointed.</p>
<p class="par">I left &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n to guard
K&#863;husrau and defend Lahore. The Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; was
deprived of the honour of waiting on me, as he had a severe illness and
remained in the city. &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299;,
who had been summoned from the R&#257;n&#257;&rsquo;s country, was
promoted to be bakhshi at headquarters, and it was ordered that in
company with &#703;Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan he should perform this
service permanently. Following my father&rsquo;s rule, I appoint two
men in association in the discharge of the chief offices, not from want
of confidence in them, but because, as they are mortal and no man is
safe from accidents or illness, if any confusion or obstacle should
present itself to one the other is there so that the affairs of the
servants of God may not come to ruin.</p>
<p class="par">At this time also news came that at the Dasahr&#257;,
which is one of the fixed feast days of the Hindus, &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n had made an incursion from K&#257;lp&#299;, which is
his jagir, into the province of Band&#299;lah, and displaying great
valour made prisoner R&#257;m Chand, son of Madh&#363;kar, who for a
long time had made a centre of disturbance in that difficult country
and taken him to K&#257;lp&#299;. For this service he was presented
with a standard and raised to 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse.</p>
<p class="par">Petitions from the subah of Bihar represented that
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n had had a battle with
Sangr&#257;m, one of the chief zamindars of Bihar, who had about 4,000
horse and innumerable foot, on account of certain opposition and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>disloyalty on rough land, and that on the field
the aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n had exerted himself manfully. In the end
Sangr&#257;m died of a gunshot wound; many of his men fell in the
battle, and those saved from the sword took to flight. Since this
distinguished affair had been brought about by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, I promoted him to the rank of 4,500 personal
and 3,500 horse.</p>
<p class="par">Three months and six days passed by in hunting; 581
animals were captured with the gun, hunting leopards and nets, and a
<i>qamarg&#257;h</i>; of these 158 were killed by my own gun. The
qamargah was held twice; on one occasion in Girjh&#257;k, when the
ladies were present, 155 animals were killed; and the second time, in
Nand&#299;na, 110.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3008src" href=
"#xd24e3008" name="xd24e3008src">162</a> The details of the animals
killed are as follows: mountain sheep, 180; mountain goats, 29; wild
asses, 10; Nilgai, 9; antelope, etc., 348.</p>
<p class="par">On Wednesday the 16th Shaww&#257;l I returned safe from
my hunting, and when one watch and six gharis of day had passed I
entered Lahore on the day named. During this hunting a strange affair
was witnessed. At Chandw&#257;lah, where a minaret had been erected, I
had wounded in the belly a black antelope. When wounded, a sound
proceeded from him such as I have never heard from any antelope, except
in the rutting season. Old hunters and those with me were astonished,
and said they never remembered nor had they heard from their fathers
that such a voice issued from an antelope except at rutting time. This
has been written down because it is not void of strangeness. I found
the flesh of the mountain goat more delicious than that of all wild
animals, although its skin is exceedingly ill-odoured, so much so that
even when tanned the scent is not destroyed. I ordered one of the
largest of the he-goats to be weighed; it was 2 maunds and 24 seers,
equal to 21 foreign maunds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href=
"#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>(Persian). I ordered a large ram to
be weighed, and it came to 2 maunds and 3 seers <i>Akbar&#299;</i>,
equal to 17 Persian (<i>wil&#257;yat&#299;</i>) maunds. The largest and
strongest of the wild asses weighed 9 maunds and 16 seers, equal to 76
Persian (wil&#257;yat&#299;) maunds. I have frequently heard from
hunters and those fond of the chase that at a certain regular time a
worm develops in the horns of the mountain ram, and that this worm
causes an irritation which induces the ram to fight with his hind, and
that if he finds no rival he strikes his head against a tree or a rock
to allay the irritation. After enquiry it seems that the same worm
appears in the horn of the female sheep, and since the female does not
fight the statement is clearly untrue. Though the flesh of the wild ass
is lawful food and most men like to eat it, it was in no way suited to
my taste.</p>
<p class="par">Inasmuch as before this time the punishment of
Dul&#299;p and of his father, R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh, had been
ordered, there now came news that Z&#257;hid K&#863;h&#257;n, the son
of &#7778;&#257;diq K&#863;h&#257;n, and &#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m,
son of S&#863;haik&#863;h Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l, and R&#257;n&#257;

another force of mansabdars and followers of the Court, had heard news
of Dul&#299;p in the neighbourhood of N&#257;gor, which is in the subah
of Ajmir, and having moved against him had found him. As he could find
no way of escape, of necessity he planted a firm foot and came to blows
with the royal army. After a short encounter he was badly beaten and
gave over many to slaughter, and himself, taking with him his own
effects, fled into the vale of ruin.</p>

curious that Jah&#257;ng&#299;r should give the 18th
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal as his birthday, while the authorities give it
as the 17th. Probably the mistake has arisen from
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s writing Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal instead of
S&#863;hahr&#299;war. His birthday was Ras&#863;hn the 18th day of
S&#863;hahr&#299;war (see Akbarn&#257;ma, ii, 344), but it was the 17th
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal. See Muh&#803;ammad H&#257;d&#299;&rsquo;s
preface, p. 2, and Beale, and Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s own statement
a few lines above. Possibly Jah&#257;ng&#299;r wished to make out that
he was born on the 18th Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal and a Thursday,
because he regarded Thursday as a blessed day (<i>mub&#257;rak

not so in the MSS. If it were, we should have thirteen instead of

the 8th and 7th regulations into one ordinance. With regard to the
regulation about releasing the prisoners, Sir Henry Elliot is somewhat
unjust to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r in his commentary at p. 515. It was only
those who had been <i>long</i> imprisoned whom Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
released, and his proceedings at Ranthambhor in the 13th year
(T&#363;zuk, p. 256) show that he exercised discrimination in releasing
prisoners. The account in Price, p. 10, may also be consulted. There
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r says he released 7,000 men from Gwalior alone. It
may be remembered that most of these were political offenders. Private
criminals were for the most part put to death, or mutilated, or fined.

first letter of the word, that is, alif, which stands for one

S&#863;har&#299;f K&#863;h&#257;n had been sent by Akbar to recall
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r to his duty, but instead of coming back he stayed
on. He did not accompany Jah&#257;ng&#299;r when the latter went off
the second time to wait upon his father. Probably he was afraid to do
so. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r appointed him to Bihar before he left Allahabad
to visit his father for the second time. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r says
S&#863;har&#299;f waited upon him fifteen days after his accession, and
on 4th Rajab. This is another proof, if proof were needed, that the

&ldquo;To have always in readiness in the arsenal arms, and

<i>&#299;lch&#299;</i>, which commonly means an ambassador&mdash;an

<i>ul&#363;s-i-Dihli</i>. Blochmann (p. 482 n.) points out that this is
a very doubtful term, as M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Al&#299; came from
Badakhshan. On examining three MSS. of the
T&#363;zuk-i-Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; I find no word <i>Dihli</i>, but
the words <i>&#299;n ul&#363;s</i>, &lsquo;this tribe or family,&rsquo;
and I think this must be the correct reading, and refers to the
Timurides. The same phrase occurs at text, p. 173. Blochmann suggests
to read <i>D&#363;ld&#257;y</i> for <i>Dihli</i>, but I think it more
probable that the word <i>Dihli</i> should be
<i>&#703;&#257;l&#299;</i>. M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Al&#299; was styled
<i>Akbars&#863;h&#257;h&#299;</i>, and no doubt this is why
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r writes <i>&#299;n ul&#363;s</i> or
<i>ul&#363;s-i-&#703;&#257;l&#299;</i>. M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Al&#299;
is often mentioned in the Akbarn&#257;ma in connection with the wars in
the Deccan, and is generally called Akbars&#863;h&#257;h&#299;, e.g. at
p. 702. For an account of his pathetic death see Blochmann, l.c., the

Catholic priests before Jah&#257;ng&#299;r (see J.A.S.B. for 1896, p.

Naq&#299;b&rsquo;s father, &#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f, with whom
Akbar read (see Akbarn&#257;ma, ii, 19). &#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f
and his family arrived in 963 (1556). Erskine understands
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s remark to mean that Naq&#299;b was his
(Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s) teacher, but probably Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
means that it was Naq&#299;b&rsquo;s father who taught Akbar, or he has
confounded the father and son. As Naq&#299;b lived till 1023 (1614), he
would probably be too young in 1556 to have been Akbar&rsquo;s
teacher.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd24e1939src">&uarr;</a></p>

Something seems to have fallen out of the text and MSS., for this
passage is obscure and not connected with the context. It is clearer in
Price&rsquo;s version, where it is brought in as part of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s statements about promotions, and where (p.
40) we read as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I shall now return to the more
grateful subject of recording rewards and advancements.... On
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Zakariyy&#257;, the son of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Muh&#803;ammad Yah&#803;y&#257;, although in disgrace, I conferred the
rank of 500. This I was induced to do on the recommendation of the
venerated S&#863;haik&#863;h H&#803;usain J&#257;m&#299;. Six months
previous to my accession,&rdquo; etc. Evidently the statement about
Zakariyy&#257;&rsquo;s promotion has been omitted accidentally from the
T&#363;zuk. There is a reference to the S&#863;haik&#863;h&rsquo;s
dream in Muh&#803;ammad H&#257;d&#299;&rsquo;s preface to the
T&#363;zuk (p. 15). He says there that it was the saint
Bah&#257;&#702;u-l-h&#803;aqq who appeared in a dream to H&#803;usain

excellent servant in his own line, he was hardly fit for the command of
2,000 or for the title of K&#863;h&#257;n. Cf. his praise of him at p.
71 (Blochmann, p. 498). He was called P&#299;s&#863;hrau probably from
his going on ahead with the advance camp, as being in charge of the

<h2 class="main">Feast of the Second New Year.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On Wednesday the 22nd Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da,
1015 (10th March, 1607), when 3&frac12; gharis of the day had passed,
the sun rose to his House of Honour. They decorated the palace after
the usual fashion: a great entertainment was prepared, and having
seated myself at an auspicious hour on the throne of accession I
exalted the nobles and courtiers with kindness and favour. On this same
auspicious day it was learned from the reports sent from Qandahar that
the army sent under M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;, son of
M&#299;rz&#257; J&#257;n&#299;, to succour (which had been appointed to
assist) S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, had entered the city of
Qandahar on the 12th of Shaww&#257;l. When the Persians heard of the
arrival of the victorious army at the last stage before the aforesaid
city,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3045src" href="#xd24e3045" name=
"xd24e3045src">1</a> they became surprised and wretched and repentant,
and did not draw rein until they had reached the Helmand, fifty or
sixty kos distant.</p>
<p class="par">In the second place it became known that the governor of
Far&#257;h and a number of the officers of that neighbourhood had taken
it into their heads, after the death of the late king, that in this
confusion Qandahar might easily fall into their hands, and without
waiting for an order from S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s had
collected together and won over the Chief of Sewist&#257;n
(S&#299;st&#257;n). Sending someone to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>H&#803;usain
K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of Herat they asked for support from him.
He also sent a force. After that they turned to attack Qandahar.
S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of that place, seeing
that battle has two heads, and that if (which God forbid!) he should be
defeated he would lose possession of Qandahar, thought that to confine
himself in a fort would be better than to fight. He therefore
determined to hold the fort, and sent quick messengers to the Court. It
happened that at this time the royal standards had started from Agra in
pursuit of K&#863;husrau, and had arrived at Lahore. Immediately on
hearing this news (from S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n), a large
force was sent off of amirs and mansabdars under M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;. Before the M&#299;rz&#257; reached Qandahar the
news had been carried to the S&#863;h&#257;h (of Persia) that the
governor of Far&#257;h, with some of the jagirdars of that
neighbourhood, had proceeded towards the province of Qandahar.
Considering this an improper proceeding, he sent H&#803;usain Beg, a
well-known man and one of his own intimates to make enquiries. He also
sent a farman in their names that they should move away from the
vicinity of Qandahar and go to their own places and abodes, because the
friendship and amity of his ancestors with the dignified family of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h were of old standing. That
body, before the arrival of H&#803;usain Beg and the King&rsquo;s
order, not being able to oppose the royal army, considered the
opportunity of returning a favourable one. The said H&#803;usain Beg
censured the men and started off to wait on me, which he had the honour
to do at Lahore. He explained that the ill-fated army which had
attacked Qandahar had acted without the order of S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;Abb&#257;s. God forbid (he said) that in consequence of this any
unpleasantness should remain in my mind. In short, after the victorious
troops reached Qandahar, they, according to orders, delivered the fort
over to Sard&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, and S&#863;h&#257;h Beg
K&#863;h&#257;n returned to Court with the relieving force.

<p class="par">On the 27th Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da, &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n, having brought R&#257;m Chand Band&#299;lah into
captivity and chains, brought him before me. I ordered them to take the
fetters from his legs, and bestowed on him a robe of honour, and handed
him over to R&#257;ja B&#257;so that he might take security and release
him and a number of his relations who had been captured with him. This
through my clemency and kindness came to pass. He had never imagined
such clemency and kindness as I showed to him.</p>
<p class="par">On the 2nd Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja I gave my son
K&#863;hurram a <i>t&#363;m&#257;n u t&#363;g&#863;h</i>, a flag and
drums, and bestowed on him the rank of 8,000 personal and 5,000 horse,
and gave an order for a jagir. On the same day, having exalted P&#299;r
K&#863;h&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3062src" href="#xd24e3062"
name="xd24e3062src">2</a> son of Daulat K&#863;h&#257;n Lod&#299;, who
had come from K&#863;handesh with the children of D&#257;niy&#257;l,
with the title of &#7778;al&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n and honoured him
with the rank of 3,000 personal and 1,500 horse, and presented him with
a standard and drums, I promoted him to the distinction of sonship
(<i>farzand&#299;</i>) beyond his fellows and equals. The ancestors and
uncles of &#7778;al&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s grandfather had
been great and honourable among the tribe of Lod&#299;. An earlier
Daulat K&#863;h&#257;n, uncle of &#7778;al&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s grandfather, when Ibr&#257;h&#299;m after his
father Sikandar&rsquo;s death, began to behave ill to his
father&rsquo;s amirs and destroyed many, became apprehensive, and sent
his younger son, Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n, to wait upon H.M.
B&#257;bar in Kabul, and suggested to him the acquisition of Hindustan.
As B&#257;bar also had this enterprise in mind, he at once proceeded in
that direction, and did not turn his rein till he reached the
neighbourhood of Lahore. Daulat K&#863;h&#257;n with his followers
obtained the good fortune to wait upon him, and performed loyal
service. As he was an old man, adorned with inward and outward
excellencies, he did much good service. He (B&#257;bar) generally
called him &ldquo;father,&rdquo; and entrusting to him as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=

"#xd24e3070" name="xd24e3070src">3</a> the government of the Panjab
placed its amirs and jagirdars under his jurisdiction. Taking
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n with him he (B&#257;bar) returned to
Kabul. When he (B&#257;bar) came a second time into the Panjab with
intent to invade Hindustan, Daulat K&#863;h&#257;n waited on him, and
about the same time died. Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n was honoured
with the title of K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n and was with
B&#257;bar in the battle he had with Ibr&#257;h&#299;m. In the same way
he was permanently in waiting on the late king Hum&#257;y&#363;n. In
the <i>th&#257;n&#257;</i> of Mungir, at the time of his
(Hum&#257;y&#363;n&rsquo;s) return from Bengal, he fought bravely
against S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n Afg&#863;h&#257;n, and was made
prisoner on the field of battle. Although S&#863;h&#299;r
K&#863;h&#257;n urged him to take service with him, he refused and
said, &ldquo;Thy ancestors were always the servants of mine: how, then,
could I do this?&rdquo; S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n was enraged,
and ordered him to be shut up in a wall.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3080src" href="#xd24e3080" name="xd24e3080src">4</a></p>
<p class="par">&#703;Umar K&#863;h&#257;n, the grandfather of
Sal&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n Farzand, who was cousin of Dil&#257;war
K&#863;h&#257;n, had been treated with respect in the time of
Sal&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n. After Sal&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s
death and the slaughter of F&#299;r&#363;z, his son, at the hand of
Muh&#803;ammad K&#863;h&#257;n, &#703;Umar K&#863;h&#257;n and his
brethren became suspicious of Muh&#803;ammad K&#863;h&#257;n and went
to Gujarat, where &#703;Umar K&#863;h&#257;n died. Daulat
K&#863;h&#257;n, his son, who was a brave young man of pleasant
appearance, and good at all things, chose the companionship of
&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m, son of Bair&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n, who
had been dignified with the title of
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n in the reign of Akbar, and
performed excellent service. The K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n
regarded him as his own brother, or even a thousand times better than
his brother, and dearer. Most of the
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n&rsquo;s victories were gained
through Daulat K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s valour and manliness.<a class=

When my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>revered father, having taken the province of
Khandesh and the fort of &#256;s&#299;r, returned to Agra, he left
D&#257;niy&#257;l in charge of that province and of all the provinces
acquired from the rulers of the Deccan. At this time D&#257;niy&#257;l
had separated Daulat K&#863;h&#257;n from the
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, and was keeping him in
attendance on himself and handing over to him for disposal all the
business of the State. He showed him much favour and perfect affection
until he died in his service. He left two sons, one Muh&#803;ammad
K&#863;h&#257;n, and the other P&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n; Muh&#803;ammad
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was the elder, died a short time after his father.
D&#257;niy&#257;l, too, wore himself out with drinking. After my
accession I summoned P&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n to Court. As I discovered
in him a good disposition and natural abilities, I raised the pedestal
of regard for him to the point that has been described. To-day there is
not in my government any person of greater influence than he, so much
so that on his representation I pass over faults which are not pardoned
at the intercession of any of the other servants of the Court. In
short, he is a young man of good disposition, brave, and worthy of
favour, and what I have done for him has been done rightly, and he will
be exalted by further favours.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3090src"
href="#xd24e3090" name="xd24e3090src">6</a></p>
<p class="par">As I had made up my exalted mind to the conquest of
M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr (Transoxiana), which was the hereditary
kingdom of my ancestors, I desired to free the face of Hindustan from
the rubbish of the factious and rebellious, and leaving one of my sons
in that country, to go myself with a valiant army in due array, with
elephants of mountainous dignity and of lightning speed, and taking
ample treasure with me, to undertake the conquest of my ancestral
dominions. In accordance with this idea, I despatched Parw&#299;z to
drive back the R&#257;n&#257;, and intended to go myself to the Deccan,
when just at that moment the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href=
"#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>improper action of K&#863;husrau took
place, and it became necessary to pursue him and put an end to that
disturbance. For the same reason, the undertaking of Parw&#299;z did
not assume a promising appearance, and regarding the exigency of the
time he gave a respite to the R&#257;n&#257;. Bringing with him one of
the R&#257;n&#257;&rsquo;s sons, he came to wait on me, and had the
bliss of attending me in Lahore. When I was at ease about
K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s disturbance, and the repulse of the
Qizilb&#257;shes, who had invested Qandahar, had been brought about in
a facile way, it came into my mind to make a hunting tour to Kabul,
which is like my native land. After that I would return to Hindustan,
when the purposes of my mind would pass from design to action. In
pursuance of these steps, on the 7th Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja, at an
auspicious hour, I left the fort of Lahore and took up my quarters in
the Dil-&#257;m&#299;z Garden, which is on the other side of the Ravi,
and stayed there four days. Sunday, the 19th Farward&#299;n, which is
the culmination of His Majesty the Sun, I passed in the garden, and
some of the servants of the Court were favourably and kindly honoured
with increased rank. Ten thousand rupees were bestowed on Hasan Beg,
the envoy of the ruler of Persia (S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s).
Leaving Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, M&#299;r&#257;n &#7778;adr
Jah&#257;n, and M&#299;r S&#863;har&#299;f &#256;mul&#299; in Lahore, I
ordered them to settle in consultation any matters that might present
themselves. On Monday I marched from the garden mentioned, and encamped
at the village of Harhar, 3&frac12; kos distant from the city. On
Tuesday the royal standards alighted at Jah&#257;ng&#299;rp&#363;r,
which is one of my fixed hunting-places. In this neighbourhood had been
erected by my order a <i>man&#257;r</i> at the head of the grave of an
antelope called Mansar&#257;j,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3100src"
href="#xd24e3100" name="xd24e3100src">7</a> which was without equal in
fights with tame <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>antelopes and in hunting wild ones. On a stone of
that manar was carved this prose composition, written by Mull&#257;
Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain of Kashmir, who was the chief of the
elegant writers of the day: &ldquo;In this enchanting place an antelope
came into the world-holding (<i>jah&#257;n-g&#299;r&#299;</i>) net of
the God-knowing ruler N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h. In the space of one month, having overcome his
desert fierceness, he became the head of the special antelopes.&rdquo;
On account of the rare quality of this antelope, I commanded that no
person should hunt the deer of this plain, and that their flesh should
be to Hindus and Muhammadans as is the flesh of cows and pigs. They
made the gravestone in the shape of an antelope. I ordered Sikandar
Mu&#703;&#299;n, the jagirdar of the aforesaid pargana, to build a
strong fort in the village of Jahangirpur.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 14th, I encamped in the pargana of
Chand&#257;la.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3113src" href="#xd24e3113"
name="xd24e3113src">8</a> Thence on Saturday, the 16th, making one
stage in the middle, I came to
H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804;&#257;b&#257;d.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3116src" href="#xd24e3116" name="xd24e3116src">9</a> I stayed in
the station which had been erected by the exertions of the
<i>karor&#299;</i> of that place, M&#299;r Qiy&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n.
Having reached the Chen&#257;b in two marches on Thursday, the 21st
Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja, I crossed the river by a bridge which had
been built there and my camp was pitched in the neighbourhood of the
pargana of Gujrat. At the time when His Majesty Akbar went to Kashmir,
a fort had been built on that bank of the river. Having brought to this
fort a body of Gujars who had passed their time in the neighbourhood in
thieving and highway robbery, he established them here. As it had
become the abode of Gujars, he made it a separate pargana, and gave it
the name of Gujrat. They call Gujars a caste which does little manual
work and subsists on milk and curds. On Friday I pitched at
K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779;p&#363;r, five kos from Gujrat, founded
by K&#863;haw&#257;ss <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92"
name="pb92">92</a>]</span>K&#863;h&#257;n, a slave of S&#863;h&#299;r
K&#863;h&#257;n Afg&#863;h&#257;n. Thence, with two halts in the
middle, I pitched on the bank of the Biha&#7789; (Jhelam). On that
night a great wind blew and a black cloud hid the face of the sky. The
rain was of such violence that old men remembered none such. It turned
to hail, and every hailstone was the size of a hen&rsquo;s egg. From
the flooding of the river and the force of the wind and rain, the
bridge broke. I, with the inmates of the harem, crossed in a boat. As
there were few boats, I ordered the men not<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3124src" href="#xd24e3124" name="xd24e3124src">10</a> to cross in
these, but to rebuild the bridge. It was finished in a week, and the
whole army crossed with ease. The source of the Biha&#7789; is a spring
in Kashmir called the V&#299;r-n&#257;g; in the language of India a
snake is <i>v&#299;r-n&#257;g</i>. Clearly there had been a large snake
at that place. I went twice to the spring in my father&rsquo;s
lifetime; it is 20 kos from the city of Kashmir. It is an octagonal
reservoir about 20 yards by 20. Near it are the remains of a place of
worship for recluses; cells cut out of the rock and numerous caves. The
water is exceedingly pure. Although I could not guess its depth, a
grain of poppy-seed is visible until it touches the bottom. There were
many fish to be seen in it. As I had heard that it was unfathomable, I
ordered them to throw in a cord with a stone attached, and when this
cord was measured in <i>gaz</i> it became evident that the depth was
not more than once and a half the height of a man. After my accession I
ordered them to build the sides of the spring round with stone, and
they made a garden round it with a canal; and built halls and houses
about it, and made a place such that travellers over the world can
point out few like it. When the river reaches the village of
P&#257;mp&#363;r, at a distance of ten kos from the city, it increases,
and all the saffron of Kashmir is obtained in this village. I do not
know if there is so much saffron in any other place in the world.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>The annual crop is 500 maunds by Hindustan weight,
equal to 5,000 <i>wil&#257;yat</i> (Persian) maunds. In attendance on
my revered father, I went to this place at the season when the saffron
was in flower. On other plants of the world, first the branches (stems)
shoot out and then the leaves and flowers. On the contrary, when the
saffron stem is four fingers breadth from the dry ground, its flowers
shoot out, of the colour of the iris,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3139src" href="#xd24e3139" name="xd24e3139src">11</a> with four
petals, and in the middle are four threads (<i>r&#299;s&#863;ha</i>) of
an orange colour like that of the flower, and of the length of a
finger-joint. This is the saffron. The land is not ploughed<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3149src" href="#xd24e3149" name=
"xd24e3149src">12</a> or irrigated, the plant springs up amongst the
clods. In some places its cultivation extends for a kos, and in others
for half a kos. It looks better from a distance. At the time of
plucking, all my attendants got headache from its sharp scent. Though I
drank wine and took a cup, I too got headache. I asked the animal-like
Kashmiris, who were employed in picking the flowers how they felt. I
ascertained that they had never experienced headache in their
lives.</p>
<p class="par">The waters from the spring V&#299;r-n&#257;g and of
other streams and nullahs that join from right and left form the river
Bihat, which passes through the heart of the city. Its breadth in most
places is not more than a bowshot.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3160src"
href="#xd24e3160" name="xd24e3160src">13</a> No one drinks its water,
because of its heaviness and indigestibility. All the people of Kashmir
drink the water of a lake that is near the city, and is called Dall.
The river Bihat enters this lake and flows through to the Panjab by the
B&#257;r&#257;m&#363;la Pass, Pakl&#299;, and Dant&#363;r. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In Kashmir there is plenty of water from streams and
springs. By far the best is that of the L&#257;r valley, which joins
the Bihat in the village of S&#863;hih&#257;bu-d-d&#299;n-p&#363;r.
This village is one of the celebrated places of Kashmir, and is on the
Bihat. About a hundred plane-trees (<i>chan&#257;r</i>) of graceful
form clustered<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3171src" href="#xd24e3171"
name="xd24e3171src">14</a> together on one plot of ground, pleasant and
green, join each other so as to shade the whole plot, and the whole
surface of the ground is grass and trefoil<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3174src" href="#xd24e3174" name="xd24e3174src">15</a>; so much so
that to lay a carpet on it would be superfluous and in bad taste. The
village was founded by Sult&#804;&#257;n
Zainu-l-&#703;&#257;bid&#299;n, who for 52 years ruled Kashmir with
absolute sway. They speak of him as the great P&#257;dsh&#257;h. They
tell many strange customs of his. There are many remains and traces of
buildings of his in Kashmir. One of these is in the midst of a lake
called Wul&#363;r, and of which the length and breadth are more than
three or four kos. It is called Zain-lank&#257;, and in making it they
have exerted themselves greatly. The springs of this lake are very
deep. The first time they brought a large quantity of stone in boats
and poured it on the place where now the building stands it had no
result. At last they sank some thousands of boats with stones, and with
great labour recovered a piece of ground 100 gaz by 100 gaz out of the
water, and made a terrace, and on one side thereof the Sultan erected a
temple for the worship of his supreme God. Than this there is no finer
place.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3188src" href="#xd24e3188" name=
"xd24e3188src">16</a> He often came to the spot by boat and engaged in
worship of the King of Wisdom. They say he spent many &ldquo;forty
days&rdquo; in that place. One day a wicked son of his came to that
place to kill him, and finding him alone, drew a sword and went in.
When his eye fell on the Sultan, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95"
href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>however, on account of his
venerable dignity and the might of his virtues, he became confused and
bewildered and turned away. The Sultan shortly after came out and
seated himself in the boat with this same son, and started for the
city. On the way he said to his son, &ldquo;I have forgotten my rosary;
get into a canoe and fetch it for me.&rdquo; The son having gone into
the temple sees his father in the same place, and the graceless man
with complete shame of face falls at his father&rsquo;s feet and asks
pardon for his fault. They have told many tales of such miracles as
this of him, and they say also that he had well practised the science
of <i>k&#863;hala&#703;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3203src" href=
"#xd24e3203" name="xd24e3203src">17</a> When, from the ways and methods
of his sons, he perceived in them signs of haste in seeking for rule
and government, he would say to them, &ldquo;To me it is very easy to
abandon rule, and even to pass away from life, but when I am gone you
will do nothing and the time of your prosperity will not endure long,
but in a short time you will obtain the recompense of your evil deeds
and your own dispositions.&rdquo; Having spoken thus, he gave up eating
and drinking, and passed forty days in this manner. He made not his eye
acquainted with sleep, and employed himself after the manner of men of
piety and austerity in the worship of God Almighty. On the fortieth day
he gave up the deposit of his existence, and entered into the mercy of
God. He left three sons&mdash;&#256;dam K&#863;h&#257;n,
H&#803;&#257;j&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, and Bahr&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n.
They quarrelled with each other, and all three were ruined. The
government of Kashmir was transferred to the tribe of the Chaks, who
belonged to the class of the common soldiers of the country. During
their dynasty three of the rulers constructed buildings on three sides
of the terrace formed by Zainu-l-&#703;&#257;bid&#299;n in the Wulur
Lake, but none of these is as strong as his. <span class=

<p class="par">Autumn and Spring in Kashmir are things worthy to be
seen. I witnessed the Autumn season, and it appeared to me to be better
than what I had heard of it. I have never seen Spring in that province,
but hope to do so some day. On Saturday the 1st of Muh&#803;arram (18th
April, 1607) I left the bank of the Bihat, and with one day between
reached the fort of Roht&#257;s, which was built by S&#863;h&#299;r
K&#863;h&#257;n Afg&#863;h&#257;n. This fort was founded in a cleft of
the ground, and the strength of it cannot be imagined. As the place is
near the Ghakhar territory, and they are a proud and rebellious people,
he had looked to this fort specially as a means of punishing and
defeating them. When a little of the building had been done
S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n died and his son, Sal&#299;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, obtained the grace to complete it. On each of the
gates<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3211src" href="#xd24e3211" name=
"xd24e3211src">18</a> they have carved on a stone the cost of erecting
the fort; 16 krors, 10 lakhs of dams, and more were expended, equal in
Hindustan reckoning to 4,025,000 rupees, and according to the currency
of Iran to 120,000 <i>t&#363;man</i>, and in the currency of Turan to 1
<i>arb</i>, 21 lakhs and 75,000 <i>k&#863;h&#257;n&#299;</i>, that are
now current.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3223src" href="#xd24e3223"
name="xd24e3223src">19</a></p>
<p class="par">On Tuesday the 4th of the month, having travelled four
kos and three-quarters, I encamped at T&#299;la.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3229src" href="#xd24e3229" name="xd24e3229src">20</a> Thence I
came down to the village of Bhakra. In the Ghakhar <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>tongue
<i>bhakra</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e3236src" href="#xd24e3236"
name="xd24e3236src">21</a> is a jungle. The jungle was composed of
clusters of flowers, white and scentless. I came the whole way from
T&#299;la to Bhakra in the middle of the river-bed,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e3245src" href="#xd24e3245" name="xd24e3245src">22</a> which
had running water in it, with oleander flowers of the colour of
peach-blossom. In Hindustan this plant is always in full bloom
(<i>purb&#257;r</i>). There was much of it on the banks of this river.
The horsemen and men on foot who were with me were told to put bunches
of the flower on their heads, and whoever did not do so had his turban
taken off; a wonderful flower-bed was produced.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday the 6th of the month the halting-place was
at Haty&#257;. On this road many pal&#257;s-trees (<i>Butea
frondosa</i>) were in blossom. This flower, too, is peculiar to the
jungles of Hindustan; it has no scent, but its colour is flaming
orange. The base of the flower is black; the flower itself is as big as
a red rose. It is so beautiful that one cannot take one&rsquo;s eyes
off it. As the air was very sweet and clouds had hidden the sun, and
rain was gently sprinkled about, I felt an inclination to drink wine.
In short this road was traversed with great enjoyment and pleasure.
They call the place Haty&#257; because it was founded by a Ghakkar
named H&#257;thi (elephant). From M&#257;rgala to Haty&#257; the
country is called Poth&#363;w&#257;r.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3264src" href="#xd24e3264" name="xd24e3264src">23</a> In these
regions there are few crows. From Roht&#257;s to Haty&#257; is the
place and abode of the Bh&#363;gy&#257;ls,<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">Marching on Friday the 7th, I travelled 4&frac12; kos
and alighted at the station of Pakka.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3272src" href="#xd24e3272" name="xd24e3272src">25</a> This place
is called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>Pakka because the <i>sar&#257;y</i> is of burnt
brick, and in the Hindi language what is ripe (that is, not raw
material) is called <i>pakka</i>. The station was strangely full of
dust and earth. The carts reached it with great difficulty owing to the
badness of the road. They had brought from Kabul to this place
<i>r&#299;w&#257;j</i> (rhubarb), which was mostly spoiled.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday the 8th we marched 4&frac12; kos and
encamped at the village of Khar.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3288src"
href="#xd24e3288" name="xd24e3288src">26</a> <i>Khar</i> in the Ghakkar
language is a rent and breakage. There are few trees in this country.
On Sunday the 9th I halted beyond R&#257;walpind&#299;. This place was
founded by a Hindu named R&#257;wal, and <i>pind&#299;</i> in the
Ghakkar tongue means a village. In the valley near this station there
was a stream flowing, the waters of which were collected in a pool. As
this halting-place was not devoid of freshness I alighted there for a
time, and I asked the Ghakkars the depth of the pool. They gave me no
precise answer, but said they had heard from their fathers that there
were alligators in the pool which wounded animals that came there, and
on that account no one had the boldness to go in. I ordered them to
throw in a sheep. It swam across the pool and came out. I then ordered
a <i>farr&#257;s&#863;h</i> to go in, and he also came out safe. It
thus became clear that there was no foundation for what the Ghakkars
had said. The pool was an arrow&rsquo;s flight in width.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday the 10th the village of
K&#863;harb&#363;za<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3302src" href=
"#xd24e3302" name="xd24e3302src">27</a> was our stage. The Ghakkars in
earlier times had built a dome here and taken tolls from travellers. As
the dome was shaped like a melon it became known by that name. On
Tuesday the 11th I halted at K&#257;la-p&#257;n&#299;, which in Hindi
means black water. There is a mountain pass (<i>kotal</i>) at this
place called M&#257;rgalla; in Hindi <i>m&#257;r</i> means <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>to beat
and <i>galla</i> is a caravan, the name therefore means the place of
the plundering of the caravan. The boundary of the Ghakkar country is
here. This tribe are wonderfully like animals; they are always
squabbling and fighting with one another. Although I wished to put an
end to this fighting, I was unable to do so.</p>

<p class="par first">On Wednesday the 12th the camp was at
B&#257;b&#257; H&#803;asan Abd&#257;l. One kos to the east of this
station there is a waterfall over which the stream rushes with great
force. There is no fall like it on the way to Kabul. On the road to
Kashmir there are two or three like it.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">In the middle of the basin, in which is the source of
the stream, R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh has erected a small building.
There are many fish in the basin of the length of half a gaz and a
quarter gaz. I halted three days at this enchanting place, drinking
wine with those who were intimate with me and employing myself in
catching fish. Until now I had never thrown a <i>sufra</i> net, which
is a famous kind of net, and which in Hindi they call
<i>bhanwar</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e3334src" href="#xd24e3334"
name="xd24e3334src">30</a> <i>j&#257;l</i>. It is not easy to throw. I
threw it with my own hand and caught twelve fish, and putting pearls
into their noses,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3342src" href="#xd24e3342"
name="xd24e3342src">31</a> let them loose in the water. I enquired

from the story-tellers and from the inhabitants of the place, but no
one could tell me any particulars. The celebrated place at that station
is a spring which flows from the foot of a little hill, exceedingly
clear, sweet, and nice, as witness this couplet of Am&#299;r
K&#863;husrau:&mdash;</p>

Muh&#803;ammad K&#863;hw&#257;f&#299;, who was for long employed as
Vizier by my revered father, had made a platform and a reservoir there,
into which is led the water from the spring, and thence is used in
cultivation and in gardens. On the edge of this terrace he had built a
dome for his own burial. By chance his destiny was not there, and (the
bodies of) H&#803;ak&#299;m Ab&#363;-l-fath&#803; G&#299;l&#257;n&#299;
and his brother H&#803;ak&#299;m Hum&#257;m, who were close to the
person and had the complete confidence of my revered father, were
placed in that dome in accordance with his order.</p>
<p class="par">On the 15th the halt was at Amroh&#299;.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3358src" href="#xd24e3358" name=
"xd24e3358src">32</a> It is a wonderfully green place, in which no ups
and downs were visible. In this village and its neighbourhood there are
7,000 or 8,000 households of Khaturs and Dal&#257;z&#257;ks. All kinds
of mischief and oppression and highway robbery take place through this
tribe. I ordered the government of this region and Attock to be given
to Z&#804;afar K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Zain K&#863;h&#257;n Koka, and
that by the time of the return of the royal standards from Kabul they
should march all the Dal&#257;z&#257;ks to Lahore and capture the head
men of the Khaturs and keep them in prison. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 17th, a march was made, and, with one
stage in between, the royal standards alighted near the fort of Attock
on the bank of the river N&#299;l&#257;b (Indus). At this stage
Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n was promoted to the rank of 2,500. This
fort was built by the late king Akbar, and was completed by the labours
of K&#863;hw&#257;ja S&#863;hamsu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;hw&#257;f&#299;. It
is a strong fort. At this time the water of the N&#299;l&#257;b was
low,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3365src" href="#xd24e3365" name=
"xd24e3365src">33</a> and accordingly a bridge had been made with
eighteen boats, and the people crossed over easily. I left the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; at Attock on account of weakness of body and
illness. An order was given to the bakhshis that, as the province of
Kabul could not support a large army, they should only allow the
immediate attendants of the Court to cross the river, and until the
return of the royal standards the royal camp should remain at Attock.
On Wednesday, the 19th, with the princes and some of the private
servants, having mounted on to a raft (with inflated skins underneath),
and having crossed the river N&#299;l&#257;b safely, I alighted on the
bank of the river K&#257;ma. The K&#257;ma is a river that flows by the
<i>qa&#7779;ba</i> (fortified town) of Jal&#257;l&#257;b&#257;d. The
<i>j&#257;la</i> is a structure they make of bamboos and grass and
place underneath it skins full of air. In this province they call them
<i>s&#863;h&#257;l</i> (or <i>s&#257;l</i>). In rivers and streams in
which there are rocks they are safer than boats. 12,000 rupees were
given to M&#299;r S&#863;har&#299;f &#256;mul&#299; and to a number of
men, who had been appointed to perform services at Lahore, to divide
amongst the faqirs. An order was given to &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q
Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3383src" href=
"#xd24e3383" name="xd24e3383src">34</a> and to Bih&#257;r&#299;
D&#257;s, bakhshi of the Ahadis, to complete the force that had been
appointed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>to accompany Z&#804;afar K&#863;h&#257;n and
send them away. With one stage in between, the camp halted at the saray
of B&#257;ra. On the other side of the river K&#257;ma there is a fort
which Zain K&#863;h&#257;n Koka built at the time when he was appointed
to subjugate the Y&#363;sufza&#702;e Afghans, and called Naus&#863;hahr
(Newcastle). About 50,000 rupees were spent upon it. They say that
Hum&#257;y&#363;n used to hunt rhinoceros in this region. I also heard
from my father that he had twice or thrice witnessed such a hunt in the
company of his father. On Thursday, the 25th, I alighted at the saray
of Daulat&#257;b&#257;d. Ah&#803;mad Beg of Kabul, jagirdar of
Peshawar, with the Maliks of the Y&#363;sufza&#702;es and the
G&#863;horiya-khel, came and waited on me. As the service of
Ah&#803;mad Beg was not approved, I transferred him from that territory
(wil&#257;yat) and conferred it on S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n, the
Afghan. On Wednesday, the 26th, I encamped in the garden of Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, which he had made in the neighbourhood of Peshawar. I
walked round Ghorkhatr&#299;, which is the worshipping-place of the
jog&#299;s in this neighbourhood, with the idea that I might see some
faqirs from association with whom I might obtain grace. But that was
like looking for the ph&oelig;nix or the philosopher&rsquo;s stone. A
herd without any religious knowledge came to my view, from seeing whom
I derived nothing but obscurity of mind. On Thursday, the 27th, I
arrived at the halting-place of Jamr&#363;d, and on Friday, 28th, at
the K&#863;haibar Kotal (Khyber Pass) and encamped at &#703;Al&#299;
Masjid, and on Saturday I traversed the tortuous
(<i>m&#257;rp&#299;ch</i>, i.e. snake-twisting) Pass, and alighted at
G&#863;har&#299;b-k&#863;h&#257;na. At this stage Ab&#363;-l-q&#257;sim
Namak&#299;n, Jagirdar of Jal&#257;l&#257;b&#257;d, brought an apricot,
which was not inferior in beauty to good Kashmir apricots. At the stage
of Daka they brought from Kabul <i>g&#299;l&#257;s</i> (cherries),
which my revered father had entitled
<i>S&#863;h&#257;h-&#257;l&#363;</i>. As I was much inclined to eat
them, inasmuch as I had not (hitherto?) obtained them, I ate them with
great zest as a relish to wine. On Tuesday, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>2nd
&#7778;afar, I encamped at Bas&#257;wal, which is on the bank of the
river. On the other side of the river there is a mountain which has no
trees or grass on it, and on that account they call this mountain the
hill of B&#299;daulat (unfortunate). I heard from my father that in
mountains like this there are mines of gold. On the mountain of
&#256;la B&#363;gh&#257;n, at the time when my revered father went to
Kabul, I had had a <i>qamarg&#257;h</i> hunt, and killed
several<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3403src" href="#xd24e3403" name=
"xd24e3403src">35</a> red deer. As I had handed over the administration
of all civil affairs to the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257;, and his illness
increased greatly, and forgetfulness came over his faculties to such an
extent that what was settled in one hour he forgot in the next, and his
forgetfulness was increasing day by day, on Wednesday, the 3rd
&#7778;afar, I entrusted the duties of the viziership to
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, presenting him with a special robe of
honour, and inkstand and a jewelled pen. It was a remarkable
coincidence that twenty-eight years previously to this, at the same
halting-place, my revered father had promoted him<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3412src" href="#xd24e3412" name="xd24e3412src">36</a> to the rank
of M&#299;r Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; (chief paymaster). A ruby which
his brother<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3415src" href="#xd24e3415" name=
"xd24e3415src">37</a> Ab&#363;-l-q&#257;sim had bought for 40,000
rupees and sent him, he presented as an offering on obtaining the
viziership. He petitioned that K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan, who held the offices of bakhshi and the
<i>Q&#363;r</i>, etc., might go with him. Jal&#257;l&#257;b&#257;d was
transferred from Ab&#363;-l-q&#257;sim Namak&#299;n to Arab
K&#863;h&#257;n. A white rock was present in the river-bed; I ordered
them to carve it in the form of an elephant <span class=

cut upon its breast this hemistich, which agrees with the date of the
Hijra year: &ldquo;The white stone elephant of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h,&rdquo; that is, 1016.</p>
<p class="par">On the same day Kaly&#257;n, son of R&#257;ja
Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, came from Gujarat. Certain extraordinary
proceedings on the part of this rebellious rascal had been reported to
me. Amongst these was this. He had kept a <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e3431" title="Source: Musulm&#257;n">Musulman</span>
<i>l&#363;l&#299;</i> woman in his house, and for fear this affair
should become known had killed her father and mother and buried them in
his house. I ordered that he should be imprisoned until I could enquire
into his proceedings, and after ascertaining the truth I ordered first
that they should cut out his tongue and place him in perpetual
confinement, and that he should eat his food with dog-keepers and
outcasts. On Wednesday I encamped at Surk&#863;h&#257;b. Thence I
alighted at Jagdalak. At this stage I saw many
<i>ball&#363;t&#804;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e3439src" href=
"#xd24e3439" name="xd24e3439src">38</a>-trees (oak or chestnut), which
are the best wood for burning. Although this stage had neither passes
nor declivities there were plenty of rocks. On Friday, the 12th, I
encamped at &#256;b-i-b&#257;r&#299;k, and Saturday, the 13th, at
Y&#363;rt-i-p&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h. On Sunday, the 14th, I alighted at
K&#863;h&#363;rd K&#257;bul (little Kabul). At this stage I entrusted
the Chief Justiceship and Qaziship of the city of Kabul to
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; &#703;&#256;rif, son of Mull&#257; S&#257;diq
Halw&#257;&#702;&#299;. They brought some ripe
<i>s&#863;h&#257;h-&#257;l&#363;</i> (cherries) from the village of
Gulbah&#257;r to this place; of these I ate with much enjoyment nearly
a hundred. Daulat, the head of the village of Jigr&#299;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3451src" href="#xd24e3451" name=
"xd24e3451src">39</a>(?), brought some uncommon flowers, such as I had
never seen in my life. Thence I alighted at Bikr&#257;m&#299;. At this
place they brought to show me a piebald<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3458src" href="#xd24e3458" name="xd24e3458src">40</a> animal,
like the flying (i.e. jumping) mouse, which in the Hindi tongue they
call <i>galahr&#299;</i> (squirrel), and said that mice would not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>frequent any house in which this animal was. On
this account they call this animal the master of mice. As I had never
seen one before, I ordered my painters to draw a likeness of it. It is
larger than a mongoose. On the whole it is very like a civet cat.
Having appointed Ah&#803;mad Beg K&#863;h&#257;n to punish the Afghans
of Bangas&#863;h, I ordered &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q
Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299;, who was in Attock, to take 2,000,000 rupees
under the charge of Mohan D&#257;s, son of R&#257;ja
Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, with him, and divide it among the auxiliaries of
the aforesaid army. One thousand musketeers were also ordered to
accompany this army.</p>
<p class="par">S&#863;haik&#863;h &#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;m&#257;n, son
of S&#863;haik&#863;h Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l, was promoted to the rank
of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, and obtained the title of
Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n. 15,000 rupees were presented to &#703;Arab
K&#863;h&#257;n, and 20,000 rupees more for the repair of the fort of
Pes&#863;h Bul&#257;g&#863;h.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3468src" href=

K&#863;h&#257;n Afg&#863;h&#257;n. On Thursday, the 17th, from the
Mast&#257;n bridge as far as the S&#863;hahr-&#257;r&#257; garden,
which was the encamping place for the royal standards, scattering
rupees, half-rupees, and quarter-rupees to faqirs and indigent persons
on both sides of the road, I entered the aforesaid garden. It appeared
to be very green and fresh. As it was a Thursday I gave a wine
entertainment to my intimates, and on account of hilarity and
excitement ordered those who were of equal age to myself and had been
my playfellows to jump over the stream that flowed through the middle
of the garden and was about four gaz in width. Most of them could not
jump it, and fell on the bank or into the stream. Although I jumped it,
yet now that I was 40 years of age I could not jump it with the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>activity that I had shown in the presence of my
revered father when I was 30. On this day I perambulated seven of the
famous gardens of Kabul. I do not think that I ever walked so far
before.</p>
<p class="par">First of all I walked round the
S&#863;hahr-&#257;r&#257; (city-adorning), then the Maht&#257;b
(moonlight) garden, then the garden that B&#299;ka Begam, grandmother
of my father, had made, then passed through the
&#362;rta-b&#257;g&#863;h (middle garden), then a garden that
Maryam-mak&#257;n&#299;, my own grandmother, had prepared, then the
&#7778;&#363;rat-k&#863;h&#257;na garden, which has a large
<i>chan&#257;r</i>-tree, the like of which there is not in the other
gardens of Kabul. Then, having seen the Ch&#257;rb&#257;g&#863;h, which
is the largest of the city gardens, I returned to my own abode. There
were abundance of cherries on the trees, each of which looked as it
were a round ruby, hanging like globes on the branches. The
S&#863;hahr-&#257;r&#257; garden was made by
S&#863;hahr-b&#257;n&#363;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3483src" href=
"#xd24e3483" name="xd24e3483src">43</a> Begam, daughter of
M&#299;rz&#257; Ab&#363; Sa&#703;&#299;d, who was own aunt to the late
king B&#257;bar. From time to time it has been added to, and there is
not a garden like it for sweetness in Kabul. It has all sorts of fruits
and grapes, and its softness is such that to put one&rsquo;s
sandalled<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3486src" href="#xd24e3486" name=
"xd24e3486src">44</a> feet on it would be far from propriety or good
manners. In the neighbourhood of this garden an excellent plot of land
came to view, which I ordered to be bought from the owners. I ordered a
stream that flows from the <i>guz&#817;arg&#257;h</i> (ferry, also
bleaching green) to be diverted into the middle of the ground so that a
garden might be made such that in beauty and sweetness there should not
be in the inhabited world another like it. I gave it the name of
Jah&#257;n-&#257;r&#257; (world-adorning). Whilst I was at Kabul I had
several entertainments in the S&#863;hahr-&#257;r&#257; garden,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>sometimes with my intimates and courtiers and
sometimes with the ladies of the harem. At nights I ordered the learned
and the students of Kabul to hold the cooking entertainment,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3497src" href="#xd24e3497" name=
"xd24e3497src">45</a> <i>bug&#863;hra</i>, and the throwing of
bug&#863;hra, together with <i>arg&#863;hus&#863;htak</i> dances.</p>
<p class="par">To each of the band of
<i>Bug&#863;hr&#257;&#702;iy&#257;n</i> I gave a dress of honour, and
also gave 1,000 rupees to divide amongst themselves. To twelve of the
trustworthy courtiers I ordered 12,000 rupees to be given, to be
bestowed every Thursday, as long as I was in Kabul, on the poor and
needy. I gave an order that between two plane-trees that were on the
canal bank in the middle of the garden&mdash;to one of which I had
given the name of Far&#257;h&#803;-bak&#863;hs&#863;h (joy-giver) and
the other S&#257;ya-bak&#863;hs&#863;h (shade-giver)&mdash;they should
set up a piece of white stone (marble?) one gaz in length and
three-quarters of a gaz in breadth, and engrave my name thereon (and
those of my ancestors) up to T&#299;m&#363;r. It was set forth on the
other side that I had done away with the whole of the customs dues and
charges of Kabul, and whichever of my <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>descendants and
successors should do anything contrary to this would be involved in the
wrath and displeasure of God. Up to the time of my accession these were
fixed and settled, and every year they took large sums on this account
from the servants of God (the Muhammadan people in general). The
abolition of this oppression was brought about during my reign. On this
journey to Kabul complete relief and contentment were brought about in
the circumstances of my subjects and the people of that place. The good
and leading men of G&#863;hazn&#299;n and that neighbourhood were
presented with robes of honour and dealt kindly with, and had their
desires excellently gratified.</p>
<p class="par">It is a strange coincidence that (the words)
<i>r&#363;z-i-panjs&#863;hanba
h&#299;z&#863;hdaham-i-&#7778;afar</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3527src" href="#xd24e3527" name="xd24e3527src">46</a> Thursday,
18th &#7778;afar, which is the date of my entry into Kabul, give the
Hijra date thereof.</p>
<p class="par">I ordered them to inscribe this date on the stone. Near
a seat (<i>tak&#863;ht</i>) on the slope of a hill to the south of the
city of Kabul, and which is known as Tak&#863;ht-i-s&#863;h&#257;h,
they have made a stone terrace where Fird&#363;s-mak&#257;n&#299;
(B&#257;bar) used to sit and drink wine. In one corner of this rock
they have excavated a round basin which could contain about two
Hindustani maunds of wine. He caused his own blessed name with the date
to be carved on the wall of the terrace which is next to the hill. The
wording is, &ldquo;The seat of the king, the asylum of the world,
Z&#804;ah&#299;ru-d-d&#299;n Muh&#803;ammad B&#257;bar, son of
&#703;Umar S&#863;haik&#863;h G&#363;rg&#257;n, may God perpetuate his
kingdom, 914 (1508&ndash;9).&rdquo; I also ordered them to cut out of
stone another throne parallel <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109"
href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>to this, and dig another
basin of the same fashion on its side, and engrave my name there,
together with that of &#7778;&#257;h&#803;ib-qir&#257;n&#299;
(T&#299;m&#363;r). Every day that I sat on that throne I ordered them
to fill both of the basins with wine and give it to the servants who
were present there. One of the poets of Ghaznin found the date of my
coming to Kabul in this chronogram&mdash;&ldquo;The king of the cities
of the seven climes&rdquo; (1016). I gave him a dress of honour and a
present, and ordered them to engrave this date on the wall near the
aforesaid seat. Fifty thousand rupees were given to Parw&#299;z;
Waz&#299;r-al-mulk was made Mir Bakhshi. A firman was sent to
Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n to despatch 170,000 rupees from the Lahore
treasury for expenses of the army at Qandahar. After visiting the
K&#863;hiy&#257;b&#257;n (avenue) of Kabul and the B&#299;b&#299;
M&#257;h-r&#363;, I ordered the governor of that city to plant other
trees in the place of those cut down by H&#803;usain Beg
R&#363;-siy&#257;h (the black-faced). I also visited the
&#362;lang-y&#363;rt of Ch&#257;l&#257;k and found it a very pleasant
place. The Ra&rsquo;is of Chikr&#299; (Jigr&#299;?) shot with an arrow
a <i>rang</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e3558src" href="#xd24e3558"
name="xd24e3558src">47</a> and brought it to me. Up to this time I had
never seen a rang. It is like a mountain goat, and there is a
difference only in its horns. The horns of the rang are bent, and those
of the goat are straight and convoluted.</p>
<p class="par">In connection with the account of Kabul the commentaries
of B&#257;bar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3563src" href="#xd24e3563"
name="xd24e3563src">48</a> passed in view before me. These were in his
own handwriting, except four sections (<i>juz&#702;</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3568src" href="#xd24e3568" name=
"xd24e3568src">49</a>) that I wrote myself. At the end of the said
sections a sentence was written by me also in the Turk&#299; character,
so that it might be known that these four sections were written by me
in my own hand. Notwithstanding that I grew up in Hindustan, I am not
ignorant of Turk&#299; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href=
"#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>speech and writing.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3576src" href="#xd24e3576" name=
"xd24e3576src">50</a> On the 25th &#7778;afar I with the people of the
harem visited the <i>julg&#257;h</i> (plain) of Saf&#299;d-sang, a very
bright and enjoyable place. On Friday, the 26th, I enjoyed the blessing
of a pilgrimage to (the tomb of) H.M. Fird&#363;s-mak&#257;n&#299;
(B&#257;bar). I ordered much money and food, bread, and sweetmeats for
the souls of the departed to be distributed to faqirs. Ruqayya
Sult&#804;&#257;n Begam, daughter of M&#299;rz&#257; Hind&#257;l, had
not performed a pilgrimage to her father&rsquo;s tomb, and on that day
had the honour to do so. On Thursday, 3rd Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal, I
ordered them to bring my racehorses (<i>&#257;sp&#257;n-i-dawanda</i>)
to the K&#863;hiy&#257;b&#257;n (avenue). The princes and the Amirs
raced them. A bay Arab horse, which &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n,
the ruler of the Deccan, had sent to me, ran better than all the other
horses. At this time the son of M&#299;rz&#257; Sanjar Haz&#257;ra and
the son of M&#299;rz&#257; M&#257;s&#863;h&#299;, who were the chief
leaders of the Haz&#257;ras, came to wait on me. The Haz&#257;ras of
the village of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>M&#299;rd&#257;d produced before me two
rangs<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3597src" href="#xd24e3597" name=
"xd24e3597src">51</a> that they had killed with arrows. I had never
seen a rang of this size; it was larger by 20 per cent. than a large
<i>m&#257;rk&#863;h&#363;r</i> (?).</p>
<p class="par">News came that S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, the
governor of Qandahar, had reached the parganah of S&#863;hor,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3605src" href="#xd24e3605" name=
"xd24e3605src">52</a> which is his jagir. I determined to give Kabul to
him and return to Hindustan. A petition came from R&#257;ja
B&#299;rsing-deo that he had made a prisoner of his nephew, who had
been creating a disturbance and had killed many of his men. I ordered
him to send him to the fort of Gwalior to be imprisoned there. The
parganah of Gujr&#257;t<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3608src" href=
"#xd24e3608" name="xd24e3608src">53</a> in the Panjab Sark&#257;r I
bestowed on S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n, the Afghan. I promoted
Ch&#299;n Qil&#299;j, son of Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, to the rank of
800 personal and 500 horse. On the 12th I sent for K&#863;husrau and
ordered them to take the chains off his legs that he might walk in the
S&#863;hahr-&#257;r&#257; garden. My fatherly affection would not
permit me to exclude him from walking in the aforesaid garden. I
transferred the fort of Attock and that neighbourhood from Ah&#803;mad
Beg to Z&#804;afar K&#863;h&#257;n. To Taj K&#863;h&#257;n, who was
nominated to beat back the Afghans of Bangas&#863;h, I gave 50,000
rupees. On the 14th I gave &#703;Al&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n
Ka&#7771;or&#299;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3614src" href=
"#xd24e3614" name="xd24e3614src">54</a> who was one of my revered
father&rsquo;s old servants and was the <i>d&#257;rog&#863;ha</i> of
the Naq&#257;rak&#863;h&#257;na (drum-house), the title of Naubat
K&#863;h&#257;n, and promoted him to the rank of 500 personal and 200
horse. I made R&#257;m D&#257;s <i>&#257;t&#257;l&#299;q</i> to
Mah&#257; Singh, grandson of R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh, who had also
been nominated to drive back the rebels of Bangas&#863;h. On Friday,
the 18th, the <i>wazn-i-qamar&#299;</i> (the weighing according to the
lunar year) for my 40th year took place. On that day the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>assembly was held when two watches of the day
had passed. I gave 10,000 rupees of the money of the weighing to ten of
my confidential servants to divide amongst those who deserved it and
the needy. On this day a petition came from Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of Qandahar, by way of Haz&#257;ra and
G&#863;hazn&#299;n, in twelve days; its purport was that the ambassador
of S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s, who had started for the Court, had
entered the Haz&#257;ra<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3629src" href=
"#xd24e3629" name="xd24e3629src">55</a> (country). The Shah had written
to his own people: &ldquo;What seeker of occasion and raiser of strife
has come against Qandahar without my order? Perhaps he does not know
what is our connection with H.M. Sult&#804;&#257;n T&#299;m&#363;r, and
especially with Hum&#257;y&#363;n and his glorious descendants. If they
by chance should have taken the country into their possession they
should hand it to the friends and servants of my brother
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h and return to their own
abodes.&rdquo; I determined to tell S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n
to secure the Ghaznin road in such a way that travellers from Qandahar
might reach Kabul with ease. At the same time I appointed
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n to the &#7778;ad&#257;rat of
the province of Malwah and Ujjain. The son of M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;dm&#257;n Haz&#257;ra and grandson of Qar&#257;cha
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of the influential Amirs of
Hum&#257;y&#363;n, waited on me. Qar&#257;cha K&#863;h&#257;n had
married a woman from the Haz&#257;ra tribe, and this son<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3632src" href="#xd24e3632" name=

R&#257;n&#257; S&#863;hankar, son of R&#257;n&#257; &#362;day Singh,
was promoted to the rank of 2,500 personal and 1,000 horse. An order
was given for the rank of 1,000 personal and 600 horse for R&#257;y
Manohar. The S&#863;hinw&#257;r&#299; Afghans brought a mountain ram
the two horns of which had become one and had become like a
rang&rsquo;s horns. The same Afghans killed and brought <span class=

<i>m&#257;rk&#863;h&#363;r</i> (Erskine translates this &lsquo;a
serpent-eating goat&rsquo;), the like of which I had never seen or
imagined. I ordered my artists to paint him. He weighed four Hindustani
maunds; the length of his horns was 1&frac12; gaz.<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e3641src" href="#xd24e3641" name="xd24e3641src">57</a> On
Sunday, the 27th, I gave the rank of 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse to
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n, and the
<i>h&#803;aw&#299;l&#299;</i> (district surrounding) of Gwalior was
placed in the jagir of I&#703;tib&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n. I appointed
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; &#703;Izzatu-llah with his brothers to the
Bangas&#863;h duty. At the end of the same day a petition came to me
from Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n from Agra, together with a letter which
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n had written to him from
Bihar. Its purport was that on the 3rd &#7778;afar (30th May, 1607),
after the first watch, &#703;Al&#299; Qul&#299; Ist&#257;jl&#363; had
wounded Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n at Bardwan, in the
province of Bengal, and that he had died when two watches of the same
night had passed. The details of this matter are that the aforesaid
&#703;Al&#299; Qul&#299; was <i>sufrach&#299;</i> (table servant) to
S&#863;h&#257;h Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l (the 2nd), ruler of Iran; after
his death he took to flight through his natural wickedness and habit of
making mischief, and came to Qandahar, and having met at Multan the

(Akbar), and he having performed services in that campaign was promoted
to a rank in accordance with his condition, and was a long time in the
service of my revered father. At the time when he (Akbar) went in
prosperity to the provinces of the Deccan, and I was ordered against
the R&#257;n&#257;, he came and became servant to me. I gave him the
title of S&#863;h&#299;r-afgan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114"
href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>(tiger-throwing). When I came
from Allahabad to wait on my revered father, on account of the
unfriendliness that was shown me, most of my attendants and people were
scattered abroad, and he also at that time chose to leave my service.
After my accession, out of generosity I overlooked his offences, and
gave an order for a jagir for him in the Subah of Bengal. Thence came
news that it was not right to leave such mischievous persons there, and
an order went to Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n to send him to
Court, and if he showed any futile, seditious ideas, to punish him. The
aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n had reason to know him (his character), and
with the men he had present, immediately the order arrived, went
hastily to Bardwan, which was his jagir. When he
(S&#863;h&#299;r-afgan) became aware of the arrival of
Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n, he went out to receive him
alone with two grooms. After he arrived and entered into the midst of
his army (his camp) the aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n surrounded him. When
from this proceeding on the part of Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n
K&#863;h&#257;n a doubt arose in his mind, he by way of deceiving him
said: &ldquo;What proceeding is this of thine?&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e3664src" href="#xd24e3664" name="xd24e3664src">60</a> The
aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n, keeping back his own men, joined him alone
in order to explain the purport of the order to him. Seeing his
opportunity he immediately drew his sword and inflicted two or three
severe wounds upon him. Amba K&#863;h&#257;n Kas&#863;hm&#299;r&#299;,
who was descended from the rulers of Kashmir and was connected (by
marriage?) with the aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n, and had a great regard
for him by way of loyalty and manliness, rushed forward and struck a
heavy blow on &#703;Al&#299; Qul&#299;&rsquo;s head, and that vicious
fellow inflicted a severe wound on Amba K&#863;h&#257;n with the point
of his sword.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3673src" href="#xd24e3673"
name="xd24e3673src">61</a> When they saw Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n
K&#863;h&#257;n in this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href=
"#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>state, his men attacked him
(S&#863;h&#299;r-afgan), and cut him in pieces and sent him to hell. It
is to be hoped that the place of this black-faced scoundrel will always
be there. Amba K&#863;h&#257;n obtained martyrdom on the spot, and
Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n Koka after four watches attained
the mercy of God in his quarters. What can I write of this
unpleasantness? How grieved and troubled I became!
Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n Koka was to me in the place of a
dear son, a kind brother, and a congenial friend. What can one do with
the decrees of God? Bowing to destiny I adopted an attitude of
resignation. After the departure of the late King and the death of that
honoured one, no two misfortunes had happened to me like the death of
the mother of Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n Koka and his own
martyrdom.</p>
<p class="par">On Friday, the 6th Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-&#257;k&#863;hir,
I came to the quarters of K&#863;hurram (S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n),
which had been made in the &#362;rta Garden. In truth, the building is
a delightful and well-proportioned one. Whereas it was the rule of my
father to have himself weighed twice every year, (once) according to
the solar and (once according to the) lunar year, and to have the
princes weighed according to the solar year, and moreover in this year,
which was the commencement of my son K&#863;hurram&rsquo;s 16th lunar
year, the astrologers and astronomers<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3682src" href="#xd24e3682" name="xd24e3682src">62</a> represented
that a most important epoch according to his horoscope would occur, as
the prince&rsquo;s health<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3685src" href=
"#xd24e3685" name="xd24e3685src">63</a> had not been good, I gave an
order that they should weigh him according to the prescribed rule,
against gold, silver, and other metals, which should be divided among
faqirs and the needy. The whole of that day was passed in enjoyment and
pleasure in the house of B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram, and many of his
presents were approved. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href=

<p class="par">As I had experienced the excellencies of Kabul, and had
eaten most of its fruits, in consequence of important considerations
and the distance from the capital, on Sunday, the 4th
Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal, I gave an order that they should send out the
advance camp in the direction of Hindustan. After some days I left the
city, and the royal standards proceeded to the meadow of
Saf&#299;d-sang. Although the grapes were not yet fully ripe, I had
often before this eaten Kabul grapes. There are many good sorts of
grapes, especially the &#7778;&#257;h&#803;ib&#299; and
Kis&#863;hmis&#863;h&#299;. The cherry also is a fruit of pleasant
flavour, and one can eat more of it than of other fruits; I have in a
day eaten up to 150 of them. The term
<i>s&#863;h&#257;h-&#257;l&#363;</i> means
<i>g&#299;l&#257;s</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e3696src" href=
"#xd24e3696" name="xd24e3696src">64</a> (cherry), which are obtainable
in most places of the country, but since <i>g&#299;l&#257;s</i> is like
<i>g&#299;l&#257;s</i>, which is one of the names of the
<i>chalp&#257;sa</i> (lizard), my revered father called it
<i>s&#863;h&#257;h-&#257;l&#363;</i>. The <i>zard-&#257;l&#363;
paywand&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e3719src" href="#xd24e3719"
name="xd24e3719src">65</a> is good, and is abundant. There is
especially a tree in the S&#863;hahr-&#257;r&#257; garden, that
M&#299;rz&#257; Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;ak&#299;m, my uncle, planted, and
is known as the M&#299;rz&#257;&#702;&#299;. The apricots of this tree
are quite unlike the apricots of other trees. The peaches also are very
delicious and plentiful. They had brought some peaches from
Ist&#257;lif. I had them weighed in my presence, and they came exactly
in weight to 25 rupees, which is 68 current <i>mis&#804;q&#257;l</i>.
Notwithstanding the sweetness of the Kabul fruits, not one of them has,
to my taste, the flavour of the mango. The parganah of Mah&#257;ban was
given as jagir to Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n.
&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m, paymaster of the Ahadis, was promoted to
the rank of 700 personal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href=
"#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>and 200 horse. Mub&#257;rak
K&#863;h&#257;n Sarw&#257;n&#299; was appointed to the faujd&#257;rship
of the sarkar of H&#803;i&#7779;&#257;r. I ordered that M&#299;rz&#257;
Far&#299;d&#363;n Barl&#257;s should have a jagir in the Subah of
Allahabad. On the 14th of the aforesaid month I gave Ir&#257;dat
K&#863;h&#257;n, brother of &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, the rank
of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and presenting him with a special robe
of honour and a horse, bestowed on him the paymastership of the Subah
of Patna and H&#803;&#257;j&#299;p&#363;r. As he was my
<i>q&#363;rbeg&#299;</i>, I sent by his hand a jewelled sword for my
son (<i>farzand</i>) Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of the
aforesaid Subah. As we were going along I saw near &#703;Al&#299;
Masjid and G&#863;har&#299;b-k&#863;h&#257;na a large spider of the
size of a crab that had seized by the throat a snake of one and a half
gaz in length and half strangled it. I delayed a minute to look on at
this, and after a moment it died (the snake).</p>
<p class="par">I heard at Kabul that in the time of Mah&#803;m&#363;d
of Ghazni a person of the name of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
T&#257;b&#363;t<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3748src" href="#xd24e3748"
name="xd24e3748src">66</a> had died in the neighbourhood of
Z&#803;uh&#803;&#257;k and B&#257;miy&#257;n, and was buried in a cave,
whose limbs had not yet rotted asunder. This appeared very strange, and
I sent one of my confidential record writers with a surgeon to go to
the cave and, having seen the state of affairs as they were, to make a
special report. He represented that half of the body which was next the
ground had most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118"
name="pb118">118</a>]</span>of it come asunder, and the other half
which had not touched the ground remained in its own condition. The
nails of the hands and feet and the hair of the head had not been shed,
but the hair of the beard and moustache as far as one side of the nose
had been shed. From the date that had been engraved on the door of the
cave it appeared that his death had occurred before the time of
Sult&#804;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d. No one knows the exact state of
the case.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 15th Arsl&#257;n B&#299;, governor of
the fort of K&#257;hmard, who was one of the servants of middle rank
(?) of Wal&#299; Muh&#803;ammad K&#863;h&#257;n, ruler of
T&#363;r&#257;n, came and waited on me.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3755src" href="#xd24e3755" name="xd24e3755src">67</a> I had
always heard that M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;usain, son of
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h M&#299;rz&#257;, had been killed by the
&#362;zbegs. At this time a certain person came and presented a
petition in his name, and brought a ruby of the colour of an onion,
which was worth 100 rupees, as an offering. He prayed that an army
might be appointed to assist him, so that he might take Badakhshan out
of the &#362;zbegs&rsquo; hands. A jewelled dagger-belt was sent him,
and an order given that, as the royal standards had alighted in those
regions, if he really was M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;usain, son of
M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, he should first hasten into
my presence, so that having examined his petitions and claims I might
send him to Badakhshan. Two hundred thousand rupees were sent for the
army that had been sent with Mah&#257; Singh and R&#257;m D&#257;s
against the rebels of Bangash.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 22nd, having gone to the B&#257;l&#257;
H&#803;i&#7779;&#257;r, I inspected the buildings in that place. As the
place was not fit for me I ordered them to destroy these buildings and
to prepare a palace and a royal hall of audience. On the same day they
brought a peach from Ist&#257;lif, <i>bar&#257;bar sar-i-buh
bakal&#257;n&#299;</i>, &ldquo;as big as an owl&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>head&rdquo; (?).<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3765src" href="#xd24e3765" name="xd24e3765src">68</a> I had not
seen a peach of such a size, and ordered it to be weighed, and it came
to 63 Akbar&#299; rupees, or 60 tolas. When I cut it in half its stone
also came into two pieces, and its substance was sweet. I had in Kabul
never eaten better fruit from any tree. On the 25th news came from
Malwa that M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h had bid farewell
to this transitory world, and God Almighty had submerged him in His
mercy. From the day on which he entered the service of my revered
father till the time of his departure, from no act of his could dust be
brought into the royal mind. He always did his duty with sincerity. The
aforesaid M&#299;rz&#257; apparently had four sons: H&#803;asan and
H&#803;usain were born of the same womb (i.e. they were twins).
H&#803;usain fled from Burhanpur and went by sea to Iraq, and thence to
Badakhshan, where they say he now is, as has been written about his
message and his sending some one to me. No one knows for certain
whether it is the same M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;usain, or the people of
Badakhshan have raised up this one like other false M&#299;rz&#257;s
and given him the name of M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;usain. From the time
when M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h came from Badakhshan and
had the good fortune to wait on my father until now, nearly 25 years
have passed. For some time the people of Badakhshan, on account of the
oppression and injury they have to undergo from the &#362;zbegs, have
given notoriety to a Badakhshan boy, who had on his face the marks of
nobility, as really the son of M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h and of the race of M&#299;rz&#257;
Sulaim&#257;n. A large number of the scattered &#362;ym&#257;qs, and
the hill-people of Badakhshan, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120"
href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>whom they call G&#863;harchal
(Georgians?), collected round him, and showing enmity and disputing
with the &#362;zbegs, took some of the districts of Badakhshan out of
their possession. The &#362;zbegs attacked that false M&#299;rz&#257;
and captured him, and placing his head on a spear sent it round to the
whole country of Badakhshan. Again the seditious people of Badakhshan
quickly produced another M&#299;rz&#257;. Up to now several
M&#299;rz&#257;s have been killed. It appears to me that as long as
there is any trace of the people of Badakhshan they will keep up this
disturbance. The third son of the M&#299;rz&#257; is M&#299;rz&#257;
Sult&#804;&#257;n, who excels in appearance and disposition all the
other sons of the M&#299;rz&#257;. I begged him from his revered
father, and have kept him in my own service, and having taken great
pains with him reckon him as my own child. In disposition and manners
he has no likeness to his brothers. After my accession I gave him the
rank of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, and sent him to the Subah of
Malwa, which was his father&rsquo;s place. The fourth son is
Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, whom he always had in attendance on
himself; he obtained the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse.</p>
<p class="par">While I was at Kabul, no <i>qamarg&#257;h</i> hunt had
taken place. As the time for returning to Hindustan had come near, and
I was very desirous of hunting red deer, I ordered them to go forward
as soon as possible and surround the hill Faraq,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3784src" href="#xd24e3784" name="xd24e3784src">69</a> which is
seven kos from Kabul. On Tuesday, the 4th Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal, I
went to hunt. Nearly 100 deer had come into the enclosure (qamargah).
About a half of these were taken, and a very hot hunt took place. I
gave 5,000 rupees in rewards to the ryots who were present at the hunt.
On the same day an increase of 500 horse was ordered to the rank of
S&#863;haik&#863;h <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121"
name="pb121">121</a>]</span>&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;m&#257;n, son of
S&#863;haik&#863;h Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l, so as to bring it to 2,000
personal and (2,000) horse. On Thursday, the 6th, I went to the
throne-place of the late king B&#257;bar. As I was to leave Kabul on
the next day I looked on that day as a feast day, and ordered them to
arrange a wine-party on the spot, and fill with wine the little
reservoir they had cut in the rock. Cups were given to all the
courtiers and servants who were present, and few days have passed in
such enjoyment and pleasure. On Friday, the 7th, when a watch of day
had passed, leaving the city auspiciously and with pleasure, a halt was
made at the <i>julg&#257;h</i> (meadow) of the Saf&#299;d-sang. From
the S&#863;hahr-&#257;r&#257; as far as the julgah I scattered to
faqirs and poor people <i>darb</i> and <i>charan</i>, that is, half and
quarter rupees.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3799src" href="#xd24e3799"
name="xd24e3799src">70</a> On that day, when I mounted my elephant for
the purpose of leaving Kabul, the news arrived of the recovery of the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; and S&#863;h&#257;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n. The
news of the good health of these two chief servants of mine I took as
an auspicious omen for myself. From the julgah of the Saf&#299;d-sang,
marching one kos on Tuesday, the 11th, I halted at Bikr&#257;m. I left
T&#257;s&#863;h Beg K&#863;h&#257;n at Kabul to take proper care of
Kabul and neighbourhood until the coming of S&#863;h&#257;h Beg
K&#863;h&#257;n. On Tuesday, the 18th, I marched two and a half kos
from the halting-place of B&#363;tk&#863;h&#257;k by the road
D&#363;&#702;&#257;ba,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3802src" href=
"#xd24e3802" name="xd24e3802src">71</a> and encamped at a spring on the
bank of which there are four plane-trees. No one till now had looked to
the preparation of this halting-place, and they were ignorant of its
condition and suitability. It is in truth a most excellent spot, and
one fit to have a building erected in it. At this halting-place another
qamargah hunt took place, when about 112 deer, etc., were taken.
Twenty-four rang antelope and 50 red antelope and 16 mountain goats
were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>taken. I had never till now seen a rang antelope
alive.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3807src" href="#xd24e3807" name=
"xd24e3807src">72</a> It is in truth a wonderful animal of a beautiful
shape. Although the black buck of Hindustan looks very finely made, the
shape and fashion and appearance of this antelope is quite a different
thing. They weighed a ram and a rang; the ram came to a maund and 33
seers and the rang to two maunds and 10 seers. The rang, although of
this size, ran so that ten or twelve swift dogs were worn out and
seized it with a hundred thousand difficulties. The flesh of the sheep
of the Barbary goat in flavour does not surpass that of the rang. In
the same village kulangs (demoiselle crane) were also caught.</p>
<p class="par">Although K&#863;husrau had repeatedly done evil actions
and deserved a thousand kinds of punishment, my fatherly affection did
not permit me to take his life. Although in the laws of government and
the ways of empire one should take notice of such disapproved deeds, I
averted my eyes from his faults, and kept him in excessive comfort and
ease. It became known that he was in the habit of sending men to
scoundrels who did not consider consequences, and of inciting them to
give trouble and attempt my life, and making them hopeful with
promises. A band of these ill-fated ones of little foresight having
joined together, desired to attack me in the hunts that took place in
Kabul and those parts. As the grace and protection of God Almighty are
the guardians and keepers of this sublime dynasty, they did not attain
to their end. On the day when the halt was at the Surk&#863;h&#257;b,
one of that band went at the risk of his life to K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Wais&#299;, the D&#299;w&#257;n of my son K&#863;hurram, and revealed
that nearly 500 men at K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s instigation had conspired
with Fath&#803;u-llah, son of H&#803;ak&#299;m Ab&#363;-l-fath&#803;,
N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n, son of G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n
&#703;Al&#299; &#256;&#7779;af-k&#863;h&#257;n, and S&#863;har&#299;f,
son of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah (N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s
father), and were awaiting an opportunity <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>to carry out the
designs of the enemies and evil-wishers of the king. K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Wais&#299; told this to K&#863;hurram, and he in great perturbation
immediately told me. I gave K&#863;hurram the blessing of felicity, and
prepared to get hold of the whole set of those short-sighted ones and
punish them with various kinds of punishment. Again, it came to my
mind, as I was on the march, and the seizure of these people would
create a disturbance and confusion in the camp,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3817src" href="#xd24e3817" name="xd24e3817src">73</a> to order
the leaders of the disturbance and mischief to be apprehended. I handed
over Fath&#803;u-llah in confinement to certain trusty men, and ordered
capital punishment for the other two wretches, with three or four of
the chief among the black-faced (conspirators). I had dignified
Q&#257;sim &#703;Al&#299;, who was one of the servants of the late king
Akbar, after my accession with the title of Day&#257;nat
K&#863;h&#257;n. He always accused Fath&#803;u-llah of a want of
loyalty, and said things about him. One day he said to
Fath&#803;u-llah: &ldquo;At the time when K&#863;husrau fled and the
king pursued him, you said to me: &lsquo;The Panjab should be given to
K&#863;husrau and this quarrel cut short.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Fath&#803;u-llah denied this, and both resorted to oaths and curses (on
themselves). Ten or fifteen days had not passed after this altercation
when that hypocritical wretch was arrested, and his false oath did its
business.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 22nd Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal, the news
came of the death of the H&#803;ak&#299;m Jal&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n
Muz&#804;affar Ardist&#257;n&#299;, who was of a family of skill and

was perfect. Other physicians of the age could not compare with him. In
addition to his medical skill he had many excellencies. He had perfect
loyalty towards me. He built at Lahore a house of great pleasantness
and purity, and repeatedly asked me to honour it (with my presence). As
I was very fond of pleasing him I consented. In short, the aforesaid
H&#803;ak&#299;m, from his connection with me and being my physician,
had great skill in the management of affairs and business of the world,
so that for some time at Allahabad I made him Diwan of my
establishment. On account of his great honesty he was very exacting in
important business, and people were vexed at this method of proceeding.
For about twenty years he had ulcerated lungs, and by his wisdom
preserved in some measure his health. When he was talking he mostly
coughed so much that his cheek and eyes became red, and by degrees his
colour became blue. I often said to him: &ldquo;Thou art a learned
physician; why dost thou not cure thy own wounds?&rdquo; He represented
that wounds in the lungs were not of such a nature that they could be
cured. During his illness one of his confidential servants put poison
into some medicine he was in the habit of taking every day and gave it
to him. When he perceived this he took remedies for it. He objected
very much to be bled, although this was necessary. It happened that he
was going to the privy when his cough overcame him and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>opened the wounds in his lungs. So much blood
poured out of his mouth and brain that he became insensible and fell,
and made a fearful cry. An <i>&#257;ft&#257;bach&#299;</i>
(ewer-bearer) becoming aware of this, came into the assembly-room, and
seeing him smeared with blood cried out: &ldquo;They have killed the
h&#803;ak&#299;m.&rdquo; After examining him it was seen that there was
no sign of wounds on his body, and that it was the same wound in the
lungs that had begun to flow. They informed Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n,
who was the Governor of Lahore, and he, having ascertained the true
state of the affair, buried him. He left no capable son.</p>
<p class="par">On the 24th, between the garden of Waf&#257; and
N&#299;mlah, a hunt took place, and nearly forty red antelope were
killed. A female panther (<i>y&#363;z</i>) fell into our hands in this
hunt. The zamindars of that place, Lag&#863;hm&#257;n&#299;s,
S&#863;h&#257;l&#299;, and Afghans, came and said that they did not
remember nor had they heard from their fathers that a panther had been
seen in that region for 120 years. A halt was made on the 2nd
Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-&#257;k&#863;hir, at the Waf&#257; Garden, and the
assembly for the solar weighing was held. On the same day Arsl&#257;n
B&#299;, an &#362;zbeg who was one of the Sardars and nobles of
&#703;Abdu-l-M&#363;min K&#863;h&#257;n, and was at that time governor
of the fort of K&#257;hmard, having left his fort, had the blessing of
waiting on me. As he had come from friendship and sincerity, I exalted
him with a special robe of honour. He is a simple &#362;zbeg, and is
fit to be educated and honoured. On the 4th of the month an order was
given that &#703;Izzat K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e3851src" href="#xd24e3851" name="xd24e3851src">76</a> of
Jal&#257;l&#257;b&#257;d, should make the hunting-ground of the Arzina
plain into a qamargah (ring-hunting ground). Nearly 300 animals were
captured, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>namely, 35 <i>q&#363;ch</i> (rams?), 25
<i>q&#363;s&#863;hq&#299;</i> (?), 90 <i>arg&#863;hal&#299;</i> (wild
sheep), 55 <i>t&#363;g&#863;hl&#299;</i> (yaks?), 95 antelope
(<i>saf&#299;da</i>).</p>
<p class="par">As it was the middle of the day when I arrived at the
hunting-place and the air was very hot, the (<i>t&#257;z&#299;</i>)
Arabian dogs had been exhausted.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3877src"
href="#xd24e3877" name="xd24e3877src">77</a> The time for running dogs
is in the morning or at the end of the day. On Saturday, the 12th, the
halt was at Ak&#363;ra Saray (?). At this stage S&#863;h&#257;h Beg
K&#863;h&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3883src" href="#xd24e3883"
name="xd24e3883src">78</a> with a good force, came and waited on me. He
was one who had been brought up by my father, the late king Akbar. In
himself he is a very brave man and energetic, so much so that
constantly in the time of my father he fought several single combats,
and in my own reign defended the fort of Qandahar from the hosts of the
ruler of Iran. It was besieged for a year before the royal army arrived
to his assistance. His manners towards his soldiers are those of an
Am&#299;r (nobleman, <i>umar&#257;y&#257;na</i>), and not according to
discipline (<i>qudrat</i>), especially towards those who have helped
him in battles or are with him in campaigns. He jokes much with his
servants, and this gives him an undignified appearance.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3893src" href="#xd24e3893" name=
"xd24e3893src">79</a> I have repeatedly warned him about this, but as
it is in his nature my remonstrances have had no effect.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 14th, I promoted H&#257;s&#863;him
K&#863;h&#257;n, who is one of the household, born ones of our dynasty,
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>the rank of 3,000 with 2,000 horse, and I made
him governor of the province of Orissa. On the same day news came that
Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, son of M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, who was in the province of Malwa, through
folly and youth had started with a body of rebels to go to the province
of the R&#257;n&#257; and join him. &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n,
the governor of that place, being informed of this event went after
him, and having made him prisoner on the way, slew several of the
wretches who had joined with him. An order was given that Ihtim&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n should start from Agra and bring the M&#299;rz&#257; to
the court. On the 25th of the aforesaid month news came that Im&#257;m
Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, nephew of Wal&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, ruler
of M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr, had killed him who was called
M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;usain, who had been reported to be the son of
M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h. In truth, the killing of the
sons of M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h is like the killing
of the demons, as they say that from every drop of their blood demons
are produced. In the station of Dhaka, S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n,
the Afghan, whom when I left I had placed at Peshawar to guard the
Khaibar Pass, came and waited on me. He had made no default in
preserving and guarding the road. Z&#804;afar K&#863;h&#257;n, son of
Zain K&#863;h&#257;n Koka, had been appointed to move on the
Dal&#257;z&#257;k Afghans and the tribe of Khatur, who had perpetrated
all kinds of misdeeds in the neighbourhood of Attock and the Beas and
that vicinity. After performing that service and the conquest of those
rebels, who numbered about 100,000 houses, and sending them off towards
Lahore, he came and waited upon me at the same halting-place, and it
was evident that he had performed that service as it ought to have been
done. As the month of Rajab, corresponding with the Il&#257;h&#299;
month of &#256;b&#257;n, had arrived,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3919src" href="#xd24e3919" name="xd24e3919src">80</a> and it was
known that this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128"
name="pb128">128</a>]</span>was one of the months fixed for the lunar
weighing (<i>wazn-i-qamar&#299;</i>) of my father, I determined that
the value of all the articles which he used to order for his own
weighing in the solar and lunar years should be estimated, and that
what this came to should be sent to the large cities for the repose of
the soul of that enlightened one, and be divided amongst the
necessitous and the faqirs. The total came to 100,000 rupees, equal to
300 Ir&#257;q tum&#257;ns, and 300,000 of the currency of the people of
M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr.</p>
<p class="par">Trustworthy men divided that sum among the twelve chief
cities, such as Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Gujarat (Ahmadabad), etc. On
Thursday, the 3rd Rajab, I favoured with the title of
K&#863;h&#257;n-jah&#257;n my son (<i>farzand</i>) &#7778;al&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n, who is not less to me than my own sons, and ordered
that they should in all firmans and orders write of him as
K&#863;h&#257;n-jah&#257;n. A special robe of honour and a jewelled
sword were also given him. Also, having entitled S&#863;h&#257;h Beg
K&#863;h&#257;n K&#863;h&#257;n-daur&#257;n, I presented him with a
jewelled waist-dagger, a male elephant, and a special horse. The whole
of the sarkars of T&#299;rah, Kabul, Bangash, and the province of
Saw&#257;d (Swat) Bajaur, with the (task of) beating back the Afghans
of those regions, and a jagir and the faujd&#257;rship were confirmed
to him. He took leave from B&#257;b&#257; H&#803;asan Abd&#257;l. I
also ordered R&#257;m D&#257;s Kachhw&#257;ha to receive a jagir in
this province and to be enrolled among the auxiliaries of this Subah. I
conferred on Kis&#863;han Chand, son of the Mota (fat) R&#257;ja, the
rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. A firman was written to
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n (Sayyid Far&#299;d), governor of
Gujarat, that as the good conduct and excellence and abstemiousness of
the son of Miy&#257;n Waj&#299;hu-d-d&#299;n<a class="noteref" id=

reported to me, he should hand over to him from me a sum of money, and
that he should write and send me some of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

which had been tested. If the grace of God should be with me I would
continually repeat<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3938src" href=
"#xd24e3938" name="xd24e3938src">82</a> them. Before this I had given
leave to Zafar K&#863;h&#257;n to go to B&#257;b&#257; H&#803;asan
Abd&#257;l to collect together game for sport. He had made a
<i>s&#863;h&#257;k&#863;hband</i> (literally a tying together of horns
or branches). Twenty-seven red deer and 68 white ones came into the
<i>s&#863;h&#257;k&#863;hband</i>. I myself struck with arrows 29
antelope, and Parw&#299;z and K&#863;hurram also killed some others
with arrows. Afterwards orders were given to the servants and courtiers
to shoot. K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n was the best shot, and in every
case of his striking an antelope the arrow penetrated through and
through.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3951src" href="#xd24e3951" name=
"xd24e3951src">83</a> Again, on the 14th of the month of Rajab, Zafar
K&#863;h&#257;n had arranged a qamargah at R&#257;walpind&#299;. I
struck with an arrow a red deer at a long distance, and was highly
delighted at the arrow striking him and his falling down. Thirty-four
red deer and 35 <i>qar&#257;-q&#363;yr&#363;g&#863;h</i> (black-tailed)
antelope, which in the Hindi language they call <i>chik&#257;ra</i>,
and two pigs were also killed. On the 21st another qamargah had been
arranged within three kos of the fort of Rohtas by the efforts and
exertions of Hil&#257;l K&#863;h&#257;n. I had taken with me to this
hunt those who were screened by the curtains of honour (the members of
the zan&#257;nah). The hunt was a good one and came off with great
<i>&eacute;clat</i>. Two hundred red and white antelope were killed.
Passing on from Rohtas, the hills of which contain these antelope,
there are in no place in the whole of Hindustan, with the exception of
Girjh&#257;k and Nandanah, red deer of this description. I ordered them
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>to catch and keep some of them alive, in order
that possibly some of them might reach Hindustan for breeding purposes.
On the 25th another hunt took place in the neighbourhood of Rohtas. In
this hunt also my sisters and the other ladies were with me, and nearly
100 red deer were killed. It was told me that S&#863;hams
K&#863;h&#257;n, uncle of Jal&#257;l K&#863;h&#257;n<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e3968src" href="#xd24e3968" name="xd24e3968src">84</a> Gakkhar
who was in that neighbourhood, notwithstanding his great age took much
delight in hunting, such that young men had not so much enjoyment in
it. When I heard that he was well-disposed towards faqirs and dervishes
I went to his house, and his disposition and manners pleased me. I
bestowed on him 2,000 rupees, and the same sum on his wives and
children, with five other villages with large receipts by way of
livelihood for them, that they might pass their days in comfort and
contentment. On the 6th S&#863;ha&#703;ban, at the halting-place of
Chand&#257;lah, the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; came and waited on me. I
was greatly pleased at obtaining his society again, for all the
physicians, Hindu and Musulman, had made up their minds that he would
die. Almighty God in His grace and mercy granted him the honour of
recovery, in order that it might be known to such as do not recognize
His will that for every difficult ill, which those who look on the
outside of causes only may have given up as hopeless, there is One who
is powerful to provide a cure and remedy out of His own kindness and
compassion. On the same day R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e3971src" href="#xd24e3971" name="xd24e3971src">85</a> one of
the most considerable of the Rajput Amirs, ashamed on account of the
fault he had committed in the matter of K&#863;husrau, and who was
living at his home, came, and under the patronage of the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; obtained the good <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>fortune of waiting on
me; his offences were pardoned. At the time that I left Agra in pursuit
of K&#863;husrau I had in full confidence left him in charge of Agra,
so that when the ladies (<i>mah&#803;alh&#257;</i>)<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e3982src" href="#xd24e3982" name="xd24e3982src">86</a> should
be sent for he might come with them. After the ladies were sent for he
went for two or three stages with them, and in the village of Mathura,
on merely hearing foolish tales, separated from them, and went to his
native place (Bikanir). He thought that as a commotion had arisen he
would see where the right road was. The merciful God, who cherishes His
servants, in a short time having arranged that affair broke the rope of
the alliance of those rebels, and this betrayal of his salt remained a
burden on his neck. In order to please the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; I
ordered the rank which he formerly held to be confirmed to him, and his
jagir to remain as it was. I promoted Sulaim&#257;n Beg, who was one of
my attendants from the time when I was prince, to the title of
Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n. On Monday, the 12th, a halt was
made at the garden of Dil-&#257;m&#299;z, which is on the bank of the
river Ravi. I waited on my mother in this garden. M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;, who had done approved service in command of the
army at Qandahar, waited on me, and I bestowed great favour on him.</p>
<p class="par">On Tuesday, the 13th, I auspiciously entered Lahore. The
next day M&#299;r K&#863;hal&#299;lu-llah, son of
G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n Muh&#803;ammad,
M&#299;rm&#299;r&#257;n, who was of the descendants of S&#863;h&#257;h

reign of S&#863;h&#257;h T&#804;ahm&#257;sp there was no family of such

in marriage to his own son Isma&#703;&#299;l M&#299;rz&#257;, and
making the sons of that M&#299;rm&#299;r&#257;n sons-in-law, gave his
younger daughter to his eldest son, who had the same name as his
grandfather, and connected (in marriage) the daughter of
Isma&#703;&#299;l M&#299;rz&#257;, who was born of the niece of the
Shah, to another son, M&#299;r K&#863;hal&#299;lu-llah. After the death
of the Shah, by degrees the family went to decay, until in the reign of
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s they became all at once extirpated,
and they lost the property and effects that they had and could no
longer remain in their own place. M&#299;r K&#863;hal&#299;lu-llah came
to wait upon me. As he had undergone trouble on the road, and the signs
of sincerity were apparent from his circumstances, having made him a
sharer of my unstinted favours I gave him 12,000 rupees in cash, and
promoted him to the rank of 1,000 personal and 200 horse, and gave an
order for a jagir.</p>
<p class="par">An order was given to the civil department
(<i>d&#299;w&#257;niy&#257;n</i>) to confer the rank of 8,000 personal
and 5,000 horse on my son K&#863;hurram, and to provide a jagir for him
in the neighbourhood of Ujjain, and to assign the Sarkar of
H&#803;i&#7779;&#257;r F&#299;r&#363;za to him. On Thursday, the 22nd,
on the invitation of &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, I went with my
ladies to his house and passed the night there. The next day he
presented before me his own offerings, of the value of ten lacs of
rupees, in jewels and jewelled things, robes, elephants, and horses.
Some single rubies and jacinths and some pearls, also silk cloths with
some pieces of porcelain from China and Tartary, were accepted, and I
made a present of the rest to him. Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n
from Gujarat sent by way of offering a ring made of a single ruby of
good colour, substance, and water, the stone, the socket, and the ring
being all of one piece. They weighed 1&frac12; tanks and one surkh,
which is equal to one misqal and 15 surkh. This was sent to me and much
approved. Till that day no one had ever heard of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>such

which the value was stated to be &pound;25,000, was also sent. The ring
was valued at the same figure.</p>
<p class="par">On the same day the envoy of the Sharif of Mecca came to
wait on me with a letter and the curtain of the door of the
Ka&#703;bah. He showed great friendship towards me. The said envoy had
bestowed on him 500,000 <i>d&#257;m</i>, equal to 7,000 or 8,000
rupees, and I resolved to send the Sharif the equivalent of 100,000
rupees of the precious things of Hindustan. On Thursday, the 10th of
the month, a piece of the Subah of Multan was added to the jagir of
M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;, though the whole of the province
of Thattah had been given to him in jagir. He was also promoted to the
rank of 5,000 personalty and 5,000 horse. The government of Qandahar
and the protection of that region, which is the frontier of Hindustan,
were assigned to his excellent administration. Conferring on him a robe
of honour and a jewelled sword I gave him his leave. In fine,
M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; possessed perfection,<a class=

(R&#363;z-i-r&#363;shan, Bhopal 1297, p. 455; also
Ma&#702;&#257;s&#804;iru-l-umar&#257;, vol. iii, p. 347). This is one

<p class="par">On the 15th the offering of the Khankhanan was presented
to me: 40 elephants, some jewelled and decorated vessels, some Persian
robes, and cloth that they make in the Deccan and those parts, had been
sent by him, altogether of the value of 150,000 rupees. M&#299;rz&#257;
Rustam and most of the office-holders of that Subah had also sent good
offerings. Some of the elephants were approved. News of the death of

been brought up by my revered father, arrived on the 18th of the month.
He had been in attendance for forty years and more in the position of
an Am&#299;r on my revered father, until, by degrees, he had risen in
rank to 4,000. Before he obtained the good fortune of waiting on my
father he was one of the trusted servants of R&#257;n&#257; &#362;day
Singh. He died on the 29th. He was a good military man.
Sult&#804;&#257;n S&#863;h&#257;h, the Afghan, whose disposition was
turbulent and mischievous, passed his time in the service of
K&#863;husrau, and had his complete intimacy, so much so that this
rebel was the cause of the running away of that unfortunate one. After
the defeat and capture of K&#863;husrau he went off alone(?)<a class=

"xd24e4052src">91</a> into the skirts of the hills of
K&#863;hiz&#803;r&#257;b&#257;d and that region. At last he was made
prisoner by M&#299;r Mug&#863;hal, the <i>karor&#299;</i> of that
place. As he had been the cause of the destruction and ruin of such a
son, I ordered them to shoot him with arrows on the plain of Lahore.
The aforesaid <span class="corr" id="xd24e4063" title=

K&#863;h&#257;n, the Afghan, who was one of my old servants, died. One
might say that he took his own life, because he was continually
drinking wine, to the extent that in every watch he used to drink four
brimming cups of arrack of double strength. He had broken the fast of
the Ramaz&#803;&#257;n of the past year, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

head this year that he would fast in the month of Sha&#703;b&#257;n on
account of his having broken the fast of Ramaz&#803;&#257;n, and would
fast for two months together. In abandoning his usual custom, which is
a second nature, he became weak and his appetite left him, and becoming
very weak he passed away in his 57th year. Patronising his children and
brothers according to their circumstances, I bestowed on them a portion
of his rank and jagir.</p>
<p class="par">On the 1st of the month of S&#863;haww&#257;l I went to
visit Maul&#257;n&#257; Muh&#803;ammad Am&#299;n, who was one of the
disciples of S&#863;haik&#863;h Mah&#803;m&#363;d Kam&#257;ngar (the
bow-maker). The S&#863;haik&#863;h Mah&#803;m&#363;d<a class="noteref"

mentioned was one of the great men of his age, and H.M.
Hum&#257;y&#363;n had entire reliance on him, so much so that he once
poured water on his hands. The aforesaid Maul&#257;n&#257; is a man of
good disposition, and is free, notwithstanding the attachments and
accidents (of the world), a faqir in manner and ways, and acquainted
with brokenness of spirit. His company pleased me exceedingly. I
explained to him some of the griefs that had entangled themselves in my
mind and heard from him good advice and agreeable words, and found
myself greatly consoled at heart. Having presented him with 1,000
<i>b&#299;gh&#257;</i> and 1,000 rupees in cash by way of maintenance,
I took leave. One watch of day had passed on Sunday when I left Lahore
on my way to the capital of Agra. Having made Qil&#299;j
K&#863;h&#257;n governor, M&#299;r Qaw&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n diwan,
S&#863;haik&#863;h Y&#363;suf bakhshi, and Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n
kotwal, and presented each according to his circumstances with dresses
of honour, I turned towards my desired way. On the 25th, having passed
over the river at Sult&#804;anp&#363;r, I proceeded two kos and halted
at Nakodar. My revered father had given <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4078src" href=
"#xd24e4078" name="xd24e4078src">93</a> gold of the weight of 20,000
rupees to build an embankment between these two parganahs and prepare a
waterfall, and in truth I found a halting-place exceedingly pleasant
and fresh. I ordered Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk, the jagirdar of Nakodar, to
erect a building and prepare a garden on one side of this embankment,
so that wayfarers seeing it might be pleased. On Saturday, 10th
Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da, Waz&#299;ru-l-mulk, who before my ascension
had the good fortune to serve me, and was Diwan of my establishment,
died of diarrh&oelig;a. At the end of his life a son of evil fortune
(lit footsteps) had been born in his house, who in the space of forty
days ruined<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4081src" href="#xd24e4081" name=
"xd24e4081src">94</a> (Erskine has &lsquo;ate&rsquo;) both his father
and mother, and who himself died when he was two or three years old. It
occurred to me that the house of Waz&#299;ru-l-mulk must not all at
once be ruined, and patronising Man&#7779;&#363;r, his brother&rsquo;s
son, I gave him rank. Indeed,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4093src" href=
"#xd24e4093" name="xd24e4093src">95</a> he showed no love to me (the
scent of love did not come from him). On Monday, the 14th, I heard on
the road that between Panipat and Karnal there were two tigers that
were giving much trouble to wayfarers. I collected the elephants and
sent them off. When I arrived at their (the tigers&rsquo;) place I
mounted a female elephant, and ordered them to place the elephants
round them after the manner of a qamargah (enclosure), and by the
favour of Allah killed both with a gun, and thus got rid of the raging
tigers that had closed the road to the servants of God. On Thursday,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=

href="#xd24e4098" name="xd24e4098src">96</a> I halted at Delhi and
alighted at the residence which Sal&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n, the Afghan,
had made in the days of his rule in the middle of the river Jumna and
called Sal&#299;mga&#7693;h. My revered father had given the place to
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, who was originally an inhabitant of
Delhi. The aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n had built on the margin of the
river a terrace of stone excessively pleasant and bright. Below that
building<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4101src" href="#xd24e4101" name=
"xd24e4101src">97</a> near the water there was made a square
<i>chaukand&#299;</i> with glazed tiles by the order of H.M.
Hum&#257;y&#363;n, and there are few places with such air. In the days
when the late king Hum&#257;y&#363;n honoured Delhi with his presence,
he often sat there with his intimates, and associated with the members
of his assemblies. I passed four days in that place, and with my
courtiers and intimates enjoyed myself with wine parties.
Mu&#703;az&#804;z&#804;am K&#863;h&#257;n, who was governor of Delhi,
presented offerings. The jagirdars and citizens also made offerings and
presents, each according to his circumstances. I was desirous to employ
some days in a qamargah hunt in the parganah of P&#257;lam, which is
one of the places near the aforesaid city and one of the fixed
hunting-grounds. As it was represented to me that the (fortunate) hour
for approaching Agra had come very near, and another proper hour was
not to be obtained at all near that time, I gave up the intention, and
embarking on board a boat went on by water. On the 20th of the month of
Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da four boys and three girls, children of
M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, whom he had not mentioned to
my father, were brought. I placed the boys among my confidential
servants, and made over the girls to the attendants of the ladies of
the harem in order that they might look after them. On the 21st of the
same month R&#257;j&#257; M&#257;n Singh came and waited on me
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>from the fort of Rohtas, which is in the
province of Patna and Behar, after orders had been sent to him six or
seven times. He also, like K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, is one of
the hypocrites and old wolves of this State. What they have done to me,
and what has happened to them from me, God the knower of secrets knows;
possibly no one could mention such another case(?). The aforesaid Raja
produced as offerings 100 elephants, male and female, not one of which
was fit to be included among my private elephants. As he was one of
those who had been favoured by my father, I did not parade his offences
before his face, but with royal condescension promoted him.</p>

Apparently the correct sum in rupees is 34 lakhs 25,000. At p. 61 the

at its ordinary value of one-fortieth of a rupee, the number of rupees
should be 40 lakhs 25,000, and if the khani of Turan be one-third of a
rupee we should read one kror instead of one arb. Probably
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r has used arb as meaning kror, and not 100 krors.
There is a valuable note on his expedition through the Ghakkar country
in Blochmann, p. 486. Blochmann takes the figures for the rupees to be

B&#257;yaz&#299;d Biy&#257;t describes Hum&#257;y&#363;n as holding a
cooking festival in Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#257;n. See A.N., i,
translation, p. 496, n. 2. They cooked <i>bug&#863;hra</i>, which
appears to be macaroni. The text wrongly has <i>raqz&#803; az
&#703;is&#863;hq</i> (love-dances). The real word, as the MSS. show, is
<i>arg&#863;hus&#863;htaq</i>, which is a kind of dance (not a
child&rsquo;s game as in Johnson). It is described in Vullers, s.v., in
accordance with the account in the Burh&#257;n-i-q&#257;t&#804;i&#703;.
It is a dance by girls or young men, and is accompanied with singing
and with clapping of hands, etc. Probably it is the dance described by
Elphinstone in his account of Kabul, i, 311, where he says: &ldquo;The
great delight of all the western Afghans is to dance the Attun or
Ghoomboor. From ten to twenty men or women stand up in a circle (in
summer before their houses and tents, and in winter round a fire); a
person stands within the circle to sing and play on some instrument.
The dancers go through a number of attitudes and figures; shouting,
clapping their hands, and snapping their fingers. Every now and then
they join hands, and move slow or fast according to the music, all
joining in chorus. When I was showed this, a love-song was sung to an
extremely pretty tune, very simple, and not unlike a Scottish
air.&rdquo; Erskine&rsquo;s translation is: &ldquo;Custards and
confections were presented, and the amusements of dancing girls and
arghustak were introduced.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Probably the sections which Jah&#257;ng&#299;r wrote were those printed
in the Ilminsky edition and which bring the narrative down to
B&#257;bar&rsquo;s death. They seem to have been in great measure
copied from the Akbar-n&#257;ma. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r does not say if he
wrote them when he was in Kabul or previously. According to Blochmann,
J.A.S.B. for 1869, p. 134, one <i>juz&#702;</i> = two sheets of paper.
The passage is translated in Elliot, vi, 315. Though Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
does not say when he wrote the four sections, I think that his language
implies that these additions were in the manuscript when he was looking
at it in Kabul. Perhaps he made them when he was a student in India,
and for the sake of practice in Turk&#299;. He may have translated the
sections from the Akbar-n&#257;ma. All, I think, he did in Kabul was to
put the Turk&#299; note, stating that the sections were his. But
possibly even this was done before. Elliot, vi, 315, has the words
&ldquo;to complete the work,&rdquo; but these words do not occur in the
MSS. that I have seen. The translation in Elliot, seems to represent
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s words as meaning that the work was complete,
but that the four sections were not, like the rest, in
B&#257;bar&rsquo;s handwriting, and so Jah&#257;ng&#299;r re-copied
them. But it does not appear that there could be any object in his
doing this. There is a valuable article in the <span lang=

141, by Dr. Teufel, entitled &ldquo;<span lang="de">B&acirc;bur und

passage is obscure and the text is corrupt. Erskine&rsquo;s translation
is: &ldquo;His manners towards the soldiers is frank and gallant, but
not according to the rules of discipline, especially towards those who
have been or are in the wars with him. He is much flattered by his
servants, which gives him a light appearance.&rdquo; Evidently Erskine
read <i>udz&#299;</i> or <i>n&#257;z</i> instead of <i>b&#257;z</i> as
in the text, and the MSS. support his reading. I think, however, that
<i>n&#257;z kas&#863;h&#299;dan</i> means &lsquo;to jest.&rsquo;
Instead of the <i>t&#257; bam&#257;ndand</i> of text the MSS. have
<i>y&#257; nam&#257;yand</i>, the meaning being those soldiers who have
served him well, or are doing so. We learn from Blochmann, p. 378, that

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On Thursday, the 2nd Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja,
corresponding with the 1st Farward&#299;n (19th March, 1608), the Sun,
which enlightens and heats the world with its splendour, changed from
the constellation of Pisces to the joyful mansion of Aries, the abode
of pleasure and rejoicing. It gave the world fresh brightness, and
being aided by the Spring clothed those who had been plundered by the
cold season, and tyrannised over by the Autumn, with the robes of
honour of the New Year and the garments of emerald green, and gave them
compensation and recuperation.</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="par">The feast of the New Year was held in the village of
Rankatta,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4150src" href="#xd24e4150" name=
"xd24e4150src">1</a> which is five kos off (from Agra), and at the time
of transit (of the sun) I seated myself on the throne with glory and
gladness. The nobles and courtiers and all the servants came forward
with their congratulations. In the same assembly I bestowed on
K&#863;h&#257;njah&#257;n the rank of 5,000 personal and horse. I
selected K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n for the post of bakhshi.
Dismissing Waz&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n from the Viziership of the
province of Bengal, I sent in his place Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan
S&#863;hih&#257;bk&#863;h&#257;n&#299;; and N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n
Qul&#299; became kotwal of Agra. As the glorious mausoleum of the late
king Akbar was on the road, it entered my mind that if in passing by I
should have the good fortune of a pilgrimage to it, it might occur to
those who were short-sighted that I visited it because it was the place
where my road crossed. I accordingly had determined that this time I
would enter Agra, and after that would go on foot on this pilgrimage to
the shrine, which is two and a half kos off, in the same way that the
H&#803;az&#803;rat (my father), on account of my birth, had gone from
Agra to Ajmir. Would that I might also traverse the same on my head!
When two watches of day had passed of Saturday, the 5th<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4153src" href="#xd24e4153" name="xd24e4153src">2</a>
of the month, at an auspicious hour, I returned towards Agra, and
scattering with two hands 5000 rupees in small coins on the way,
entered the august palace which was inside the fort. On this day
R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo brought a white cheeta to show me.
Although other sorts <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140"
name="pb140">140</a>]</span>of creatures, both birds and beasts, have
white varieties, which they call
<i>t&#804;&#363;yg&#863;h&#257;n</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4161src" href="#xd24e4161" name="xd24e4161src">3</a> I had never
seen a white cheeta. Its spots, which are (usually) black, were of a
blue colour, and the whiteness of the body was also inclined to
bluishness. Of the albino animals that I have seen there are falcons,
sparrow-hawks, hawks (<i>s&#863;hikara</i>) that they call
<i>b&#299;g&#363;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e4175src" href=
"#xd24e4175" name="xd24e4175src">4</a> in the Persian language,
sparrows, crows, partridges, florican, <i>podna</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd24e4188src" href="#xd24e4188" name="xd24e4188src">5</a>
(<i>Sylvia olivacea</i>), and peacocks. Many hawks in aviaries are
albinos. I have also seen white flying mice (flying squirrels) and some
albinos among the black antelope, which is a species found only in
Hindustan. Among the <i>chik&#257;ra</i> (gazelle), which they call
<i>saf&#299;da</i> in Persia, I have frequently seen albinos. At this
time Ratan, son of Bhoj-h&#257;ra, who is one of the chief Rajput
nobles, came to the camp and waited on me, bringing three elephants as
an offering. One of these was much approved, and they valued it in the
office at 15,000 rupees. It was entered among my private elephants, and
I gave it the name of Ratangaj. The value of elephants of the former
great Rajas of India was not more than 25,000 rupees, but they have now
become very dear. I dignified Ratan with the title of Sarbuland
R&#257;y. I promoted M&#299;r&#257;n &#7778;adr Jah&#257;n to the rank
of 5,000 personal and 1,500 horse and Mu&#703;az&#804;z&#804;am
K&#863;h&#257;n to 4,000 personal and 2,000 horse. &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n was promoted to 3,000 and 500 horse. Muz&#804;affar
K&#863;h&#257;n and Bh&#257;o Singh each obtained the rank of 2,000
personal and 1,000 horse. Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan diwan had 1,000 and
500 horse. I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah that of 1,000 personal and 250
horse. On the 25th R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh, the maternal uncle of my
son K&#863;hurram, came and paid his respects to me. He brought with
him Shy&#257;m, the cousin of the turbulent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>Umr&#257;. In truth he possesses some skill and
understands well how to ride elephants. R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh had
brought with him a poet who wrote verse in the Hindi tongue. He laid
before me a poem in my praise to the purport that if the Sun had a son
it would be always day and never would be night, because after his
setting that son would sit in his place and keep the world in light.
Praise and thanksgiving to God that God gave your father such a son
that after his death men should not wear mourning which is like the
night. The Sun had envy on this account, saying, &ldquo;Would I might
also have a son who, taking my place, should not allow night to
approach the world, for from the light of your rising and the
illumination of your justice, notwithstanding such a misfortune, the
spheres are so bright that one might say &lsquo;night had neither name
nor sign.&rsquo;&rdquo; Few Hindi verses of such freshness of purport
have ever reached my ear. As a reward for this eulogy I gave him an
elephant. The Rajputs call a poet Ch&#257;ran (name of a caste who are
many of them poets). One of the poets of the age has turned<a class=

<p class="par first">On Thursday, the 8th Muh&#803;arram, 1017<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4228src" href="#xd24e4228" name="xd24e4228src">7</a>
(24th April, 1608), Jal&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n Mas&#703;&#363;d, who held
the rank of 400 personal and was not wanting in bravery, and who in
several battles had done great deeds, died at about the age of 50 or 60
years of diarrh&oelig;a. He was an opium-eater, and used to eat opium
after breaking it in pieces, like <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142"
href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>cheese, and it is notorious
that he frequently ate opium from the hand of his own mother. When his
disease became violent and there was a prospect of his death, his
mother from excessive love for him ate more opium than was right out of
that which she used to give her son, and two or three hours after his
death she also died. I have never heard of such affection on the part
of a mother for her son. It is the custom among the Hindus that after
the death of their husbands women burn themselves, whether from love,
or to save the honour of their fathers, or from being ashamed before
their sons-in-law, but nothing like this was ever manifested on the
part of mothers, Musulman or Hindu. On the 15th of the same month I
presented my best horse by way of favour to R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh.
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s had sent this horse with some other
horses and fitting gifts by Min&#363;chihr, one of his confidential
slaves, to the late king Akbar. From being presented with this horse
the Raja was so delighted that if I had given him a kingdom I do not
think he would have shown such joy. At the time they brought the horse
it was three or four years old. It grew up in Hindustan. The whole of
the servants of the Court, Moghul and Rajput together, represented that
no horse like this had ever come from Iraq to Hindustan. When my
revered father gave the province of Khandesh and the Subah of the
Deccan to my brother D&#257;niy&#257;l, and was returning to Agra, he
by way of kindness told D&#257;niy&#257;l to ask of him whatever he
desired. Seizing the opportunity, he asked for this horse, and he
accordingly gave it to him. On Tuesday, the 20th, a report came from
Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n with the news of the death of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of the Subah
of Bengal, who was my special slave. On account of his natural
excellence and innate merit he had been enrolled in the list of the
great Amirs. I was much grieved at his death. I bestowed the rule of
Bengal and the tutorship <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href=

name="xd24e4237src">8</a> Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n, and in his place
gave the government of the Subah of Behar to Afz&#803;al
K&#863;h&#257;n (son of Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l). The son of
H&#803;ak&#299;m &#703;Al&#299;, whom I had sent on some duties to
Burhanpur, came and brought with him some Karnatic jugglers who had no
rivals or equals; for instance, one of them played with ten balls, each
of which was equal to an orange and one to a citron, and one to a
<i>surk&#863;h</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4247src" href=
"#xd24e4247" name="xd24e4247src">9</a> in such a way that
notwithstanding some were small and some large he never missed one, and
did so many kinds of tricks that one&rsquo;s wits became bewildered. At
the same time a dervish from Ceylon came and brought a strange animal
called a <i>deonak</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e4255src" href=
"#xd24e4255" name="xd24e4255src">10</a> (or <i>devang</i>). Its face
was exactly like a large bat, and the whole shape was like that of a
monkey, but it had no tail. Its movements were like those of the black
tailless monkey which they call <i>ban m&#257;nus&#863;h</i> (jungle
man) in the Hindi language. Its body was like that of a young monkey
two or three months old. It had been with the dervish for five
years.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4276src" href="#xd24e4276" name=

appeared very strange, I ordered the artists to take a likeness of it
in various kinds of movement. It looked very ugly.</p>
<p class="par">On the same day M&#299;rz&#257; Far&#299;d&#363;n
Barl&#257;s was promoted to the rank of 1,500 personal and 1,300 horse.
An order was given that P&#257;yanda<a class="noteref" id=

K&#863;h&#257;n Moghul, as he had reached old age after exerting
himself as a soldier, should receive a jagir equal to 2,000 personal.
Ilf K&#863;h&#257;n was promoted to the rank of 700 personal and 500
horse. The rank of Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n<span class="corr" id=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=

at 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse. The guardianship of the fort of
Rohtas was bestowed on Kis&#863;hwar K&#863;h&#257;n, son of
Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n Koka. Ihtim&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n was raised to the rank of 1,000 personal and 300 horse,
and made <i>m&#299;r bah&#803;r</i> (admiral) and was appointed to the
charge of the <i>naw&#257;ra</i> (fleet) of Bengal. On the 1st
&#7778;afar S&#863;hamsu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n, son of
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, made an offering of ten elephants,
and, receiving the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, was selected
for the title of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, and
Z&#804;afar K&#863;h&#257;n received the rank of 2,000 personal and
1,000 horse. As I had demanded in marriage the daughter of Jagat Singh,
eldest son of R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh, I on the 16th sent 80,000
rupees for the <i>s&#257;chaq</i> (a marriage present) to the house of
the aforesaid Raja in order to dignify him. Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n
sent from the port of Cambay a European curtain (tapestry), the like of
which in beauty no other work of the Frank painters had ever been seen.
On the same day my aunt, Naj&#299;bu-n-nis&#257; Begam,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4302src" href="#xd24e4302" name=
"xd24e4302src">13</a> died in the 61st year of her age of the disease
of consumption and hectic fever. I promoted her son, M&#299;rz&#257;
W&#257;l&#299;, to the rank of 1,000 personal and 200 horse. A man of
M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr, of the name of Aqam
H&#803;&#257;j&#299;, who for a long time had been in Turkey and was
not without reasonableness and religious knowledge, and who called
himself the ambassador of the Turkish Emperor, waited upon me at Agra.
He had an unknown writing (? illegible letter). Looking to his
circumstances and his proceedings none of the servants of the Court
believed in his being an ambassador. When T&#299;m&#363;r conquered
Turkey, and Yildir&#299;m B&#257;yaz&#299;d, the ruler <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>of
that place, fell alive into his hands, he, after levying tribute and
taking one year&rsquo;s revenue, determined to hand back into his
possession the whole of the country of Turkey. Just at that time
Yildir&#299;m B&#257;yaz&#299;d died, and (T&#299;m&#363;r), having
handed over the kingdom to his son M&#363;s&#257; Cheleb&#299;,
returned. From that time until now, notwithstanding such favours, no
one had come on the part of the emperors, nor has any ambassador been
sent: how, then, can it now be believed that this person from
M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr should have been sent by the emperor? I
could in no way understand the affair, and no one could bear witness to
the accuracy of his claim: I therefore told him to go wherever he might
wish. On the 4th Rab&#299;&#703;u-1-awwal the daughter of Jagat Singh
entered the harem, and the marriage ceremony was performed in the house
of Her Highness Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;. Amongst the things sent with
her by R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh were 60 elephants.</p>
<p class="par">As I had determined to conquer the R&#257;n&#257;, it
occurred to me that I should send Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n. I
appointed 12,000 fully armed cavalry under able officers to go with
him, and in addition 500 ahadis, 2,000 musketeers on foot, with
artillery made up of 70 to 80 guns mounted on elephants and camels; 60
elephants were appointed to this duty. Two million rupees of treasure
were ordered to be sent with this army. On the 16th of the said month
M&#299;r K&#863;hal&#299;lu-llah, grandson of M&#299;r
Ni&#703;matu-llah Yazd&#299;, the whole of whose circumstances and
family history has already been written, died of diarrh&oelig;a. In his
appearance the traces of sincerity and dervishhood were
manifest<span class="corr" id="xd24e4309" title=
"Not in source">.</span> If he had lived and passed a long time in my
service he would have risen to high rank. The bakhshi of Burhanpur had
sent some mangoes, one of which I ordered to be weighed; it came to
52&frac12; tolas. On Wednesday, the 18th, in the house of
Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;, the feast of the lunar weighing of my 40th
year <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>was held. I ordered the money used in weighing
to be divided amongst women and needy persons. On Thursday, the 4th
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-&#257;k&#863;hir, T&#804;&#257;hir Beg, the bakhshi
of the Ahadis, was given the title of Muk&#863;hli&#7779;
K&#863;h&#257;n, and Mull&#257;-i-Taqiyy&#257;
S&#863;h&#363;star&#299;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4314src" href=

excellencies and perfections, and was well acquainted with the science
of history and genealogy, that of Mu&#702;arrik&#863;h K&#863;h&#257;n.
On the 10th of the same month, having given Bark&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;r,
the brother of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, the title of
Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n, I dignified him among his fellows.
M&#363;nis K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Mihtar K&#863;h&#257;n, presented me
with a jug of jasper (jade), which had been made in the reign of
M&#299;rz&#257; Ulug&#863;h Beg G&#363;rg&#257;n, in the honoured name
of that prince. It was a very delicate rarity and of a beautiful shape.
Its stone was exceedingly white and pure. Around the neck of the jar
they had carved the auspicious name of the M&#299;rz&#257; and the
Hijra year in <i>riq&#257;&#703;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4319src" href="#xd24e4319" name="xd24e4319src">15</a> characters.
I ordered them to inscribe my name and the auspicious name of Akbar on
the edge of the lip of the jar. Mihtar<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4324src" href="#xd24e4324" name="xd24e4324src">16</a>
K&#863;h&#257;n was one of the ancient slaves of this State. He had the
honour of serving the late king Hum&#257;y&#363;n, and during the reign
of my revered father had attained the rank of nobility. He regarded him
as one of his confidential servants. On the 16th a firman was issued
that the country of Sangr&#257;m,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4328src"
href="#xd24e4328" name="xd24e4328src">17</a> which had been given for a
year by way of reward to my son (<i>farzand</i>) Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, should be handed over for the same purpose for a year
to Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of the Subah of Behar. On
this day I promoted Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n to the rank of 3,000
personal and 2,500 horse, and Y&#363;suf K&#863;h&#257;n, son of
H&#803;usain K&#863;h&#257;n Tukriyah, obtained that of 2,000
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>personal and 800 horse. On the 24th I gave leave
to Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n and the Amirs and men who had been
appointed to subdue the R&#257;n&#257;. The aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n
was honoured with a robe of honour, a horse, a special elephant, and a
jewelled sword. Zafar K&#863;h&#257;n, having been honoured with a
standard, was presented with a private robe of honour and a jewelled
dagger. S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n also was presented
with a standard, and I gave him a robe of honour and a special
elephant. R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo received a robe of honour and a
special horse, and Mangl&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n a horse and jewelled
dagger. Nar&#257;yan D&#257;s Kachhw&#257;hah, &#703;Al&#299; Qul&#299;
Darman, and Hizabr K&#863;h&#257;n Tahamtan obtained leave. On
Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n and Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk the bakhshi
jewelled daggers were conferred, and in the same manner all the Amirs
and leaders, each one according to his degree, were honoured with royal
gifts. A watch of the day had passed when the Khankhanan, who had been
selected for the high honour of my &#256;t&#257;l&#299;q (guardian),
came from Burhanpur and waited on me. Delight and happiness had so
overpowered him that he did not know whether he came on his head or his
feet. He threw himself bewildered at my feet. By way of favour and
kindness I lifted up his head and held it in an embrace of kindliness
and affection, and kissed his face. He brought me as offerings two
strings of pearls and some rubies and emeralds. The value of the jewels
was 300,000 rupees. Besides these he laid before me many valuable
things. On the 17th Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal Waz&#299;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, the Diwan of Bengal, came and waited on me, and
offered 60 elephants, male and female, and one Egyptian<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4336src" href="#xd24e4336" name=
"xd24e4336src">18</a> ruby. As he was one of the old servants and he
performed every duty, I ordered him to remain in attendance on me. As
Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n and his elder brother, Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, could in no way <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148"
href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>keep the peace together, I
had sent for the former to my own presence, and he yesterday came and
waited on me. On the 22nd, &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, made me an
offering of a ruby of the weight of seven <i>&#7789;&#257;nk</i>, which
Ab&#363;-l-q&#257;sim, his brother, had bought in the port of Cambay
for 75,000 rupees. It is of a beautiful colour and well-shaped, but to
my belief is not worth more than 60,000 rupees. Great faults had been
committed by Dul&#299;p R&#257;y, son of R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh, but
as he took refuge with my <i>farzand</i> K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n his
offences were pardoned, and I knowingly and purposely passed over his
delinquencies. On the 24th the sons of
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, who had followed after him,
arrived and waited on me and produced as an offering the sum of 25,000
rupees. On the same day the said K&#863;h&#257;n offered 90 elephants.
On Thursday, the 1st Jum&#257;d&#257;-s&#804;-s&#804;&#257;n&#299;, the
feast of my solar year was celebrated in the house of
Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;. Some of the money I divided among the women,
and an order was given that the balance should be distributed to the
poor of the hereditary kingdoms. On the 4th of the month I ordered the
Diwans to give a jagir, according to his rank, of 7,000 rupees to
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am.</p>
<p class="par">On this day a female antelope in milk was brought that
allowed itself to be milked with ease, and gave every day four seers of
milk. I had never seen or heard of anything of the kind before. The
milk of the antelope, of the cow, and the buffalo in no way differs.
They say it is of great use in asthma. On the 11th of the month
R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh asked for leave to complete the army of the
Deccan to which he had been appointed, as well as to visit Amber, his
native place. I gave him a male elephant of my own called
Hus&#863;hy&#257;r-mast, and gave him leave. On Monday, the 12th, as it
was the anniversary of the death of the late king Akbar, in addition to
the expenses of that entertainment, which are fixed separately, I sent
4,000 rupees more to be divided among the faqirs and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>dervishes who are present in the enlightened
mausoleum of the venerated one. On that day I exalted &#703;Abdu-llah,
the son of K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, with the title of
Sarfar&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n, and &#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m, son
of Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n, with that of Tarbiyat K&#863;h&#257;n.
On Tuesday, the 13th, I sent for K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s daughter, and
saw a child so like her father as no one can remember to have seen. The
astrologers used to say that her advent would not be auspicious to her
father, but would be auspicious to me. At last it became known that
they had augured rightly. They said that I should see her after three
years. I saw her when she had passed this age. On the 21st of the month
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n determined to clear out the
province of the Niz&#257;mu-l-mulk, into which, after the death of the
late king Akbar, some disturbances had found their way, and stated in
writing that &ldquo;If I do not complete this service in the course of
two years, I shall be guilty (of a fault), on the condition that in
addition to the force that had been allotted to that Subah 12,000 more
horse with 1,000,000 rupees should be sent with me.&rdquo; I ordered
that materials for the army and the treasure should be quickly
prepared, and he should be despatched. On the 26th Muk&#863;hli&#7779;
K&#863;h&#257;n, bakhshi of the ahadis, was appointed bakhshi of the
Subah of the Deccan, and I bestowed his place on Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
H&#803;usain K&#863;h&#257;n, the M&#299;r Bah&#803;r. On the 1st
Rajab, P&#299;s&#863;hrau K&#863;h&#257;n and Kam&#257;l
K&#863;h&#257;n, who belonged to the servants who were in constant
attendance on me (<i>r&#363;-s&#863;hin&#257;s</i>), died.
S&#863;h&#257;h Tahm&#257;sp had given P&#299;s&#863;hrau
K&#863;h&#257;n as a slave to my grandfather, and he was called
Sa&#703;&#257;dat. When he was promoted in the service of the late king
Akbar to the daroghahship and superintendence of the
<i>farr&#257;s&#863;hk&#863;h&#257;na</i> (carpet department), he
obtained the title of P&#299;s&#863;hrau. He was so well acquainted
with this service that one might say it was a garment they had sewn on
the stature of his capacity. When he was 90 years old he was quicker
than lads of 14. He had the good fortune <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>to serve my
grandfather, my father, and me. Until he breathed his last he was never
for a moment without the intoxication of wine.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Besmeared with wine

</div>
<p class="par first">He left 1,500,000 rupees. He has one very stupid
son, called Ri&#703;&#257;yat. On account of his father&rsquo;s claims
for services performed, I gave the superintendence of half the
farrashkhana to him and the other half to Tuk&#863;hm&#257;q
K&#863;h&#257;n. Kam&#257;l K&#863;h&#257;n was one of the slaves
sincerely devoted to my service; he is of the caste of the Kal&#257;ls
of Delhi. On account of the great honesty and trustworthiness that he
had shown I made him <i>bak&#257;wal-beg&#299;</i> (chief of the
kitchen). Few such servants are ever met with. He had two sons, to both
of whom I showed great kindness, but where are there others like him?
On the 2nd of the said month La&#703;l<a class="noteref" id=

Kal&#257;want, who from his childhood had grown up in my father&rsquo;s
service, who had taught him every breathing and sound that appertains
to the Hindi language, died in the 65th or 70th year of his age. One of
his girls (concubines) ate opium on this event and killed herself. Few
women among the Musulmans have ever shown such fidelity.</p>
<p class="par">In Hindustan, especially in the province of
Sylhet,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4385src" href="#xd24e4385" name=
"xd24e4385src">22</a> which is a dependency of Bengal, it was the
custom for the people of those parts to make eunuchs of some of their
sons and give them to the governor in place of revenue
(<i>m&#257;l-w&#257;jib&#299;</i>). This custom by degrees has been
adopted in other provinces, and every year some children are thus
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>ruined and cut off from procreation. This
practice has become common. At this time I issued an order that
hereafter no one should follow this abominable custom, and that the
traffic in young eunuchs should be completely done away with.
Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n and the other governors of the Subah of
Bengal received firmans that whoever should commit such acts should be
capitally punished, and that they should seize eunuchs of tender years
who might be in anyone&rsquo;s possession. No one of the former kings
had obtained this success. Please Almighty God, in a short time this
objectionable practice will be completely done away with, and the
traffic in eunuchs being forbidden, no one shall venture on this
unpleasant and unprofitable proceeding. I presented the
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n with a bay horse out of those
sent me by S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s; it was the head of the
stable of my private horses. He was so rejoiced over it that it would
be difficult to describe. In truth a horse of this great size and
beauty has hardly come to Hindustan. I also gave him the elephant
Fut&#363;h&#803;, that is unrivalled in fighting, with twenty other
elephants. As Kis&#863;han Singh, who was accompanying Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n, performed laudable service, and was wounded in the leg
by a spear in the fight with the R&#257;n&#257;&rsquo;s men, so that
about twenty noblemen of his were killed and about 3,000 made captive,
he was promoted to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. On the
14th of the same month I gave an order for M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; to betake himself to Qandahar. A strange
occurrence was that as soon as the aforesaid M&#299;rz&#257; started
from Bakhar for that province the news of the death of Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of that place, came. Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n was one of the permanent and intimate attendants of my
uncle Muhammad H&#803;ak&#299;m, and was known as Tuk&#863;hta<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4393src" href="#xd24e4393" name=
"xd24e4393src">23</a> Beg. I gave half his rank (the pay of it) to his
sons. On Monday, the 17th, I went on <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>foot on my pilgrimage
to the enlightened mausoleum of the late king. If it had been possible,
I would have traversed this road with my eyelashes and head. My revered
father, on account of my birth, had gone on foot on a pilgrimage to the
shrine of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n Sanjari
Chis&#863;ht&#299;, from Fath&#803;p&#363;r to Ajmir, a distance of 120
kos: if I should traverse this road with my head and eyes, what should
I have done? When I was dignified with the good fortune of making this
pilgrimage, I saw the building that had been erected in the cemetery.
It did not come up to my idea of what it ought to be, for that would be
approved which the wayfarers of the world should point to as one the
like of which was not in the inhabited world. Inasmuch as at the time
of erecting the aforesaid building the affair of the ill-starred
K&#863;husrau took place, I started for Lahore, and the architects had
built it after a design of their own. At last a certain expenditure was
made until a large sum was expended, and work went on for three or four
years. I ordered that experienced architects should again lay the
foundations, in agreement with men of experience, in several places, on
a settled plan. By degrees a lofty building was erected, and a very
bright garden was arranged round the building of the shrine, and a
large and lofty gateway with minarets of white stone was built. On the
whole they told me the cost of this lofty edifice was 1,500,000 rupees,
equivalent to 50,000 current tumans of Persia and 4,500,000 khanis,
according to the currency of T&#363;r&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 23rd, I went with a band of courtiers who
had not seen it to look at the reservoir in the house of
H&#803;ak&#299;m &#703;Al&#299; like one that had been made at Lahore
in the time of my father. The reservoir is 6 gaz by 6 gaz. At its side
has been erected a well-lighted room, the entrance to which is through
the water, but the water does not get into it. Ten or twelve people
could meet in it. He made an offering of some <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>of
the cash and jewels that had accumulated<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4402src" href="#xd24e4402" name="xd24e4402src">24</a> in his
time. After looking at the room, and the entering of a number of
courtiers therein, I raised him to the rank of 2,000, and returned to
the palace. On Sunday, the 14th S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n, the
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n was honoured with a jewelled
sword for the waist, a robe of honour, and a special elephant, and was
given leave to go to his duty in the Deccan. R&#257;ja S&#363;raj
Singh, who was attached to him in that service, was raised to the rank
of 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse. As it was again represented to me
that oppression was being committed by the brethren and attendants of
Murtaz&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n on the ryots and people of Ahmadabad in
Gujarat, and that he was unable properly to restrain his relations and
people about him, I transferred the Subah from him and gave it to
A&#703;z&#804;am K&#863;h&#257;n, and it was settled that the latter
should attend at court, and that his eldest son Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n should go to Gujarat as his deputy. The rank
of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n was fixed at 3,000
personal and 2,500 horse. An order was given that in company with Mohan
D&#257;s d&#299;w&#257;n and Mas&#703;&#363;d Beg
Hamaz&#817;&#257;n&#299; bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; he should carry on
the business of the province. Mohan D&#257;s was promoted to the rank
of 800 with 500 horse, and Mas&#703;&#363;d Beg to 300 with 150 horse.
Tarbiyat K&#863;h&#257;n, one of the personal servants, was given the
rank of 700 with 400 horse, and Na&#7779;ru-llah the same. Mihtar
K&#863;h&#257;n, whose circumstances have been related, died at this
time, and I promoted his son M&#363;nis K&#863;h&#257;n to the rank of
500 personal and 130 horse. On Wednesday, the 4th
Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja, K&#863;husrau had a son born to him by the
daughter of the K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, and I gave him the
name of Buland-ak&#863;htar. On the 6th of the same month Muqarrab
K&#863;h&#257;n sent a picture (with a report) that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>belief of the Franks was this, that the picture
was that of T&#299;m&#363;r. At the time when Yildir&#299;m
B&#257;yaz&#299;d was taken prisoner by his victorious army, a
Nazarene, who at that time was ruler<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4407src" href="#xd24e4407" name="xd24e4407src">25</a> of
Constantinople, had sent an ambassador with gifts and presents in token
of submission and service, and an artist who had been sent with the
ambassador took his likeness and brought it away. If this story were
true, no better gift could be presented to me. But as the picture had
no resemblance to any of his descendants I was not satisfied of the
truth of the statement.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Fourth New Year&rsquo;s Feast after the Auspicious
Accession.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The passing of the great star that illumines the
world into the constellation of Aries took place on the night of
Saturday, the 14th Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja, in Hijra 1017 (21st
March, 1609), and New Year&rsquo;s Day that made brilliant the world
began with good auspices and rejoicing. On Friday, the 5th
Muh&#803;arram, in the year 1018, H&#803;ak&#299;m &#703;Al&#299; died.
He was an unrivalled physician; he had derived much profit from Arabic
sciences. He had written a commentary on the Canon (of Avicenna) in the
time of my revered father. He had greater diligence than understanding,
just as his appearance was better than his disposition, and his
acquirements better than his talents; on the whole he was bad-hearted,
and of an evil spirit. On the 20th &#7778;afar I dignified
M&#299;rz&#257; Bark&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;r with the title of
K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam. They brought from the neighbourhood of
Fath&#803;p&#363;r a water-melon, greater than any I had ever seen. I
ordered them to weigh it, and it came to 33 seers. On Monday, the 19th
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal, the feast of my annual lunar weighing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>was arranged in the palace of my revered mother;
a part of the money was divided among the women who had assembled there
on that day.</p>
<p class="par">As it had been evident that in order to carry on the
affairs of the State in the Subah of the Deccan it was necessary to
send one of the princes there, it came into my mind to send my son
Parw&#299;z there. I ordered them to send his equipments and fix the
hour for his departure. I summoned to Court Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been nominated to the command of the army
against the rebel R&#257;n&#257; to arrange certain matters at
headquarters, and appointed in his place &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n, whom I exalted with the title of F&#299;r&#363;z-jang.
I sent &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; to carry an
order to all the mansabdars of that army not to depart from the orders
of the aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n, and to pay every heed to his thanks
and blame. On the 4th Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal one of the goatherds,
who are a particular tribe, brought before me a gelded goat that had
teats like a female, and gave every day sufficient milk to take with a
cup of coffee.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4419src" href="#xd24e4419"
name="xd24e4419src">1</a> As milk is one of the favours of Allah, and
the source which nourishes many animals, I looked on this strange
affair as an omen for good. On the 6th of the same month, having given
him the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, I sent K&#863;hurram,
son of K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, to the government of the
province of Sorath, which is known as J&#363;naga&#7693;h (in
Kathiyaw&#257;d). I honoured<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4422src" href=
"#xd24e4422" name="xd24e4422src">2</a> H&#803;ak&#299;m
&#7778;adr&#257; with the title of Masihu-z-zam&#257;n, and gave him
the rank of 500 personal and 30 horse. On the 16th a jewelled
waist-sword was sent to R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh. On the 22nd, having
handed over 2,000,000 rupees for the expenses of the army of the
Deccan, which had been ordered for Parw&#299;z, to a separate
treasurer, 500,000 rupees more were given for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>the
private expenses of Parw&#299;z. On the 25th, Wednesday,
Jah&#257;nd&#257;r (his son), who previously to this had been
appointed, together with Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n Koka,
to Bengal, came and waited on me. In reality it became known to me that
he was a born devotee.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4427src" href=
"#xd24e4427" name="xd24e4427src">3</a> As my mind was taken up with the
preparations for the Deccan, on the 1st
Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-&#257;k&#863;hir I nominated the
Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; as well to that duty. He was honoured with the
favour of a robe of honour and a horse. Having promoted Karam Chand,
son of Jagann&#257;th, to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, I
sent him in company with Parw&#299;z. On the 4th of the month 370 ahadi
horse were appointed with &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n to the
assistance of the army employed against the R&#257;n&#257;. One hundred
horses were also despatched from the government stables to be given as
he thought proper to the mansabdars and ahadis. On the 17th I gave a
ruby of the value of 60,000 rupees to Parw&#299;z, and another ruby
with two single pearls, worth about 40,000 rupees, to K&#863;hurram. On
Monday, the 28th, Jagann&#257;th was promoted to the rank of 5,000
personal and 3,000 horse, and on the 8th of Rajab, R&#257;y J&#257;y
Singh was promoted to that of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse, and was
dismissed for service in the Deccan. On Thursday, the 9th, Prince
S&#863;hahriy&#257;r from Gujarat came and waited on me. On Tuesday,
the 4th, I despatched my son Parw&#299;z on the service of conquering
the country of the Deccan. He was presented with a robe of honour, a
special horse, a special elephant, a sword, and a jewelled dagger. The
Sardars and Amirs who were appointed with him each according to his
condition received and were made happy with the favour of a horse, a
robe of honour, an elephant, a sword, and a jewelled dagger. I
appointed 1,000 ahadis to be in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157"
href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>attendance on Parw&#299;z for
the service of the Deccan. On the same day a representation came from
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n that having pursued the rebel
R&#257;n&#257; into the hill country into rough places, he had captured
several of his elephants and horses. When night came on he had escaped
with difficulty with his life. As he had made things go hard with him,
he would soon be taken prisoner or killed. I promoted the said
K&#863;h&#257;n to the rank of 5,000 personal, and a rosary of pearls,
worth 10,000 rupees, was given to Parw&#299;z. As I had given the
province of K&#863;handesh and Berar to the said son, I also conferred
on him the fort of &#256;s&#299;r, and 300 horse were sent with him to
be given to ahadis, mansabdars, and whomever else he might consider
worthy of favour. On the 26th, Saif K&#863;h&#257;n B&#257;rha was
given the rank of 2,500 personal and 1,350 horse, and appointed to the
faujd&#257;rship of the Sarkar of Hisar. On Monday, the 4th
Sha&#703;b&#257;n, an elephant was given to Waz&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n.
On Friday, the 22nd, I gave an order that as <i>bang</i> and
<i>b&#363;za</i> (rice spirit) were injurious, they should not be sold
in the bazars and that gambling should be abolished, and on this
subject I issued stringent orders. On the 25th they brought a tiger
from my private menagerie to fight with a bull. Many people gathered
together to see the show, and a band of Jogis (religious mendicants)
with them. One of the Jogis was naked, and the tiger, by way of sport,
and not with the idea of rage, turned towards him. It threw him on the
ground and began to behave to him as it would to its own female. The
next day and on several occasions the same thing took place. As no such
thing had ever been seen before and was exceedingly strange, this has
been recorded.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4441src" href="#xd24e4441"
name="xd24e4441src">4</a> On the 2nd of the month of

K&#863;h&#257;n was promoted to the rank of 1,500 personal and 800
horse. Far&#299;d&#363;n K&#863;h&#257;n Barl&#257;s was promoted to
the rank of 2,500 with 2,000 horse. One thousand <i>tolcha</i> of gold
and silver and 1,000 rupees were given in alms on the day of the
procession of the sun into the constellation of the Scorpion, which,
according to the general acceptation of the Hindoos, is called the
Sankr&#257;nt. On the 10th of that month an elephant was presented to
S&#863;h&#257;h Beg Y&#363;z&#299;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4453src"
href="#xd24e4453" name="xd24e4453src">6</a> (? the panther-keeper), and

On account of some suspicion that S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s had
entertained against him, he came to wait upon me. I patronised him, and
gave him the rank of 400 personal and 200 horse. Again, another force,
containing 193 mansabdars and 46 ahadis, I sent after Parw&#299;z for
service in the Deccan. Fifty horses were also entrusted to one of the
servants of the Court to convoy to Parw&#299;z.</p>

<p class="par first">On Sunday, the 15th, I sent 50,000 rupees as
<i>s&#257;chaq</i> to the house of the daughter of Muz&#804;affar
H&#803;usain M&#299;rz&#257;, son of Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain
M&#299;rz&#257;, son of Bahr&#257;m M&#299;rz&#257;, son of
S&#863;h&#257;h Isma&#703;&#299;l &#7778;afaw&#299;, who had been
demanded in marriage for my son K&#863;hurram. On the 17th of the month
Mub&#257;rak K&#863;h&#257;n Sarw&#257;n&#299; was honoured with the
rank of 1,000 personal and 300 horse. Five thousand rupees were also
given to him, and 4,000 rupees to H&#803;&#257;j&#299; B&#299;
&#362;zbeg. On the 22nd a ruby and a pearl were given to
S&#863;hahriy&#257;r. One hundred thousand rupees were given for the
subsistence of the &#362;ym&#257;qs (special cavalry) who had been
appointed for service in the Deccan. Two thousand rupees were given to
Farruk&#863;h Beg, the painter, who is unrivalled in the age. Four
thousand rupees were sent for expenditure on B&#257;b&#257; Hasan
Abd&#257;l. One thousand rupees were handed to Mull&#257;
&#703;Al&#299; Ah&#803;mad Muhrkan (engraver) and Mull&#257;
R&#363;zbih&#257;n S&#863;h&#299;r&#257;z&#299; to expend on the
anniversary festival of Hazrat S&#863;haik&#863;h Sal&#299;m at his
mausoleum. An elephant was given to Muhammad H&#803;usain, the writer,
and 1,000 rupees to K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;Abdu-l-Haqq
An&#7779;&#257;r&#299;. I gave orders to the Diwans that having raised
the rank of Murtaz&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n to 5,000 personal and horse
they should give him a jagir. I ordered Bih&#257;r&#299; Chand
Q&#257;n&#363;ng&#363;, of the Sarkar of Agra, to take 1,000 footmen
and equipment from the Zamindars of Agra, and, fixing their monthly
pay, to send them to Parw&#299;z in the Deccan, and 500,000 rupees more
were fixed for the expenses of Parw&#299;z. On Thursday, the 4th
S&#863;haww&#257;l, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160"
name="pb160">160</a>]</span>Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n was promoted to
the rank of 5,000 personal and 5,000 horse, Ab&#363;-l-wal&#299; Beg
&#362;zbeg to that of 1,500 and Z&#804;afar K&#863;h&#257;n to that of
2,500. Two thousand rupees were given to Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n,
son of M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, and 1,000 rupees to
Path&#257;n Mi&#7779;r. I ordered that drums should be given to all of
them as their rank had been raised to 3,000 and higher. Five thousand
rupees more of the money from my weighing were entrusted for the
construction of a bridge at B&#257;b&#257; H&#803;asan Abd&#257;l and
the building that is there to Ab&#363;-l-waf&#257;, son of
H&#803;ak&#299;m Ab&#363;-l-fath&#803;, in order that he might exert
himself and put the bridge and the aforesaid building in perfect order.
On Saturday, the 13th, when four gharis of day were left, the moon
began to be eclipsed. By degrees the whole of its body was obscured,
and it continued till five gharis of night had passed. In order to
avert the bad omen of this I had myself weighed against gold, silver,
cloth, and grain, and gave away in alms all kinds of animals, such as
elephants, horses, etc., the cost of all of which was 15,000 rupees. I
ordered them to be distributed among the deserving and the poor. On the
25th, at the request of her father, I took the daughter of R&#257;m
Chand Band&#299;lab into my service (i.e. married her). I gave an
elephant to M&#299;r F&#257;z&#803;il, nephew of M&#299;r
S&#863;har&#299;f, who had been appointed to the faujd&#257;rship of
Qab&#363;lah and those regions &#703;In&#257;yat-ullah was dignified
with the title of &#703;In&#257;yat K&#863;h&#257;n. On Wednesday, the
1st Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da, Bih&#257;r&#299; Chand was granted the
rank of 500 personal and 300 horse. A <i>khapwa</i> (dagger), adorned
with jewels was given to my son B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram.
Mull&#257; Hayat&#299;, by whom I had sent a message to the
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, with a verbal message containing
(expressions of) all kinds of condescension and affection, came and
brought before me a ruby and two pearls of the value of about 20,000
rupees, which the K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n had sent by
him. M&#299;r Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain, who was in Burhanpur
and whom <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>I had sent for, came and waited on me. I
presented S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n Dakhan&#299; with
2,000 rupees. On the 6th of the aforesaid month, before Parw&#299;z
arrived at Burhanpur, a petition came from the Khankhanan and the Amirs
that the Dakhanis had assembled together and were making disturbances.
When I discovered that, notwithstanding the nomination of Parw&#299;z
and the army that had proceeded with him and been appointed to his
service, they were still in need of support and assistance, it occurred
to me that I should go myself, and by Allah&rsquo;s favour satisfy
myself with regard to that affair. In the meanwhile a petition came
also from &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n that my coming there would be
for the advantage of the daily-increasing State. A petition from
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, from Bijapur, also came, that if one
of the trusted ones of the Court could be appointed there to whom he
could tell his desires and claims, so that the envoy might convey them
to me, he hoped that it might become the means of affording profit to
these slaves (i.e. himself). On this account I consulted with the Amirs
and loyal men, and told them to represent whatever entered into
anyone&rsquo;s mind. My son K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n represented that
inasmuch as so many Amirs had been despatched for the conquest of the
Deccan, it was not necessary for me to go in person. If he were
ordered, he himself would go and attend on the prince and would, please
God, perform this duty while serving him. Those words were approved of
by all those who were loyal. I had never contemplated separation from
him, but as the affair was an important one I necessarily gave him
permission, and ordered that as soon as matters had been arranged he
should return without delay, and should not remain more than a year in
those regions. On Tuesday, the 17th Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da, he was
free to go. I presented him with a special gold-embroidered robe of
honour, a special horse with a jewelled saddle, a jewelled sword, and a
special elephant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162"
name="pb162">162</a>]</span>I also gave him a yak-tail standard
(<i>t&#363;m&#257;n &#7789;&#363;g&#863;h</i>). I appointed Fid&#257;;
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of my faithful servants, and to whom I
gave a robe of honour and a horse and his expenses, promoting him to
the rank of 1,000 personal and 400 horse, original and extra, to go
with K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, in order that if it were necessary to
send anyone to &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n according to his
request, he might despatch him. Lank&#363; Pandit, who in the time of
the late king Akbar had come with offerings from &#703;&#256;dil
K&#863;h&#257;n, I also gave leave to go with K&#863;h&#257;n
Jah&#257;n, bestowing on him a horse, a robe of honour, and money. Of
the Amirs and soldiers who had been appointed with &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n to the duty of beating back the R&#257;n&#257;, men
such as R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo, S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n, R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, and others, with 4,000
or 5,000 horse, were nominated to support K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n. I
sent Mu&#703;tamad K&#863;h&#257;n with the announcement that I had
made him a <i>saz&#257;wal</i> (i.e. one who urges on others), and that
he was to act along with K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n in Ujjain. Out of
the men of the palace, I sent 6,000 or 7,000 horse with him, such as
Saif K&#863;h&#257;n B&#257;rha, H&#803;&#257;j&#299; B&#299;
&#362;zbeg, Salamu-llah &#703;Arab, brother&rsquo;s son of Mub&#257;rak
&#703;Arab, who had in his possession the province of
J&#363;tra(?)<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4516src" href="#xd24e4516"
name="xd24e4516src">9</a> and Darf&#363;l(?) and that neighbourhood,
and other mansabdars and courtiers. At the time of giving them leave I
gave each one an increase of rank and robe of honour and money for
their expenses. Making Muh&#803;ammad Beg paymaster of the army, I
provided him with 1,000,000 rupees to take with him. I sent to
Parw&#299;z a special horse, and to the Khankhanan and other Amirs and
officers who were appointed to that Subah dresses of honour.</p>
<p class="par">After carrying out these matters I left the city for the
purpose of hunting. One thousand rupees were given to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>M&#299;r &#703;Al&#299; Akbar. As the
Rab&#299;&#703; Fa&#7779;l (Spring season) had arrived, for fear any
damage should happen to the cultivation of the ryots from the passage
of the army, and notwithstanding that I had appointed a
<i>q&#363;r&#299;s&#257;wul</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e4525src"
href="#xd24e4525" name="xd24e4525src">10</a> (Erskine has Kor, the
Yasawal) (probably a kind of provost marshal) with the band of ahadis
for the purpose of guarding the fields, I ordered certain men to see
what damage had been done to the crops from stage to stage and pay
compensation to the ryots. I gave 10,000 rupees to the daughter of the
Khankhanan, the wife of D&#257;niy&#257;l, 1,000 rupees to
&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m K&#863;har (i.e. ass) for expenses, and
1,000 to Q&#257;ch&#257; the Dakhani. On the 12th, K&#863;h&#257;njar
K&#863;h&#257;n, brother of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, received
the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse original and extra, and
Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n, another brother, that of 600 personal and
300 horse. On this day two antelopes with horns and one doe were taken.
On the 13th I bestowed on and sent to K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n a
special horse. Having promoted Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, son of
M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, to the rank of 1,000 and 500
horse, I gave him 5,000 rupees for expenses, and he was sent off with
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n for service in the Deccan. On this day two
male and three female antelope were killed. On Wednesday, the 10th, I
killed a female <i>n&#299;lg&#257;w</i> and a black antelope with a
gun, and on the 15th a female nilgaw and a <i>chik&#257;ra</i>
(gazelle). On the 17th of the month two rubies and a pearl were brought
to me by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n from Gujarat, as
well as a jewelled opium box, which Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n had sent
from the port of Cambay. On the 20th I killed with a gun a tigress and
a nilgaw. There were two cubs with the tigress, but they disappeared
from view in consequence of the thickness of the jungle and the number
of trees. An order was given that they should search for and bring
them. When I reached the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href=
"#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>halting-place my son K&#863;hurram
brought me one of the cubs, and the next day Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n caught the other and brought it. On the 22nd, when I
had got within shot of a nilgaw, suddenly a groom
(<i>jilaud&#257;r</i>) and two <i>kah&#257;r</i> (bearers) appeared,
and the nilgaw escaped. In a great rage I ordered them to kill the
groom on the spot, and to hamstring<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4552src"
href="#xd24e4552" name="xd24e4552src">11</a> the kahars and mount them
on asses and parade them through the camp, so that no one should again
have the boldness to do such a thing. After this I mounted a horse and
continued hunting with hawks and falcons, and came to the
halting-place.</p>
<p class="par">Next day, under the guidance of Iskandar
Mu&#703;&#299;n, I shot a large nilgaw, and promoted him to the rank of
600 personal and 500 horse. On Friday, the 24th, &#7778;afdar
K&#863;h&#257;n, who had come from the Subah of Behar, had the good
fortune to perform his obeisance to me. He presented as offerings a
hundred muhrs, a sword, and five female and one male elephant. The male
elephant was accepted. On the same day Y&#257;dg&#257;r
K&#863;hw&#257;ja of Samarkand came from Balkh and paid his respects.
He made offerings of an album, some horses, and other presents, and was
dignified with a robe of honour. On Wednesday, 6th
Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja, Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk, who had been removed
from the paymastership of the army against the rebel R&#257;n&#257;,
ill and miserable, waited on me. On the 14th of the said month, having
pardoned all the faults of &#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m
K&#863;har,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4563src" href="#xd24e4563" name=
"xd24e4563src">12</a> I promoted him to the rank of
<i>y&#363;zb&#257;s&#863;h&#299;</i> (centurion) and 20 horse, and
ordered him to go to Kashmir and in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Sal&#257;mu-llah is mentioned later on (p. 78), and is described as
brother&rsquo;s son of Mub&#257;rak, who held the country of Jotra (?)
and Darful. He is also mentioned in the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, p. 38,
where Mub&#257;rak is described as ruler (<i>h&#803;&#257;kim</i>) of
J&#363;yza and Saf&#363;l (?). But a MS. of the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma in
my possession only mentions J&#363;yza or J&#363;yna. I think
J&#363;yza must be Juina or Juanny, which, according to Sir William
Jones, is one of the names of the island of Johanna or Hinzuan (one of
the Comorro Islands), and that Saf&#363;l must be Sofala, a town on the
east coast of Africa. Sir W. Jones was landed on Johanna, and has a
long account of the island (see his works). The Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma
says that Sal&#257;mu-llah killed himself with drink. There is a short
notice of him in the Ma&#702;&#257;s&#804;ir, ii, 641, where he is
called by his title of S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at

Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s conduct was sufficiently brutal, but the

<h2 class="main">The Fifth New Year&rsquo;s Feast from the Auspicious
Accession.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On Sunday, the 24th Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja
(20th March, 1610), after two watches and three gharis the sun entered
into the constellation of Aries, which is the house of honour and good
fortune, and at this auspicious hour the New Year&rsquo;s feast was
arranged at B&#257;k Bhal, one of the villages of the parganah of
B&#257;r&#299;, and according to the rules of my revered father I
mounted the throne. On that morning, which was the New Year&rsquo;s Day
that lighted up the world, and coincided with the 1st of Farward&#299;n
of the 5th year from my accession, I held a public reception, and all
the nobles and servants of the Court had the good fortune to pay their
respects. Some of the nobles&rsquo; offerings were laid before me.
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am gave a pearl worth 4,000 rupees;
Mir&#257;n &#7778;adr Jah&#257;n, twenty-eight hawks and falcons, and
other gifts; Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n, two European boxes, the
sides of which were made with slabs of glass, so that whatever was
placed inside could be seen from outside in a way that you might say
there was nothing between them; Kis&#863;hwar K&#863;h&#257;n,
twenty-two male and female elephants. In the same way each of the
servants of the Court laid before me the presents and offerings that
they had. Na&#7779;ru-llah, son of Fath&#803;u-llah
s&#863;harbatch&#299; (in charge of the <i>s&#863;harbat</i>), was
placed in charge of the offerings. By S&#257;rang Deo, who had been
appointed to carry orders to the victorious army of the Deccan, I sent
souvenirs (<i>tabarruk</i>) to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166"
href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>Parw&#299;z and to each of
the officers. I presented H&#803;us&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n, son of
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4584src" href="#xd24e4584" name="xd24e4584src">1</a>
Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;, who had taken to the ways of a dervish and
seclusion, with 1,000 rupees and a <i>farj&#299;</i> shawl. The day
after the New Year&rsquo;s Day I mounted and started for a tiger-hunt.
Two males and a female were killed. I gave rewards to the ahadis who
had shown bravery and gone in to the tigers, and increased their
monthly pay. On the 26th of the same month I went and busied myself
mostly with hunting nilgaw. As the air was hot and the (propitious)
hour for re-entering Agra had nearly arrived, I went to
R&#363;pb&#257;s, and hunted antelope in that neighbourhood for some
days. On Saturday, the 1st Muh&#803;arram, 1019, R&#363;p
K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779;, who was the founder of
R&#363;pb&#257;s, presented the offering that he had prepared. That
which pleased was accepted and what remained was given him back as a
reward. At the same time B&#257;yaz&#299;d Mankal&#299; and his
brothers, who had come from the Subah of Bengal, were honoured with
paying their respects. Sayyid &#256;dam, son of Sayyid Q&#257;sim
B&#257;rha, who had come from Ahmadabad, also had the same good
fortune. He presented an elephant as an offering. The faujd&#257;rship
of the Subah of Multan was given to Wal&#299; B&#299; &#362;zbeg in
place of T&#257;j K&#863;h&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 3rd Muh&#803;arram of the 5th year, I
halted at the Mand&#257;kar Garden, which is in the neighbourhood of
the city. On the morning on which was the auspicious hour of entry into
the city, after a watch and two gharis had passed I mounted and rode on
a horse to the beginning of the inhabited part, and when I came to the
immediate neighbourhood mounted on an elephant, so that the people from
far and near might see, and scattering money on both sides of the road,
at the hour <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>that the astrologers had chosen, after midday
had passed, entered with congratulation and happiness the royal palace.
In accordance with the usual custom of the New Year I had ordered them
to decorate the palace, which is like the courts of heaven. After
seeing the decorations, K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n laid before me the
offering that he had prepared. Having accepted out of the ornaments and
jewels, dresses and goods, whatever I approved of, I gave the rest as a
reward to him. I had ordered the clerks of the hunting department to
write out (a list of) all the animals that had been killed from the
time of my leaving until I re-entered the city. At this time they
represented that in 56 days 1,362 animals, quadrupeds, and birds had
been killed; the tigers were 7 in number; nilgaw, male and female, 70;
black buck, 51; does and mountain goats and antelope (<i>rojh</i>),
etc., 82; <i>kulang</i> (cranes); peacocks,
<i>surk&#863;h&#257;b</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4603src" href=
"#xd24e4603" name="xd24e4603src">2</a> and other birds, 129; fish,
1,023. On Friday, the 7th, Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n came from the ports
of Cambay and Surat, and had the honour of waiting on me. He had
brought jewels and jewelled things, and vessels of gold and silver made
in Europe, and other beautiful and uncommon presents, male and female
Abyssinian slaves, Arab horses, and things of all kinds that came into
his mind. Thus his presents were laid before me for two and a half
months, and most of them were pleasing to me. On this day &#7778;afdar
K&#863;h&#257;n, who held the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, had
an increase of 500 personal and 200 horse, and was presented with a
standard, and given leave to return to his former jagir. Standards were
also given to Kis&#863;hwar K&#863;h&#257;n and
Far&#299;d&#363;n<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4607src" href="#xd24e4607"
name="xd24e4607src">3</a> K&#863;h&#257;n Barl&#257;s. A fighting
elephant for Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n (Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l&rsquo;s
son) was handed over to his son Bis&#863;h&#363;tan, to take to his
father. I bestowed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168"
name="pb168">168</a>]</span>1,000 rupees on K&#863;hw&#257;ja
H&#803;usain, a descendant of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n Chis&#863;ht&#299;, as was usual for the
half-year. The Khankhanan had sent as an offering a &ldquo;Y&#363;suf
and Zulaik&#863;h&#257;&rdquo; in the handwriting of Mull&#257;
M&#299;r &#703;Al&#299;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4612src" href=
"#xd24e4612" name="xd24e4612src">4</a> with illustrations and in a
beautiful gilt binding, worth 1,000 muhrs. This Ma&#703;&#7779;&#363;m,
his Wakil, brought and submitted. Up to the day of culmination, which
is the conclusion of the New Year&rsquo;s feast, every day many
offerings were laid before me by the Amirs and servants of the Court.
Whichever of the rarities was approved of by me I accepted, and gave
back what was left. On Thursday, the 13th, corresponding to the 19th
Farward&#299;n, which is the day of culmination of the sun and of
gladness and pleasure, I ordered them to prepare an entertainment of
different kinds of intoxicating drinks, and an order was given to the
Amirs and servants of the Court that everyone might choose the kind of
drink he affected. Many took wine and some <i>mufarrih&#803;</i>
(exhilarating drinks), whilst some ate what they wished of the
preparations of opium. The assembly was successfully held.
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n from Gujarat had sent as
an offering a throne of silver, inlaid and painted, of a new fashion
and shape, which was presented to me. A standard was also conferred on
Mah&#257; Singh. In the commencement of my reign I had repeatedly given
orders that no one should make eunuchs or buy or sell them, and whoever
did so would be answerable as a criminal. At this time Afz&#803;al
K&#863;h&#257;n sent some of these evildoers to Court from the Subah of
Behar, who were continually perpetrating this vile offence. I ordered
these unthinking ones (<i>b&#299;-&#703;&#257;qibat&#257;n</i>) to be
imprisoned for life. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169"
name="pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">On the night of the 12th an uncommon and strange event
took place. Some Delhi singers (<i>Qaww&#257;l&#257;n</i>, see Jarrett,
ii, 236) were singing songs in my presence, and Sayyid&#299;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4627src" href="#xd24e4627" name="xd24e4627src">5</a>
S&#863;h&#257;h was, by way of buffoonery, mimicking a religious dance.
This verse of Am&#299;r K&#863;husrau was the refrain
(<i>miy&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;na</i>) of the song&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Each nation has its right road of faith and its
shrine (<i>qibla-g&#257;h&#299;</i>).</p>
<p class="line">I&rsquo;ve set up my shrine (<i>qibla</i>) on the path
of him with the cocked cap.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">I asked what was the real meaning of the (last)
hemistich. Mull&#257; &#703;Al&#299; Ah&#803;mad,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4646src" href="#xd24e4646" name="xd24e4646src">6</a> the seal
engraver, who in his own craft was one of the first of the age, and had
the title of K&#863;hal&#299;fa, and was an old servant, and with whose
father I had learned when I was little, came forward and said, &ldquo;I
have heard from my father that one day S&#863;haik&#863;h
Niz&#804;&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n Auliy&#257; had put his cap on the side of
his head, and was sitting on a terraced roof by the bank of the Jumna
and watching the devotions<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4649src" href=
"#xd24e4649" name="xd24e4649src">7</a> of the Hindus. Just then
Am&#299;r K&#863;husrau appeared, and the S&#863;haik&#863;h turned to
him and said, &lsquo;Do you see this crowd,&rsquo; and then he recited
this line:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Each race has its right road of faith and its
shrine&rsquo; (qibla-g&#257;h&#299;).</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The Am&#299;r, without hesitating, respectfully
did homage to the S&#863;haik&#863;h, and addressing him
said&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve set up my shrine in the direction of
him with the cocked cap.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4660src" href="#xd24e4660" name="xd24e4660src">8</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The aforesaid Mull&#257;, when these words were
uttered, and the last words of the second hemistich passed over his
tongue, became senseless and fell down. Conceiving <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>a
great fear from his falling down, I went to his head. Most of those who
were present doubted whether he had not had an epileptic fit. The
physicians who were present distractedly made inquiry and felt his
pulse and brought medicine. However much they beat their hands and feet
and exerted themselves, he did not come to. Immediately he fell he had
delivered his soul to the Creator. As his body was quite warm, they
thought that possibly some life might be left in him. After a short
time it became evident that the thing was all over and he was dead.
They carried him away dead to his own house. I had never seen this kind
of death, and sent money to his sons for his shroud and burial, and the
next morning they sent him to Delhi and buried him in the burial-place
of his ancestors.</p>
<p class="par">On Friday, the 21st, Kis&#863;hwar K&#863;h&#257;n, who
held the rank of 1,500, was promoted to 2,000 personal and horse, and,
having been presented with an Iraq horse out of my private stable, a
robe of honour and a private elephant, named
Bak&#863;ht-j&#299;t,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4672src" href=
"#xd24e4672" name="xd24e4672src">9</a> and the Faujd&#257;rship of the
country of Uch, was dismissed with a view to the punishment of the
rebels of that region. B&#257;yaz&#299;d Mankal&#299;, having been
honoured with a robe and a horse, was sent off together with his
brothers in the company of Kis&#863;hwar K&#863;h&#257;n. An elephant
from my private stud, by name &#703;&#256;lam-gum&#257;n, was entrusted
to Hab&#299;bu-llah for R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh and sent. A special
horse was sent to Bengal for Kes&#863;ho D&#257;s
M&#257;r&#363;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4678src" href="#xd24e4678"
name="xd24e4678src">10</a> and a female elephant was now given to
&#703;Arab K&#863;h&#257;n, the jagirdar of Jalalabad. At this time
Iftik&#863;har K&#863;h&#257;n had sent an offering of a rare elephant
from Bengal. As I approved of it, it was entered among my private
elephants. I raised the rank of Ah&#803;mad<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4681src" href="#xd24e4681" name="xd24e4681src">11</a> Beg
K&#863;h&#257;n, who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171"
name="pb171">171</a>]</span>had been nominated to the command of the
army of Bangash on account of his good service and that of his sons,
from his original rank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse by 500 more
personal. I sent a gold throne<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4686src"
href="#xd24e4686" name="xd24e4686src">12</a> of jewelled work for
Parw&#299;z, and a <i>sarp&#299;ch</i>, which was of rubies and pearls,
and made at a cost of 2,000 rupees, was sent for K&#863;h&#257;n
Jah&#257;n by the hand of H&#803;ab&#299;b, son of Sarbar&#257;h
K&#863;h&#257;n, to Burhanpur. At this time it became known that
Kaukab, son of Qamar K&#863;h&#257;n, had become intimate with a
Sanyasi, and by degrees his words, which were all blasphemous and
impious, made an impression on that foolish fellow. He had made
&#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f, son of Naq&#299;b K&#863;h&#257;n, and
S&#863;har&#299;f, his cousins, partners in that error. When this
affair was discovered, with only a slight frightening they revealed
certain circumstances with regard to themselves, the relation of which
would be extremely disgusting. Considering their punishment advisable,
I imprisoned Kaukab<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4695src" href=
"#xd24e4695" name="xd24e4695src">13</a> and S&#863;har&#299;f after
giving them a whipping, and ordered &#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f a
hundred lashes in my presence. This special chastisement (was given)
for the purpose of carrying out the Divine law in order that other
ignorant persons might not be disposed towards the same actions. On
Monday, the 24th, Mu&#703;az&#804;z&#804;am K&#863;h&#257;n was
despatched to Delhi to punish the rebels and disaffected of that
neighbourhood. Two thousand rupees were given to
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n Dakhan&#299;. I had ordered
S&#863;haik&#863;h H&#803;usain Dars&#863;han&#299; to proceed with
certain firmans to Bengal and presents to each of the Amirs of that
Subah. I now gave him his orders and despatched him. With an eye on his
actions and his approved services, I promoted Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n to the rank of 5,000 personal and horse, and bestowed
on him a special dress of honour. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172"
href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>I gave a special dress of
honour also to Kis&#863;hwar K&#863;h&#257;n, and presented R&#257;ja
Kaly&#257;n with an Iraq horse, and similarly to the other Amirs there
were given robes of honour or horses. Far&#299;d&#363;n Barl&#257;s,
who held the rank of 1,500 personal and 1,300 horse, I promoted to
2,000 personal and 1,500 horse.</p>
<p class="par">On the night of Monday, the 1st &#7778;afar, through the
carelessness of the servants, a great fire occurred in the house of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan, and before they became aware
of it and the fire could be put out many of his properties were burnt.
In order to afford consolation to the mind of the K&#863;hw&#257;ja and
to make up for the loss he had sustained, I gave him 40,000 rupees. On
Saif K&#863;h&#257;n B&#257;rha, who had been cherished and brought up
by me, I bestowed a standard. I increased the rank of
Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk, who had been appointed to the Diwanship of Kabul,
from his original of 1,000 personal and 225 horse by 200 personal and
275 horse, and dismissed him. The next day I sent a
<i>ph&#363;l-ka&#7789;&#257;ra</i> (dagger) studded with valuable
jewels to Burhanpur to K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">A widow woman complained that Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n
had taken her daughter by force in the port of Cambay, and after some
while, during which he had kept her in his own house, when she enquired
for the girl had said that she had died by an unavoidable death. I
ordered an enquiry to be made into the affair. After much search I
discovered that one of his attendants had been guilty of this outrage,
and had him put to death, and reduced Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s
mansab by one half, and made an allowance to the woman who had been
thus injured.</p>
<p class="par">As on Sunday, the 7th of the month, a
<i>qir&#257;n-i-nah&#803;s&#299;n</i> (an unlucky conjunction) had
occurred, I gave alms of gold and silver and other metals, and
different kinds of cereals, to faqirs and indigent people to be divided
in most parts of the dominion. On the night of Monday, the 8th, having
sent for S&#863;haik&#863;h H&#803;usain Sirhind&#299; and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>S&#863;haik&#863;h Mu&#7779;t&#804;af&#257;, who
were celebrated for the adoption of the ways of dervishdom and the
state of poverty, a party was held, and by degrees the assembly engaged
warmly in <i>sam&#257;&#703;</i> and <i>wajd</i> (dervish dancing and
ecstasy). Hilarity and frenzy were not wanting. After the meeting was
over I gave money to each and gave him leave. As M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; Beg Tark&#863;h&#257;n repeatedly made
representations with regard to provisions for Qandahar and the monthly
pay of the musketeers of the said fort, I ordered 200,000 rupees to be
sent there from the treasury of Lahore.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4721src" href="#xd24e4721" name="xd24e4721src">14</a></p>
<p class="par">On the 19th Urdibihis&#863;ht, in the fifth year of my
reign, corresponding with the 4th &#7778;afar, there occurred a strange
affair at Patna, which is the seat of government of the province of
Behar. Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of the Subah, went off
to the jagir to which he had just been appointed, and which was at a
distance of 60 kos from Patna, and handed over the fort and the city to
the charge of S&#863;haik&#863;h Ban&#257;ras&#299; and
G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804; Zain-k&#863;h&#257;n&#299;, the Diwan of the
Subah, and to a number of other mansabdars. With the idea that there
were no enemies in that region he did not satisfy himself as he should
have with regard to the protection of the fort and city. By chance, at
that time an unknown man of the name of Qut&#804;b belonging to the
people of Uch, who was a mischievous and seditious fellow, came to the
province of Ujjainiyya,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4726src" href=
"#xd24e4726" name="xd24e4726src">15</a> which is in the neighbourhood
of Patna, with the look of a dervish and the clothes of a beggar, and
having made acquaintance with men of that part, who were always
seditious, represented to them that he was K&#863;husrau, who had
escaped from prison and conveyed himself there; saying that if they
would accompany and assist him, after the affair had been completed
they would be the ministers of his State. In <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>short, deceiving those simpletons with foolish
words he brought them over to him and persuaded them that he was
K&#863;husrau. He showed those deceived ones the parts about his eyes,
where at some time he had produced scars, of which the marks were still
apparent, and told them that in the prison they had fastened cups
(<i>ka&#7789;or&#299;</i>) on them and those were the marks.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4734src" href="#xd24e4734" name=
"xd24e4734src">16</a> Through these falsehoods and deceit a number of
foot- and horsemen had collected round him, and had obtained
information that Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n was not at Patna.
Considering this a great opportunity, they made a raid, and when two or
three hours of the day had passed on Sunday came to the city, and being
hindered by nothing went for the fort. S&#863;haik&#863;h
Ban&#257;ras&#299;, who was in the fort, obtaining news of this, went
in a disturbed state to the gate of the fort. The enemy, who came on
with speed, did not give him time to close the gate of the fort.
Together with G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;, he betook himself to the side of
the river by a wicket gate, and procuring a boat proposed to go to
Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n. Those rebels came with ease into the fort
and took possession of Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s property and
the royal treasury; and some of those wretched creatures who wait on
events, who were in the city and its neighbourhood, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>joined them. This news reached Afz&#803;al
K&#863;h&#257;n at Gorakhpur (K&#863;harakp&#363;r),<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e4743src" href="#xd24e4743" name="xd24e4743src">17</a> and
S&#863;haik&#863;h Ban&#257;ras&#299; and G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804; also
came to him there by way of the river. Letters came from the city that
this wretch, who called himself K&#863;husrau, was in reality not
K&#863;husrau. Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n, placing his trust on the
grace and mercy of Allah, and through my good fortune, started without
delay against those rebels. In five days he reached the neighbourhood
of Patna. When the news of Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s coming
reached those scoundrels, they entrusted the fort to one of those whom
they had confidence in, and the horse and foot arraying themselves went
out for four kos to meet Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n. A fight took
place on the bank of the river P&#363;n P&#363;n, and after a slight
skirmish the array of those ill-fated ones was broken and they became
scattered. In great bewilderment a second time that wretch was coming
into the fort with a few men. Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n followed him,
and did not allow them to close the gate of the fort. Going to
Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s house in a state of confusion, they
fortified the house and remained there for three watches, and fought.
They wounded about thirty people with arrows. After his companions had
gone to <i>jahannam</i> (hell) he himself became helpless, and asked
for quarter, and waited upon Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n. In order to
put a stop to this affair, Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n executed him on
the same day, and imprisoned some of his companions who had fallen
alive into his hand. These items of news one after another reached the
royal ear. I summoned to Agra S&#863;haik&#863;h Ban&#257;ras&#299; and
G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804; Zain-k&#863;h&#257;n&#299; and the other
mansabdars who had made default in holding the fort and protecting the
city, and ordered their hair and beards <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>to be cut off, and
that they should be clothed in women&rsquo;s clothes, seated on asses,
and paraded round the city of Agra and in the bazars, as a warning and
example to others.</p>
<p class="par">At this time representations succeeded each other from
Parw&#299;z and the Amirs appointed to the Deccan and those who were
well-wishers of the State, that &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n
B&#299;j&#257;p&#363;r&#299; prayed that they would send to him
M&#299;r Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain Inj&#363;, on whose words
and acts all the rulers of the Deccan had great reliance, that he might
associate himself with them and dispel the fear in their minds, and the
affairs of that place might be arranged as it might seem proper to
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, who had chosen the way of loyalty and
service. In any case, he might drive out of their minds the fear that
was in them, and soothing them might give him hopes of the royal
favour. In order to obtain this end, on the 16th of the same month I
despatched the above-mentioned M&#299;r, giving him a present of 10,000
rupees. I increased the former rank of Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n,
which was 1,000 personal and 500 horse, by 500 personal and horse, in
order that he might go to the support of his brother Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n in Bengal. At the same time, in order to punish
Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, Zamindar of the province
B&#257;ndh&#363;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4753src" href="#xd24e4753"
name="xd24e4753src">18</a> who had withdrawn his foot from the circle
of obedience and service, I appointed Mah&#257; Singh, grandson of
R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh, to proceed to put down the disaffection in
that region and at the same time administer the estate of the jagir of
the Raja, which was in that neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="par">On the 20th of the month I gave an elephant to
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n Dakhan&#299;. As the governor
of Jalalabad had written and represented the ruinous state of the fort
of that place, I ordered what might be required for the repair of the
said fort to be taken from the treasury of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>Lahore. Iftik&#863;h&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n had
done approved service in Bengal. On the request of the governor of that
Subah I increased his original rank, which was 1,500, by 500. On the
28th a representation came from &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
F&#299;r&#363;z-jang, containing recommendations in favour of some of
the zealous servants who had been sent with him to subdue the rebel
R&#257;n&#257;. As G&#863;hazn&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n J&#257;lwar&#299;
had shown the greatest zeal of all in this service, I increased by 500
personal and 400 horse his former rank, which was 1,500 personal and
300 horse. In the same manner each one of those persons was promoted
according to his services.</p>
<p class="par">Daulat K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been sent to Allahabad
to bring the throne of black stone, came on Wednesday, the 4th of the
month of Mihr (15th September, 1610), and had an audience and brought
the stone safe and sound. In truth it was a wonderful slab, very black
and shining. Many say it is of a species of touchstone; in length it
was one-eighth less than four cubits, and in breadth 2&frac12; cubits
and one <i>tas&#363;</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4765src" href=
"#xd24e4765" name="xd24e4765src">19</a> whilst its thickness may be
three <i>tas&#363;</i>. I ordered stone-cutters to carve suitable
couplets on the sides of it. They had attached feet to it of the same
kind of stone. I often sat on that throne.</p>
<p class="par">As the brothers of K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam
became security for him, I brought out of prison
&#703;Abdu-s-Subh&#803;&#257;n K&#863;h&#257;n, who was in confinement
for certain offences, and promoted him to the rank of 1,000 personal
and 400 horse, and appointed him to the faujd&#257;rship of the Subah
of Allahabad, and gave him the jagir of Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n, the
brother of Isl&#257;m <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href=
"#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>K&#863;h&#257;n. I sent Tarbiyat
K&#863;h&#257;n to the faujd&#257;rship of the Sarkar of Alwar. On the
12th of the same month a representation arrived from K&#863;h&#257;n
Jah&#257;n that the Khankhanan, according to my order, had started for
the Court in company with Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n, and that
M&#299;r Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain, who had been nominated by
the Court to go to Bijapur, had also gone from Burhanpur, together with
the wakils of &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, to Bijapur. On the 21st
of the same month I promoted Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n to the
subadarship of the Panjab, which is one of the largest charges in my
dominions, and gave him a special shawl. Having appointed T&#257;j
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was in the Subah of Multan to the governorship of
Kabul, I added 500 horse to the rank of 3,000 personal and 1,500 horse
already held by him. At the request of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
F&#299;r&#363;z-jang, the son of R&#257;n&#257; Shankar was also
promoted in rank. When Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been sent
to Burhanpur to ascertain the numbers of the forces of the Amirs
appointed to the Deccan, and to bring the Khankhanan, arrived in the
neighbourhood of Agra, he left the Khankhanan some stages off the city
and came on in front himself, and was honoured with the good fortune of
paying his respects and kissing the threshold. After a few days, on the
12th &#256;b&#257;n, the Khankhanan came and waited on me. As many of
those who were loyal had represented the state of his affairs whether
true or false, according to their ideas, and I was displeased with him,
because the degree of favour and regard that I previously had observed
in his case and that I had seen in my revered father had not produced
its effect, I did justice in the matter, for previously to this a
letter of appointment to the service of the Deccan for a certain time
had been given to him, and he had proceeded there in attendance on
Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z with other nobles for that important
matter. After he arrived at Burhanpur he had not looked to the
opportuneness of the time, and at an <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb179" href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>improper season for
moving, and when forage and other necessaries had not been laid in, he
had taken Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z and his forces above the Ghats,
and by degrees, in consequence of want of concert among the Sardars and
his treachery, and of conflicting opinions, things had come to such a
pass that grain was obtained with difficulty, and not a <i>m&#257;n</i>
was to be got for large sums of money. The affairs of the army became
so confused that nothing went on properly, and horses, camels, and
other four-footed beasts died. In consequence of the exigency of the
time he had patched up a kind of peace with the enemy and withdrawn
Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z and the army to Burhanpur. As this
business did not turn out well, all the well-wishers of the State knew
that this division (of counsels) and confusion had arisen from
treachery and want of arrangement of the Khankhanan, and represented
this to the Court. Although this appeared altogether incredible, at
last this impression was left upon my mind, and a representation came
from K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n to the effect that all this mischief
and confusion had arisen through the treachery of the Khankhanan;
either this service should be left entirely in his control, or,
summoning him to Court, I should appoint to this duty this man whom I
had myself cherished and brought up, and appoint 30,000 horse to
support this slave (K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n himself), in order that
in the space of two years, having freed the whole of the royal
province, now in the possession of the enemy, and having brought the
fort of Qandahar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4786src" href="#xd24e4786"
name="xd24e4786src">20</a> and other forts on the border into the
occupation of the servants of the Court, he should include in the royal
dominions the province of Bijapur. If he did not complete this service
in that time, he might be debarred from the good fortune of paying his
respects (to me) and would not show his face to the servants of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>the Court. When the relations between the
Sardars and the Khankhanan reached this point, I did not consider it
advisable for him to be there any longer, and handed over the command
to K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n and sent for him to Court. In reality the
cause of my disinclination and want of favour to him was this. The
degree of inclination and disinclination towards him in future will be
in accordance with whatever may become clear.</p>
<p class="par">I favoured and promoted Sayyid &#703;Al&#299;
B&#257;rha, who is one of our distinguished young men, with an increase
of 500 personal and 200 horse beyond his previous rank, which was 1,000
personal and 500 horse, and gave D&#257;r&#257;b K&#863;h&#257;n, son
of the Khankhanan, the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, with the
Sarkar of Ghazipur as his jagir. Previously to this I had had the
daughter of M&#299;rz&#257; Muz&#804;affar H&#803;usain, son of
Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain M&#299;rz&#257; &#7778;afaw&#299;, ruler
of Qandahar, betrothed to my son Sult&#804;&#257;n K&#863;hurram, and
on this date, the 17th &#256;b&#257;n, as the marriage meeting had been
arranged, I went to the house of B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram and
passed the night there. I presented most of the Amirs with robes of
honour. Some of those confined in the fort of Gwalior I released, and
especially H&#803;&#257;j&#299; M&#299;rak. Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n
had collected 100,000 rupees from the <i>k&#863;h&#257;li&#7779;a</i>
(directly managed) parganahs. As he was at the head of the army and the
service, I handed this over to him as a present. Giving a little gold
and silver and some of every kind of jewellery and grain to trustworthy
men, I determined that they should distribute them to the poor of Agra.
On the same day a report came from K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n that
&#298;raj, the son of the Khankhanan, had obtained leave from the
prince, and according to orders he had despatched him to Court. With
regard to what had been ordered in the case of Ab&#363;-l-fath&#803;,
of Bijapur, as the above-mentioned was an experienced man, and his
being sent would cause despair to the other Sardars of the Deccan to
whom promises had been made, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181"
href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>had (therefore) kept him
under surveillance.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4798src" href=
"#xd24e4798" name="xd24e4798src">21</a> An order had been sent that as
Kes&#863;ho D&#257;s, the son of R&#257;y Kalah(?), was in the service
of Parw&#299;z, if any impediment should occur in sending him, he
(K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n) should despatch him whether he wished it
or not. Immediately on this becoming known to Parw&#299;z, he gave him
leave and said to K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n: &ldquo;These few words
from my mouth thou wilt represent, that as I would give my existence
and life for the service of my visible God (Jah&#257;ng&#299;r), what
is there in the being or annihilation of Kes&#863;ho D&#257;s<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4801src" href="#xd24e4801" name=
"xd24e4801src">22</a> that I should show any resistance in sending him?
When they (i.e. the king) send for my confidential servants for any
reason it produces a feeling of hopelessness and disquietude of mind in
the rest, and becoming known in these regions gives an idea of
disfavour on the part of our lord and Qibla (place looked towards in
worship). As for the rest, it is His Majesty&rsquo;s order.&rdquo; From
the date on which the fort of Ahmadnagar, by the efforts of my deceased
brother D&#257;niy&#257;l, came into the possession of the heads of the
victorious State, up till now, the guardianship and preservation of
that place had been entrusted to K&#863;hw&#257;ja Beg M&#299;rz&#257;
&#7778;afaw&#299;, who was a relative of the asylum of pardon
S&#863;h&#257;h T&#804;ahm&#257;sp. After the disturbance of the rebel
Deccanis went to a great length, and they besieged the said fort, he
had committed no fault in the duties of devotedness and holding of the
fort. When the Khankhanan and the Amirs and other leaders who had
assembled at Burhanpur in waiting on Parw&#299;z devoted themselves to
the driving back and defeat of the rebels, and from the differences of
opinion and quarrels of the Amirs, and the absence of provision of
forage and grain, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182"
name="pb182">182</a>]</span>those who looked after matters of
importance brought this large army into improper roads and among hills
and difficult passes, they in a short space of time rendered it
wretched and impotent, and matters had come to such a pass and the
difficulty with regard to grain was such that they were giving a life
for a loaf. They then turned back helplessly with their objects
unfulfilled. The garrison of the fort, who were expecting aid from this
army, on hearing this news, lost heart and stability, and tumultuously
wished to vacate the fort at once. When K&#863;hw&#257;ja Beg
M&#299;rz&#257; became aware of this he endeavoured to soothe and quiet
the men, but though he did his best it had no good result. At last,
under an agreement, he vacated the fort, and proceeded to Burhanpur,
and on the day mentioned waited on the prince. Representations with
regard to his coming reached me, and, as it was clear that he had not
been wanting in bravery and loyalty, I ordered his rank of 5,000
personal and horse to be confirmed and a jagir to be given him. On the
9th a petition came from some of the Amirs in the Deccan that on the
22nd S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n M&#299;r Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n
H&#803;usain had gone to Bijapur. &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n sent
his wakil forward for 20 kos, and himself received him at a distance of
3 kos, and took the M&#299;r by the same road to his own residence.</p>
<p class="par">As the desire to hunt overcame me, at a propitious hour
determined by the astrologers, when a watch and six gharis had passed
on the night of Friday, the 15th Ramaz&#803;&#257;n, corresponding with
the 10th &#256;z&#817;ar in the 5th year (of my reign), I started to
hunt, and made my first halt in the Dahrah Garden, which is near the
city. At this stage I gave M&#299;r &#703;Al&#299; Akbar leave to go
into the city after bestowing on him 2,000 rupees and a special warm
wrapper (<i>fargul</i>). In order that the grain and cultivation should
not be trodden down by my men I ordered that all should remain in the
city but the men who were actually wanted and my personal servants.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>Having entrusted the charge of the city to
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n I gave him his leave. On the 14th
Sa&#703;du-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Sa&#703;&#299;d
K&#863;h&#257;n, was given an elephant. On the 28th, corresponding with
the 21st Ramaz&#803;&#257;n, forty-four elephants, which
H&#257;s&#863;him K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n,
had sent as an offering from Orissa, were produced before me. Of these
one was very good and tame; this one I put in my private stud. On the
28th an eclipse (of the sun, <i>kus&#363;f</i>) took place, in order to
do away with the unluckiness of which I weighed myself against gold and
silver; it came to 1,800 tolas of gold and 4,900 rupees. This, along
with several kinds of vegetables and sorts of animals such as elephants
and horses and cattle, I ordered to be divided among deserving people
who were unprovided for and helpless poor of the city of Agra and other
cities in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="par">As the affairs of the army which had been nominated for
the subjugation of the Deccan under the command of Parw&#299;z, and
leadership of the Khankhanan and other high Amirs such as R&#257;ja
M&#257;n Singh, K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n, the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257;, and other mansabdars, and
other leaders of every tribe and condition, had ended in this, that
they had turned back from half-way and returned to Burhanpur, and all
the confidential servants and news-writers who spoke the truth had sent
in reports to the Court, that although there were many causes for the
ruin of this army, yet the chief reason was the disagreement of the
Amirs, especially the treachery of the Khankhanan, it came into my mind
that I must send K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am with another fresh
and powerful army to make amends for and set to rights some of the
improper proceedings that had arisen from the disagreement of the Amirs
that has been described. On the 11th of Day he (K&#863;h&#257;n
A&#703;z&#804;am) was honoured with the charge of this duty, and an
order was given to the Diwans to make preparations and send him off
quickly. I appointed K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, Far&#299;d&#363;n
K&#863;h&#257;n <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184"
name="pb184">184</a>]</span>Barl&#257;s, Y&#363;suf K&#863;h&#257;n,
son of H&#803;usain K&#863;h&#257;n Tukriyah, &#703;Al&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n Niy&#257;z&#299;, B&#257;z Bah&#257;dur Qalm&#257;q,
and other mansabdars, near to the number of 10,000 horse, to accompany
him. It was settled that in addition to the ahadis who were appointed
to this duty 2,000 others should accompany him, making altogether
12,000 horse. Having sent with him thirty lakhs of rupees and several
elephants, I gave him his leave and presented him with a magnificent
dress of honour, a jewelled sword-belt, a horse with a jewelled
saddle<span class="corr" id="xd24e4820" title="Not in source">,</span>
a private elephant, and 500,000 rupees for expenses. An order was given
that the chiefs of the civil department should recover this from his
jagir. The Amirs who were under his orders were honoured with robes of
honour, horses, and presents. I increased by 500 more horse the rank
held by Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n, of 4,000 personal and 3,000
horse, and ordered him to conduct K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am and
this army to Burhanpur, and having enquired into (the circumstances of)
the destruction of the army, should give the order of the appointment
of the K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am to the Amirs of those regions
and make them of one purpose and counsel with him. He was to see the
state of preparation of the army of those parts, and after arranging
all matters should bring the Khankhanan with him to Court. On Sunday,
the 4th S&#863;hawwal, when near the end of the day, I engaged in a
cheetah hunt. I had determined that on this day and Thursdays no
animals should be killed and I would eat no meat, on Sunday especially
because of the respect my revered father had for that day in not being
inclined to eat flesh on it, and in forbidding the killing of any
animals for the reason that on the night of Sunday his own honoured
birth had taken place. He used to say it was better on that day that
all animals should be free from the calamity of those of a butcherly
disposition. Thursday is the day of my accession. On that day also I
ordered that animals should not be killed, so that whilst sporting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>I should not shoot an arrow or a gun at wild
animals. In hunting with cheetahs An&#363;p R&#257;y, who is one of my
close attendants, was heading the men who were with him in the hunt at
a little distance<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4825src" href="#xd24e4825"
name="xd24e4825src">23</a> from me and came to a tree on which some
kites were sitting. When his sight fell on those kites he took a bow
and some pointless arrows (<i>tukk&#257;</i>) and went towards them. By
chance in the neighbourhood of that tree he saw a half-eaten bullock.
Near it a huge, powerful tiger got up out of a clump that was near and
went off. Though not more than two gharis of day remained, as he knew
my liking for tiger-hunting, he and some of those who were with him
surrounded the tiger and sent some one to me to give me the news. When
it reached me I rode there at once in a state of excitement and at full
speed, and B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram, R&#257;m D&#257;s,
I&#703;tim&#257;d R&#257;y, H&#803;ay&#257;t K&#863;h&#257;n, and one
or two others went with me. On arriving I saw the tiger standing in the
shade of a tree, and wished to fire at him from horseback but found
that my horse was unsteady, and dismounted and aimed and fired my gun.
As I was standing on a height and the tiger below, I did not know
whether it had struck him or not. In a moment of excitement I fired the
gun again, and I think that this time I hit him. The tiger rose and
charged, and wounding the chief huntsman, who had a falcon on his wrist
and happened to be in front of him, sat down again in his own place. In
this state of affairs, placing another gun on a tripod,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4843src" href="#xd24e4843" name=
"xd24e4843src">24</a> I took aim (<i>majr&#257; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=

href="#xd24e4853" name="xd24e4853src">25</a>). An&#363;p R&#257;y stood
holding the rest, and had a sword in his belt and a baton
(<i>kutaka</i>) in his hand. B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram was a short
distance off to my left, and R&#257;m D&#257;s and other servants
behind him. Kam&#257;l the huntsman (<i>qar&#257;wul</i>) loaded the
gun and placed it in my hand. When I was about to fire, the tiger came
roaring towards us and charged. I immediately fired. The ball passed
through the tiger&rsquo;s mouth and teeth. The noise of the gun made
him very savage, and the servants who had crowded together could not
stand his charge and fell over one another, so that I, through their
pushing and shock, was moved a couple of paces from my place and fell
down. In fact, I am sure that two or three of them placed their feet on
my chest and passed over me. I&#703;tim&#257;d R&#257;y and the
huntsman Kam&#257;l assisting me, I stood up. At this moment the tiger
made for those who were on the left-hand side. An&#363;p R&#257;y let
the rest slip out of his hand and turned towards the tiger. The tiger,
with the same activity with which he had charged, turned on him, and he
manfully faced him, and struck him twice with both hands on the head
with the stick he had in his hand. The tiger, opening his mouth, seized
both of An&#363;p R&#257;y&rsquo;s arms with it, and bit them so that
his teeth passed through both, but the stick and the bracelets on his
arms were helpful, and did not allow his arms to be destroyed. From the
attack and pushing of the tiger An&#363;p R&#257;y fell down between
the tiger&rsquo;s fore-feet, so that his head and face were opposite
the tiger&rsquo;s chest. At this moment B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram
and R&#257;m D&#257;s came up to the assistance of An&#363;p R&#257;y.
The prince struck the tiger on the loins with his sword, and R&#257;m
D&#257;s also struck him twice with his sword, once on the
shoulder-blade. On the whole it was very warm work, and
H&#803;ay&#257;t K&#863;h&#257;n struck the tiger several blows over
the head with a stick he had in his hand. An&#363;p R&#257;y with force
dragged his arms out of the tiger&rsquo;s mouth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>and
struck him two or three times on the cheek with his fist, and rolling
over on his side stood up by the force of his knees. At the time of
withdrawing his arms from the tiger&rsquo;s mouth, as his teeth had
passed through them, they were partly torn, and both his paws passed
over his shoulders. When he stood up, the tiger also stood up and
wounded him on the chest with his claws, so that those wounds troubled
him for some days. As the ground was uneven, they rolled over each
other, holding on like two wrestlers. In the place where I was standing
the ground was quite level. An&#363;p R&#257;y says that God Almighty
gave him so much intelligence that he bore the tiger over deliberately
to<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4870src" href="#xd24e4870" name=
"xd24e4870src">26</a> one side (in the original, that side), and that
he knew no more. At this time the tiger left him and was making off. He
in that state of bewilderment raised up his sword and followed him and
struck him on the head. When the tiger turned his face round, he struck
him another blow on the face, so that both his eyes were cut, and the
skin of the eyebrows, which had been severed by the sword, fell over
his eyes. In this state of affairs, a lamp-man of the name of
&#7778;&#257;lih&#803;, as it was time to light the lamps, came in a
hurry and by a blind chance<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4873src" href=
"#xd24e4873" name="xd24e4873src">27</a> came across the tiger. The
tiger struck him one blow with his paw and knocked him down. To fall
and give up his life were the same thing. Other people came in and
finished the tiger&rsquo;s business. As An&#363;p R&#257;y had done
this service to me and I had witnessed the way in which he offered his
life, after he had recovered from the pain of his wounds and had the
honour of waiting on me, I bestowed on him the title of
An&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href=
"#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>Singh-dalan.
An&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4883src" href=
"#xd24e4883" name="xd24e4883src">28</a> they call in the Hindi language
the leader of an army, and the meaning of Singh-dalan is a
tiger-slayer. Giving him a special sword of my own, I increased his
mansab. I gave K&#863;hurram, son of K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am,
who had been appointed to the governorship of the province of Junagadh,
the title of K&#257;mil K&#863;h&#257;n. On Sunday, the 3rd
Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da, I employed myself in fishing, and 766 fish
were caught; these were divided in my presence among the Amirs,
<i>Ibachki&#257;n</i> (?),<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4889src" href=
"#xd24e4889" name="xd24e4889src">29</a> and most of the servants. I eat
no fish but those that have scales, but not because the professors of
the Shiah faith look on those without scales as unlawful, but the cause
of my aversion is this, that I have heard from old men, and it has
become known to me by experience as well, that fish without scales eat
the flesh of dead animals and fish with scales do not eat it. From this
cause, to eat them is contrary to my disposition. The Shiahs
know<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4902src" href="#xd24e4902" name=
"xd24e4902src">30</a> why they do not eat them and for what reason they
consider them unlawful. One of my home-bred camels that was with me in
the hunt carried five nilgaws that weighed 42 Hindustani maunds. I had
before this sent for Naz&#804;&#299;r&#299; of N&#299;sh&#257;p&#363;r,
who excelled other men in the art of poetry, and passed his time in
Gujarat as a merchant. At this time he came and waited on me, and
imitating a poem of Anwar&#299;,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Again, what youth and beauty this is for the
world!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first xd24e4909">laid before me a poem that he had
composed on me. I presented him with 1,000 rupees, a horse, and a robe
of honour as a gift for this poem. I had also sent for H&#803;ak&#299;m
Ham&#299;d Gujar&#257;t&#299;, whom Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n
greatly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>praised, and he came and waited on me. His good
qualities and purity were better than his doctoring. He waited on me
for some time. When it became known that there was no physician but
himself in Gujarat, and I found he himself desired leave to go, I gave
him and his sons 1,000 rupees and some shawls, and set aside a whole
village for his maintenance; he went off to his native place quite
happy. Y&#363;suf K&#863;h&#257;n, son of H&#803;usain K&#863;h&#257;n
Tukriyah, came from his jagir and waited on me. On Thursday, the 10th
Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja, was the festival of the Qurb&#257;n (the
sacrifice of Ishmael). As it is forbidden to take life on that day
(Thursday), I ordered that on the Friday they should kill the
sacrificial animals. Having sacrificed three sheep with my own hand, I
mounted to go hunting, and returned when six gharis of night had
passed. On this day was killed a nilgaw (commonly called blue bull) of
the weight of 9 maunds and 35 seers. The story of this nilgaw is
written because it is not devoid of strangeness. In the two past years,
during which I had come to this same place to wander about and hunt I
had shot at him each time with a gun. As the wounds were not in a fatal
place, he had not fallen, but gone off. This time again I saw that
nilgaw in the hunting-ground (<i>s&#863;hik&#257;rg&#257;h</i>), and
the watchman recognized that in the two previous years he had gone away
wounded. In short, I fired at him again three times on that day. It was
in vain. I pursued him rapidly on foot for three kos, but however much
I exerted myself I could not catch him. At last I made a vow that if
this nilgaw fell I would have his flesh cooked, and for the soul of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n would give it to eat to
poor people. I also vowed a muhr and one rupee to my revered father.
Soon after this the nilgaw became worn out with moving, and I ran to
his head and ordered them to make it lawful (cut its throat in the name
of Allah) on the spot, and having brought it to the camp I fulfilled my
vow as I had proposed. They cooked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190"
href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>the nilgaw, and expending the
muhr and rupee on sweets. I assembled poor and hungry people and
divided them among them in my own presence. Two or three days
afterwards I saw another nilgaw. However much I exerted myself and
wished he would stand still in one place, so that I might fire at him,
I could get no chance. With my gun on my shoulder I followed him till
near evening until it was sunset, and despaired of killing him.
Suddenly it came across my tongue, &ldquo;K&#863;hw&#257;ja, this
nilgaw also is vowed to you.&rdquo; My speaking and his sitting down
were at one and the same moment. I fired at and hit him, and ordered
him, like the first nilgaw, to be cooked and given to the poor to eat.
On Saturday, the 19th Z&#817;&#299;-l-h&#803;ijja, I fished again. This
time about 330 fish were caught. On the night of Wednesday, the
28th<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4918src" href="#xd24e4918" name=
"xd24e4918src">31</a> of the same month, I encamped at
R&#363;pb&#257;s. As this was one of my fixed hunting-places and there
was an order that no one should hunt in the neighbourhood, a great
number of antelope had come together in the desert there, so much so
that they came into the inhabited parts and were not subject to any
kind of molestation. I hunted for two or three days in those desert
plains, and shot, and hunted with cheetahs many antelopes. As the hour
for entering the city was near, making two halts on the way, I alighted
on the night of Thursday, the 2nd Muharram, in the year 1020 (17th
March, 1611), at the garden of &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q
Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299;, which is near, in fact close to, the city. On
this night many of the servants of the Court, such as K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Jah&#257;n, Daulat K&#863;h&#257;n, and a number who had remained in
the city, came and waited on me. &#298;raj also, whom I had sent for
from the Subah of the Deccan, had the honour of kissing the threshold.
I stayed in that garden also on the Friday. On that day
&#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q presented his own offerings. As this was the
last day for hunting, an order was given <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>that the duration of
the hunt and the number of animals killed should be counted up to me.
The time of the hunt was from the 9th of the month of &#256;z&#817;ar
to the 29th Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817; of the 5th year, or three months and
twenty days. In this time tigers 12, deer (<i>g&#257;wzan</i>) 1,
<i>chik&#257;rah</i> (gazelle) 44, <i>k&#363;t&#257;h-p&#257;cha</i>
(hog-deer) 1 head, fawns 2 head, black buck 68 head, does 31 head,
foxes 4, <i>k&#363;r&#257;ra</i> deer 8, <i>p&#257;tal</i> (?) 1, bears
5, hy&aelig;nas 3, hares 6, nilgaw 108, fish 1,096, eagle 1, bustard 1,
peafowl 5, herons 5, partridges 5, brahmin&#299; ducks
(<i>surk&#863;h&#257;b</i>) 1, <i>s&#257;ras</i> 5, <i>dh&#299;k</i>
(?) 1; total, 1,414.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 29th Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;,
corresponding to the 4th Muh&#803;arram, I mounted an elephant and went
to the city. From the garden of &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q to the palace
the distance is a kos and 20 <i>tan&#257;b</i>. I scattered 1,500
rupees to the crowd. At the fixed hour I entered the palace. The bazars
had been decorated with cloths after the manner of the New Year&rsquo;s
feast. As at the hunting-time an order had been given to
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n to prepare in the <i>Mah&#803;all</i>
(Zenanah) a building fit for me to sit in, the said K&#863;hw&#257;ja
had in the space of three months prepared and brought to perfection
this kind of lofty building, and with folded hands (in humility) had
done exceedingly active work. Coming off the dust of the road I entered
that Paradise-like building and went to look round that abode, and it
was very much to my taste. K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n was dignified
with much praise and commendation. The offerings he had prepared were
displayed to me in the same building. Some of these were approved and
accepted and the remainder presented to him.</p>

Apparently we may infer from this that Jah&#257;ng&#299;r did blind or
attempt to blind his son K&#863;husrau, though he says nothing about
it. Else why should this impostor pretend that he had marks of the
blinding? Tavernier says K&#863;husrau was blinded. Du Jarric also
tells us that Jah&#257;ng&#299;r blinded K&#863;husrau on his way back
from Kabul, when he came to the place where K&#863;husrau had fought
the battle. He was blinded by some juice of a plant being poured into
his eyes. The juice resembled milk (qu. <i>Euphorbia</i>). One of his
captains, who was also a judge, was likewise blinded there along with
his son. W. Finch, too, speaks of this outbreak. He also says that
K&#863;husrau was reported to have been blinded on the battlefield with
a glass. Another story was that Jah&#257;ng&#299;r merely caused a
handkerchief to be tied over his eyes and had it sealed with his own
seal. It is mentioned in Whiteway&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rise of the Portuguese
Power in India,&rdquo; p. 165, note, that fifteen relatives of the King
of Ormuz had been blinded by red-hot bowls having been passed close to
their eyes.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd24e4734src">&uarr;</a></p>

<h2 class="main">The Sixth New Year&rsquo;s Feast after my auspicious
Accession.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Two gharis and forty seconds of day had passed on
the Monday when the sun (lit. his honour the greatest star) entered his
tower of honour, which is in the constellation of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>Aries. That day was the 1st Farward&#299;n,
corresponding with the 6th Muh&#803;arram<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4964src" href="#xd24e4964" name="xd24e4964src">1</a> (21st March,
1611). The feast of the New Year having been prepared, I seated myself
on the throne of good fortune. The Amirs and all the servants of the
Court enjoyed the good fortune of waiting on me and gave their
congratulations. The offerings of the servants of the Court
M&#299;r&#257;n &#7778;adr Jah&#257;n, &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
F&#299;r&#363;z-jang, and Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n,
were laid before me. On Wednesday, the 8th Muh&#803;arram, the offering
of R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n, who had sent it from Bengal, was laid before
me. On Thursday, the 9th of the same month, S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n and some of the mansabdars, who had come on summons
from the Deccan, waited on me. I gave a jewelled waist-dagger to
Razz&#257;q-wird&#299; &#362;zbeg. On the same day the New Year&rsquo;s
offering of Murtaz&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n was laid before me. He had
prepared all kinds of things. Having inspected all these, I took what I
approved in the shape of valuable jewels, fine cloths, elephants, and
horses and gave back the rest. I presented a jewelled dagger to
Ab&#363;-l-fath&#803; Dakhan&#299;, 3,000 rupees to M&#299;r
&#703;Abdu-llah, and an Iraq horse to Muq&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n. I
increased the rank of S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n, which
was 1,500 personal and 100 horse, by 500 personal and horse. I had
summoned him from the Deccan for the purpose of sending him to Bengal
to Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n, in reality to take his place
permanently, and I entrusted him with the charge of that Subah.
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan laid before me (as offerings)
two rubies, one royal pearl, and ten rings. I gave &#298;raj, the son
of K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, a jewelled dagger. The rank
of K&#863;hurram was 8,000 personal and 5,000 horse; I increased his
personal allowance by 2,000, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193"
href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>increased that of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, which was 1,500 personal, 1,000 horse by
500 personal, 200 horse. On 24th Muh&#803;arram, 18th Farward&#299;n,
the day of the ascendant, Y&#257;dg&#257;r &#703;Al&#299;
Sult&#804;&#257;n, ambassador of S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s,
ruler of Persia, who had come on a visit of condolence on the death of
the late king and with congratulations on my accession, had the honour
of waiting on me, and laid before me the gifts S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;Abb&#257;s, my brother, had sent. He had brought good horses,
cloth stuffs, and every kind of fitting present. After he had presented
the gifts, on the same day I gave him a superb robe of honour and
30,000 rupees, which were equivalent to 1,000 Persian tumans. He handed
me a letter in which were mingled congratulations and condolences for
the death of my revered father. As in the letter of congratulation he
expressed the greatest friendship, and omitted no point of regard and
concord, it has pleased me to enter here an exact copy of it.</p>

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;&lsquo;The pen has not the tongue to express the
secret of love.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Although outwardly the distance (between us)
prevents my attaining to the <i>ka&#703;bah</i> of desire, yet he is
the <i>qiblah</i> of my keen longing for spiritual intercourse. Thank
God that by virtue of essential oneness this humble supplicant and that
pure nursling of glory have in reality been united to one another. The
distance of space and outward separation of the body not having
prevented nearness of soul and spiritual union, my face is still
towards friendship, and accordingly the dust of sorrow has not settled
on the sun-like mirror of my mind, but it has received the reflection
of the beauty of that exhibitor of perfection, and the olfactory of my
soul has been ever scented with the sweet savour of friendship and love
and the ambergris-perfumed breezes of affection and concord, and
spiritual fellowship and perpetual union have rubbed off the rust from
friendship.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;&lsquo;I sit beside thee in thought, and my
heart is at ease,</p>
<p class="line">For this is an union not followed by separation&rsquo;s

</div>
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Praise be given to the most mighty and pure
God that the plant of the desire of true friends hath borne the fruit
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>of fruition. Success (<i>maq&#7779;&#363;d</i>),
that beauty who for years was hidden behind the veil, has by dint of
humility and supplication at the throne of the Almighty, come forth and
manifested herself from the hidden bridal chamber, and a ray of
perfection has been thrown on the plain of the hopes of the expectants;
she has ascended the auspicious throne and seated herself beside the
king who adorns the assembly and enhances the glory of the tribune of
the king of kings. The world-opening standard of the Caliphate and
rule, and the sky-scraping umbrella of justice and world-sway of that
creator of the diadem and throne, and that opener of the knots of
knowledge and wisdom have cast the shade of equity and sovereignty and
mercy over the heads of the inhabitants of the world. My hope is that
the chief of desire-granters may make the auspicious ascension of that
blessed rising of fortune brighten the crown and illuminate the throne,
making it of good omen and prosperous to all, and may the things that
appertain to kingship and rule of the world and the causes of dignity
and prosperity be ever on the increase! For long past the customs of
amity and the ways of intimacy, which have been in existence between
our ancestors, and now freshly have been re-established between this
one who is bent on friendship and him who is intent on equity, demanded
that when the good news of the accession of him who sits on the
G&#363;rg&#257;n&#299; throne and is the heir of the crown of
T&#299;m&#363;r reached this country, one of the confidants of the
royal palace should be quickly nominated to convey congratulations, but
inasmuch as the business of &#256;z&#817;arb&#299;j&#257;n and the
conquest of the province of S&#863;hirw&#257;n just then occurred, and
until my loving mind was satisfied as to the affairs of that province,
I could not return to my capital, some delay took place in the
accomplishment of this important duty. Although outward ceremonial
observances and politenesses have not much weight with people of
knowledge and discernment, yet the observance of them is the observance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>of the dues of friendship. Of necessity,
therefore, at this auspicious time when the attention of the servants
of holy angels (?) has been withdrawn from the affairs of that
province, which have been arranged in accordance with the desires of my
well-wishers, and I am at ease in that quarter, I have returned and
settled down in my capital of Isfahan, which is the permanent seat of
rule. Therefore I have despatched Kam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n Yadg&#257;r
&#703;Al&#299;, who possesses the attributes of nobility, is perfect in
sincerity and fully reliable, who is moreover of the number of devoted
servants and S&#363;f&#299;s of pure design of our family, to the most
exalted Court, that after he has obtained the good fortune to salute
you, to condole with you, and kissed the carpet of honour, and
performed the dues of inquiry (after health, etc.) and congratulations,
he may obtain leave to return, and may convey to the sincere mind of
your well-wisher the good tidings of the safety of your angelic person
and the health of your temperament that is of the brightness of the sun
and increases joy. It is hoped that the tree of hereditary friendship
and assiduousness, and the garden of intimacy and regard, both apparent
and spiritual, which by the irrigation of the rivers of affection and
the brooks of sincere regard acquire great splendour and greenness, not
casting their leaves, may set in motion the cord of intimacy and drive
away the misfortune of estrangement by the arrival of correspondence,
which is the communication of the soul, and may connect by spiritual
chains our visible friendship, and may favour the course and
accomplishment of business.</p>

<p class="par">Up to this is the copy of the letter of my brother
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s.</p>
<p class="par">My brothers Sult&#804;&#257;n Mur&#257;d and
D&#257;niy&#257;l, who had died in the lifetime of my revered father,
people had called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197"
name="pb197">197</a>]</span>by several names. I ordered that one of
them should be called S&#863;h&#257;hz&#257;da mag&#863;hf&#363;r (the
pardoned prince), and the other S&#863;h&#257;hz&#257;da
marh&#803;&#363;m (the prince admitted to mercy). I promoted
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah and &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q
Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299;, who each held the rank of 1,500, to that of
1,800, and increased the horse-rank of Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n,
brother of Isl&#257;m <span class="corr" id="xd24e5014" title=
"Source: Kkankhanan">Khankhanan</span>, by 250. I dignified &#298;raj,
eldest son of the Khankhanan, with the title of
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n, and Sa&#703;du-llah, son of
Sa&#703;&#299;d K&#863;h&#257;n, with the appellation of
Naw&#257;zis&#863;h K&#863;h&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">At the time of my accession I had increased weights and
measures (lit. <i>gaz</i>), viz. to the extent of three ratis (small
weight equal to eight barleycorns), in the weight of muhrs and rupees.
At this time it was represented to me that in mercantile transactions
it would be for the convenience of the people that muhrs and rupees
should be of the same weight as previously. As in all affairs the
contentment and ease of the people are to be looked to, I gave an order
that from the present day, that is, the 11th Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht in
the 6th year of my reign, they should strike muhrs and rupees of the
former weight in all the mints of my dominions. As before this, on
Saturday, the 2nd of the month of &#7778;afar, in the year 1020, the
evil-dispositioned Ah&#803;d&#257;d had heard that Kabul was deprived
of an eminent leader, that K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5022src" href="#xd24e5022" name="xd24e5022src">2</a>
was in the interior, and only Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk with a few servants
of the aforesaid was in Kabul, thinking it a good opportunity he
(Ah&#803;d&#257;d) betook himself unexpectedly to Kabul with a large
number of horsemen and foot-soldiers. Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk, according to
the measure of his ability, displayed activity, and the Kabulis and
other inhabitants, especially the Farmul&#299;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5025src" href="#xd24e5025" name="xd24e5025src">3</a> tribe,
barricaded up the streets and fortified their houses. The Afghans with
some guns came in to the streets and bazars <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>from
different directions. The people from the shelter of their terraces and
houses killed many of these wretches with arrows and guns, and
Barg&#299;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5030src" href="#xd24e5030" name=
"xd24e5030src">4</a> one of the confidential leaders of
Ah&#803;d&#257;d, was killed. From the occurrence of this affair, for
fear that the people from all sides and quarters should assemble and
block the road for them to get out, giving up their hearts and feet (in
a state of distraction), in fear and confusion they turned back. About
800 of those dogs went to jahannam (hell), and 200, having caught
horses, hastily escaped with their lives from that deadly place.
N&#257;d &#703;Al&#299; Maid&#257;n&#299;, who was in Lah&#363;gar, at
last on the same day arrived there, and pursued them for a short
distance. As the distance (between them) was too great and his band
small, he turned back. For the energy he had shown in coming quickly,
and for the activity displayed by Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk, they were both
promoted in rank; N&#257;d &#703;Al&#299;, who held that of 1,000
personal to that of 1,500, and Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk, who held the rank
of 1,500, to 1,800. As it transpired that K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n
and the Kabulis were in the habit of passing their days in
carelessness, and the repelling of the evil disposition of
Ah&#803;d&#257;d had taken a long time it occurred to me that as the
Khankhanan was without employment I might appoint him and his sons to
this duty. Soon after this idea occurred, Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n,
to summon whom a firman had already been issued, came from the Panjab
and obtained the honour of an audience. It became evident from the
forehead of his circumstances (his manner) that he was annoyed at the
duty of driving back the ill-dispositioned Ah&#803;d&#257;d being
assigned to K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n. As he faithfully
promised to take up this duty, it was settled that the governorship of
the Subah of the Panjab should belong to Murtaz&#803;&#257;
K&#863;h&#257;n, and that the Khankhanan should remain at home, and
that Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n should be promoted to the rank of 6,000
personal and 5,000 horse, and be appointed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>to
Kabul to drive back Ah&#803;d&#257;d and the up-country robbers. I
ordered the Khankhanan to have a jagir in the Subah of Agra in the
Sarkars of Qanauj and Kalpi, that he might inflict condign punishment
on the rebels of that region and exterminate them (pull them out by the
roots). When I dismissed them I gave each of them special robes of
honour and horses and elephants, and having received the robes of
exaltation they started <span class="corr" id="xd24e5036" title=
"Source: of">off</span>. At the same time, on account of the sincerity
of his friendship and his old services, I bestowed on
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah the rank of 2,000 personal and 500 horse,
and presented him with a sum of 5,000 rupees by way of gift.
Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n, whom I had sent to make the necessary
preparations for war for the victorious army of the Deccan and point
out to the Amirs the desirability of concord and unanimity, paid his
respects to me at the capital of Agra on the 12th of the month of
T&#299;r, the 21st of Rab&#299;&#703;u-s&#804;-s&#804;&#257;n&#299;. It
was brought to notice in a letter from Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n that
&#703;In&#257;yat K&#863;h&#257;n had performed approved service in the
Subah of Bengal; on this account I increased by 500 personal the rank
he already held of 2,000. I also increased by 500 personal and 300
horse, so as to make it up altogether to 1,500 personal and 800 horse,
the rank of R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n, who was one of the officials of that
Subah. I appointed H&#257;s&#863;him K&#863;h&#257;n,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e5039src" href="#xd24e5039" name="xd24e5039src">5</a> who was
in Orissa, to the government of Kashmir, and sent his uncle,
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain, there to look after the
affairs of that country until his arrival. In the time of my revered
father his father, Muh&#803;ammad Q&#257;sim, had conquered Kashmir.
Ch&#299;n Qil&#299;j, who was the eldest son of Qil&#299;j
K&#863;h&#257;n, came from the Subah of Kabul and waited on me. As in
addition to his natural excellence he was a
<i>k&#863;h&#257;naz&#257;d</i> (houseborn one), he was honoured with
the title of K&#863;h&#257;n, and according <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>to
the prayer of his father, and on condition of his undertaking service
in T&#299;rah, I increased his rank by 500 personal and 300 horse. On
the 14th Amard&#257;d on account of the previous service and great
sincerity and ability of I&#703;tim&#257;du-daulah, I bestowed on him
the high rank of the viziership of the kingdom, and on the same day
presented a belt with a jewelled dagger to Y&#257;dg&#257;r
&#703;Al&#299;, ambassador of the ruler of Iran. As &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been appointed to command the army against the
rebel R&#257;n&#257;, promised to enter the province of the Deccan from
the direction of Gujarat, I promoted him to be Subahdar of that
province, and at his request appointed R&#257;ja B&#257;so to the
command of the army against the R&#257;n&#257;, increasing his rank by
500 horse. In place of Gujarat I conferred the Subah of Malwa on
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am and sent 400,000 rupees to provide for
the army and warlike materials for the force that had been appointed to
accompany &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n by way of N&#257;sik, which
is near the province of the Deccan. &#7778;afdar K&#863;h&#257;n, with
his brothers, came from the Subah of Behar, and had the honour of
kissing the threshold.</p>
<p class="par">One of the royal slaves who was serving in the
seal-cutting departments prepared and laid before me a design such as I
had never seen or heard of before. As it is exceedingly strange, a
detailed<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5055src" href="#xd24e5055" name=
"xd24e5055src">6</a> description of it is given. In the shell of a
filbert four compartments had been carved out of ivory. The first
compartment was one of wrestlers, in which two men were engaged in
wrestling, a third was standing with a spear in his hand, a fourth with
a hard stone.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5058src" href="#xd24e5058"
name="xd24e5058src">7</a> Another was sitting with his hands placed on
the ground, while in front of him were laid a piece of wood, a bow and
a pot. In the second a throne had been made <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>above which a <i>s&#863;hamiy&#257;na</i> (a
tent-fly or canopy) was depicted, and a man of wealth (a prince) was
seated on the throne with one leg placed over the other and a pillow at
his back. Five servants were standing around and before him, and
tree-boughs threw a shade over the throne. In the third compartment is
a company of rope-dancers, who have raised upright a pole with three
ropes fastened to it. A rope-dancer upon it (qu. on the ropes?<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5071src" href="#xd24e5071" name=
"xd24e5071src">8</a>) has taken hold of his own right foot with his
left hand behind his head, and standing on one foot has placed a goat
on the top of the pole. Another person has thrown a drum on his neck
and is beating it, whilst another man is standing with his hands lifted
up and looking at the rope-dancer. Five other men are also standing, of
whom one has a stick in his hand. In the fourth compartment there is a
tree, below which the figure of the revered (<i>h&#803;az&#803;rat</i>)
Jesus is shown. One person has placed his head at Jesus&rsquo; feet,
and an old man is conversing with Jesus and four others are standing
by.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5084src" href="#xd24e5084" name=
"xd24e5084src">9</a> As he had made such a masterpiece, I honoured him
with a present and with increased salary.</p>
<p class="par">On the 30th S&#863;hahr&#299;war, M&#299;rz&#257;
Sult&#804;&#257;n, who had been sent for from the Deccan, came and
waited on me. &#7778;afdar K&#863;h&#257;n had an increase of rank
conferred on him, and was appointed to go to the assistance of the army
against the rebel R&#257;n&#257;. As &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
Bah&#257;dur F&#299;r&#363;z-jang had proposed to enter the
neighbouring province of the Deccan by way of N&#257;sik, it occurred
to me to appoint R&#257;m D&#257;s Kachhw&#257;ha, who was one of the
sincere servants of my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href=
"#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>revered father, to accompany him
in order that he might in every place look after him, and not allow him
to be too rash and hasty. For this purpose I bestowed on him great
favours, as well as the title of Raja, which he had not thought of for
himself. I also gave him drums and the fort of Ranthanb&#363;r, which
is one of the noted castles in Hindustan, and honouring him with a
superb robe of honour and an elephant and horse I dismissed him. I
appointed K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan, who had been
transferred from the chief Diwanship, to the duty of the Subahdarship
of the Deccan, as he had been for a long time in those regions in the
service of my deceased brother (D&#257;niy&#257;l). I honoured
Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan, son of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, with the
title of I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n, and having promoted the
sons of Mu&#703;az&#804;z&#804;am K&#863;h&#257;n to fitting ranks sent
them to Bengal to Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n. At the request of
Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n, R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n was appointed to the
government of the Sarkar of Orissa and had an increase in rank of 200
personal and horse. I presented S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n Dakhan&#299; with 4,000 rupees. On the 7th
&#256;b&#257;n Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, son of M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, came from the Deccan and waited on me.</p>
<p class="par">About this time, in consequence of the disturbances that
had occurred in the country of M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr, many of
the Amirs and &#362;zbeg soldiers, such as H&#803;usain B&#299;,
Pahluw&#257;n B&#257;b&#257;, and Nauras B&#299; Darman, and Baram
B&#299; and others came to Court and waited on me. They were all
honoured with robes of honour, horses, cash, mansabs, and jagirs. On
the 2nd &#256;z&#817;ar H&#257;s&#863;him K&#863;h&#257;n came from
Bengal and had the honour of kissing my threshold. I sent 500,000
rupees for the expenses of the victorious army of the Deccan, of which
the leader was &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, to Ahmadabad in Gujarat
by the hands of R&#363;p K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; and
S&#863;haik&#863;h Anbiy&#257;. On the 1st day I went to the village of
Samonagar, which is one of my fixed hunting-places, to hunt. Twenty-two
antelope were killed, of which I myself killed sixteen and
K&#863;hurram the other six. Remaining <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>there two days and
two nights, on the night of Sunday I returned to the city in health and
safety, and one night this couplet threw its brilliance on my
mind:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;As long as there&rsquo;s in heaven light for the
sun,</p>
<p class="line">Be not the reflection far from the Shah&rsquo;s
umbrella.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">I ordered the lamplighters and the relators of
stories that at the time of their salutations and telling stories they
should commence with this couplet, and it is still in use. On Saturday,
the 3rd day, a letter came from K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am that
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n B&#299;j&#257;p&#363;r&#299; had given
up his evil ways and become penitent, and in the rank of servants was
now more loyal than ever. On the 14th day, corresponding with the last
day of S&#863;haww&#257;l, leave was given to H&#257;s&#863;him
K&#863;h&#257;n to go to Kashmir. I gave a special wrapper<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5102src" href="#xd24e5102" name=
"xd24e5102src">10</a> (<i>fargal</i>) to Y&#257;dg&#257;r
&#703;Al&#299;, ambassador of Persia. I presented I&#703;tiq&#257;d
K&#863;h&#257;n with one of my special swords called Sar-and&#257;z
(thrower of heads). Having honoured S&#863;h&#257;dm&#257;n, son of
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, with the title of
S&#863;h&#257;dm&#257;n K&#863;h&#257;n, I increased his rank to 1,700
personal and 500 horse. He was also honoured with a standard.
Sard&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, brother of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
F&#299;r&#363;z-jang, and Arsl&#257;n B&#299; &#362;zbeg, who had been
appointed to the charge of S&#299;vist&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5108src" href="#xd24e5108" name="xd24e5108src">11</a> were also
presented with standards. I ordered that
<i>j&#257;&#702;i-nam&#257;z</i> (prayer carpets) should be made of the
skins of the antelopes I had myself killed, and be kept in the public
audience hall for people to use in saying their prayers. By way of
special respect to the Law I ordered that the M&#299;r-i-&#703;Adl and
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299;, who are the pivot of affairs of the divine law,
should not kiss the ground (before me), which is a kind of
<i>sijda</i>. On Thursday, the 22nd day, I went again to Samonagar to
hunt. As many antelope had collected together in that neighbourhood I
had this time sent off K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n to prepare a
qamargah and drive in the antelope into a broad place from all sides,
to place canvas-walls <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href=
"#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>(<i>sar&#257;-parda</i>) and a
<i>gul&#257;l-b&#257;&#7771;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e5125src"
href="#xd24e5125" name="xd24e5125src">12</a> round it. They enclosed a
kos and half of ground with sarapardas. When news came that the
hunting-place had been prepared and a great deal of game had been
confined, I went there and began to hunt on the Friday. Until the next
Thursday I went every day to the qamargah with the ladies and hunted as
much as I liked. Some of the deer were taken alive and some killed with
arrows and guns. On the Sunday and Thursday, on which I do not fire
guns at animals, they took them alive in nets. In these seven days 917
head, male and female, were caught, and of these 641 deer were caught
alive. Four hundred and four head were sent to Fath&#803;p&#363;r to be
let loose on the plain there, and with regard to 84 I ordered them to
put silver rings in their noses and set them free in the same place.
The 276 other antelope that had been killed with guns and arrows and by
cheetahs were divided from day to day among the Begams and the slaves
of the palace, and Amirs and servants of the palace. As I became very
tired (<i>dilg&#299;r</i>) of hunting, I gave orders to the Amirs to go
to the <i>s&#863;hik&#257;rg&#257;h</i> (hunting-place) and hunt all
that were left over, and myself returned in safety to the city. On the
1st Bahman, corresponding with the 17th Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da, I
ordered that in the large cities of my dominions, like Ahmadabad,
Allahabad, Lahore, Delhi, Agra, etc., they should arrange
bulg&#863;hur-k&#863;h&#257;nas (places for the distribution of cooked
food) for the poor; thirty mahalls (districts) had been ordered. Six
had already been established, and twenty-four other districts were now
ordered. On the 4th Bahman I increased the rank of R&#257;ja B&#299;r
Singh Deo by 1,000 personal; it was previously 4,000 personal and 2,000
horse: I gave him a jewelled sword. Another sword out of my special
ones, that was called S&#863;h&#257;h-bacha, (king&rsquo;s child), was
presented to S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 16th
Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;, Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, son of
M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>was
appointed to the army against the rebel R&#257;n&#257; and a sword sent
by his hand for R&#257;ja B&#257;so. Having again heard that the Amirs
on the borders interfere with authority in matters that do not concern
them, and do not observe laws and regulations, I ordered<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5137src" href="#xd24e5137" name=
"xd24e5137src">13</a> that the Bakhshis should circulate orders, to be
obeyed amongst the Amirs of the borders, that hereafter they should not
interfere in such things, which are the private affair of kings. The
first thing is this, that they should not sit in the <i>jharokha</i>
(private window), and should not trouble their officers and captains of
the auxiliaries with keeping guard or saluting them, and should not
have elephant fights, and should not inflict the punishment of
blinding, and should not cut off ears and noses, and should not force
Islam on anyone, and should not confer titles on their servants, and
should not order the royal servants to do <i>k&#363;rnis&#863;h</i> or
prostration, and should not force singers to remain on duty in the
manner customary in (royal) darbars, and should not beat drums when
they go out, and when they give a horse or elephant to anyone, whether
to the king&rsquo;s attendants or to their own servants, they should
not place reins or elephant&rsquo;s goads on their backs and make them
perform obeisance. In going in procession they should not take with
them on foot in their retinue the royal attendants. If they write
anything to them they should not put a seal on it.<a class="noteref"

Jah&#257;ng&#299;r does not mention that it was in this year that he

on 14th K&#863;hurd&#257;d (end of May, 1611). It was in the 11th year
that she got the title of N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n. Before that she was

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On Tuesday, the 1st Farward&#299;n of the seventh
year from my accession on the 16th Muh&#803;arram u-l-h&#803;ar&#257;m
(19th March, 1612) in the year 1021, the New Year&rsquo;s assembly that
illuminates the world, and the festival that brings joy, were held in
the capital of Agra. After four gharis of the night had passed on
Thursday, the 3rd of the aforesaid month, the hour that the astrologers
had chosen, I sat on the throne. I had ordered that, according to
annual custom, the bazars should be decorated and the assembly should
be kept up until the day of culmination
(<i>r&#363;z-i-s&#863;haraf</i>). K&#863;husrau B&#299; &#362;zbeg, who
was known among the Uzbegs as K&#863;husrau
<i>Qimch&#299;</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5172src" href=
"#xd24e5172" name="xd24e5172src">1</a> came on these days and had the
honour of waiting on me. As he was one of the influential men of
M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr, I bestowed many favours on him, and
gave him a fine robe of honour. I gave 15,000 rupees to
Y&#257;dg&#257;r &#703;Al&#299;, ambassador of the ruler of Iran, for
his expenses. On the same day the offering of Afz&#803;al
K&#863;h&#257;n, which he had sent from the Subah of Behar, was laid
before me. There were 30 elephants and 18 ponies
(<i>g&#363;n&#7789;h</i>), and pieces of Bengal cloth, sandalwood, some
pods of musk, aloes-wood (<i>Agallochum</i>), and all kinds of things.
The offering of K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n was also produced before
me. He had sent 45 head of horse and two strings of camels, porcelain
from China, dressing-gowns (<i>p&#363;st&#299;nh&#257;</i><a class=

presents procurable in Kabul and its neighbourhood. The officers of the
palace had taken trouble about their offerings, and according to the
yearly custom from day to day of the festival the offerings of the
servants were laid before me. Having looked at them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>in
detail, I took what I approved and gave them the remainder. On the 13th
Farward&#299;n, corresponding with the 29th Muh&#803;arram, a
representation from Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n arrived to the effect
that through the blessing of Allah&rsquo;s favour and through the
benign influence of the royal grace, Bengal had been freed from the
disturbance of &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n, the Afghan. Before the
circumstances of this war are written down, some particulars with
regard to Bengal will be recorded.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5200src"

Chittagong to Gar&#299;, is 450 kos; and its breadth, from the Northern
hills to the boundary of Sarkar Mad&#257;ran, 220 kos. Its revenue is
about 60 krores of dams.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5203src" href=
"#xd24e5203" name="xd24e5203src">4</a> The former rulers of this place
always had 20,000 horse, a lakh of foot-soldiers, 1,000 elephants, and
4,000 or 5,000 war-boats. From the time of S&#863;h&#299;r
K&#863;h&#257;n and his son Sal&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n, this country
was in the possession of the Afghans. When the throne of sovereignty of
Hindustan in the hands of my revered father acquired beauty and
splendour, he ordered the victorious forces (of the empire) into it,
and for a long time made the conquest of it his object, until the
aforesaid province, through the great efforts of the chiefs of the
victorious State, passed from the possession of D&#257;&#702;&#363;d
Kar&#257;n&#299;, who was the last of its rulers. That wretch was
killed in the fight with K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, and his army
became scattered and in desperate condition. From that date until now
the province is in the possession of the servants of the State. In the
end a few of the remaining Afghans had remained in the corners and
sides of the country, and kept a few distant places in their
possession, until, by degrees, most of that body became despised and
helpless, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>and were captured by the chiefs of the State in
the places of which they had still possession. When the arrangement of
the affairs of rule and empire, simply through the grace of God, became
entrusted to this humble servant of the throne of Allah, in the first
year after my accession I sent for R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh, who had
been appointed to the rule and government of that place, to Court, and
sent Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n, who, out of all the
officials, was distinguished as my foster-brother, in his place. As he
entered the province he attained to martyrdom at the hand of one of
those mischievous ones who had been appointed to that country, and that
man, who had not thought of the consequences, also obtained the reward
of his deeds, and was slain. I promoted Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was governor and a Jagirdar in the province of
Behar, on account of his nearness to that neighbourhood, to the rank of
5,000 personal and horse, and ordered him to go to Bengal and take
possession of the province. I sent an order to Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was at the capital of Agra, to go to Behar and
consider that province his jagir. When a short time had passed under
the rule of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, he contracted
a severe illness, in consequence of the bad water and air of that
place, and by degrees the power of the disease and his weakness became
so great as to end in his destruction. When the news of his death came
to my hearing at Lahore, an order was issued in the name of Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n to proceed as soon as possible to Bengal. When I
appointed him to this important duty, most of the servants of the State
made remarks on his youth and want of experience. As the excellence of
his disposition and his natural capacity had been noticed by my
judicious eye, I myself chose him for this duty. As it happened, the
affairs of this province were carried on by him in such a manner as
from the time when it first entered into the possession of the Chiefs
of the everlasting State until this day has never been attained to by
any of the servants of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href=
"#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>the Court. One of his noteworthy
deeds was the driving away of the rebel &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n, the
Afghan. He frequently in the time of the late king encountered the
royal forces, but his expulsion was not accomplished. When Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n made Dhaka (Dacca) his place of abode and made the
subjection of the Zamindars of that neighbourhood his chief object, it
occurred to him that he should send an army against the rebel
&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n and his province. If he agreed to serve loyally,
well and good, but if not, they should punish and annihilate him like
other seditious people. At that time S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5211src" href="#xd24e5211"
name="xd24e5211src">5</a> joined Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n, and the
lot of leading in this service<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5214src"
href="#xd24e5214" name="xd24e5214src">6</a> fell on his name. Several
others of the State servants were also appointed to go with him, such
as Kis&#863;hwar K&#863;h&#257;n, Iftik&#863;h&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n,
Sayyid &#256;dam B&#257;rha, S&#863;haik&#863;h Achhay,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5217src" href="#xd24e5217" name="xd24e5217src">7</a>
nephew of Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n, Mu&#703;tamad K&#863;h&#257;n, the
sons of Mu&#703;az&#804;z&#804;am K&#863;h&#257;n Ihtim&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, and others. He took with him also some of his own men.
At the hour when Mus&#863;htar&#299; (Jupiter) was propitious, he
started off this band, and appointed M&#299;r Q&#257;sim, son of
M&#299;rz&#257; Mur&#257;d, its chief paymaster and news-writer. He
took also some of the Zamindars with him to show the road. The
victorious armies started. When they reached the neighbourhood of
&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n&rsquo;s fort and land, they sent some eloquent
men to admonish him and point out to him the way of loyalty, and bring
him back from the road of rebellion to the right path. As much pride
had seated itself in his brain-cup, and he had in his head a desire to
seize the country, beside other fancies, he turned a deaf ear to their
words and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>prepared himself for conflict and fight. The
battlefield happened to be on the bank of a nullah in a place which was
a complete bog. On Sunday (12th March, 1612), the 9th Muh&#803;arram,
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n, choosing the hour for the
fight, arrayed the victorious forces, so that everyone should go to his
place and be prepared for the battle. &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n had not
settled the battle for that day with himself. When he heard that the
royal army had come prepared for battle, having no remedy he himself
mounted and came to the bank of the nullah, and arrayed his own horse
and foot opposite the victorious army. When the affair grew hot, and
the two forces opposed each other, that foolish, obstinate man at the
first onset threw his own fighting raging elephant against the advanced
guard. After much fighting many of the leaders of the advanced guard,
as Sayyid &#256;dam<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5228src" href=
"#xd24e5228" name="xd24e5228src">8</a> B&#257;rha and
S&#863;haik&#863;h Achhay, attained the dignity of martyrdom.
Iftik&#863;h&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, the leader of the right wing, was
in no way remiss in attacking, and sacrificed his own life. The band
that was with him fought to such a degree that they were all cut to
pieces. In the same way Kis&#863;hwar<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5231src" href="#xd24e5231" name="xd24e5231src">9</a>
K&#863;h&#257;n and his band of the left wing bravely sacrificed
themselves in the affair of their master, but many of the enemy (lit.
those of dark fortune) were also wounded and killed. That evil one
(&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n) took account of the combatants and ascertained
that the leaders of the advanced guard and right and left wings were
killed. The centre alone remained. He took no account of the killed and
wounded on his own side, but attacked the centre (of the royal army)
with the same energy. On this side the son and brothers and sons-in-law
of S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n, as well as other officers,
stopped the advance of those lost ones, and attacked them like tigers
and leopards armed with claws and teeth. Some of them attained the
dignity of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>martyrdom, and those that remained alive bore
away fatal wounds. At this time (&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n) drove a raging
elephant of the name of Gajpat,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5236src"
href="#xd24e5236" name="xd24e5236src">10</a> which was his premier
elephant, at S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n, who laid hold of
his spear and struck the elephant. What does a raging elephant care for
a javelin. He then seized his sword and struck him two blows one after
another. How did he regard these either! He then drew his dagger and
struck him twice with it, but for this, too, he did not turn back, but
overthrew S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n with his horse.
Immediately he was separated from his horse; calling out
&ldquo;Jah&#257;ng&#299;r S&#863;h&#257;h,&rdquo; he leapt up, and his
equerry struck the elephant on both front legs a blow with a two-handed
sword. As the elephant fell on his knees, the equerry pulled the
elephant driver down off the elephant, and S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
with the dagger he had in his hand, and while on foot, struck such
blows on the trunk and forehead of the elephant that the elephant
roared out at the pain and turned round. As he was severely wounded, he
went to his own army and fell down. S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s horse got up safely. As he was mounting his
horse those vile ones drove another elephant at his standard-bearer,
and overthrew his horse and standard. S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n gave a manly shout and roused the standard-bearer,
saying: &ldquo;Be bold: I&rsquo;m alive and the standard is at my feet
(?).&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5239src" href="#xd24e5239" name=
"xd24e5239src">11</a> At this critical moment all the servants of the
State who were present seized their arrows and daggers and swords, and
smote the elephant. S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at himself came up and
shouted to the standard-bearer to rise, and got another horse for the
standard-bearer and mounted him on it. The standard-bearer unfurled the
standard and maintained his ground. At the time of this struggle
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>a (ball from a) gun struck that rebel on his
forehead. However much they enquired for the man who fired it he could
not be found. When this struck him, he recognized that he was a dead
man. Yet for two watches, notwithstanding this fatal wound, he urged on
his men to the fight, and the battlefield was still deadly and the
struggle warm. Afterwards the enemy turned their faces, and the
victorious army pursued them, and continually striking them drove back
those vile ones into the place where they had encamped. With arrows and
guns those wretches would not allow the royal troops to enter the place
where they were. When Wal&#299;, the brother of &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n,
and Mamrez, his (&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n&rsquo;s) son and other
relations and followers became aware of &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n&rsquo;s
wound, they made up their minds that he would not recover from it, and
that if they, defeated and put to flight, should go towards their fort
none would reach it alive. They thought it best to remain for the night
in the place where they had encamped, and towards the end of the night
seek an opportunity and get to their fort. Two watches of night had
passed when &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n went to hell. In the third watch
they raised his lifeless body, and leaving his tent and the things they
had with them in the camp, proceeded to their fortress. The scouts of
the victorious army, having obtained news of this, informed
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n. On the morning of Monday the
loyalists assembled and decided to follow them, and not allow
breathing-time to those of dark fortune. In the end, in consequence of
the tired state of the soldiers, and in order to bury the martyrs and
out of sympathy for the wounded, they were perplexed in their minds as
to going or settling down (where they were). Just at this time
&#703;Abdu-s-Sal&#257;m, son of Mu&#703;az&#804;z&#804;am
K&#863;h&#257;n, arrived with a body of servants of the State,
altogether 300 horse and 400 musketeers (<i>t&#363;pch&#299;</i>). When
this fresh body of men arrived it was determined to pursue, and they
accordingly went on. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213"
name="pb213">213</a>]</span>When Wal&#299;, who after
&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n was the stock of the disturbance, learned that
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n with the victorious army had
come together with another fresh force, he saw no resource for himself
but to go to S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n on the straight
line of faith and loyalty. In the end he sent a message that he who had
been the cause of the disturbance had gone, and that the body of those
who were left were servants and Musulmans. If he would give his word
they would wait upon him and would agree to serve the State, giving
their elephants as an offering. S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n and Mu&#703;taqid K&#863;h&#257;n, who had arrived on
the day of the battle and had done approved service, and all those who
were loyal, in accordance with the necessity of the time and with what
was best for the State, gave their word and encouraged them. On the
next day, Wal&#299; and the sons, brothers, and sons-in-law of
&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n all came and waited upon
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n and the other servants of the
State. They brought forty-nine elephants as an offering. After the
completion of this work S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n,
leaving some of the royal servants in Adh&#257;r<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5250src" href="#xd24e5250" name="xd24e5250src">12</a> and the
neighbourhood which was in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214"
href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>possession of that one of
evil fortune, took with him Wal&#299; and the other Afghans, and on
Monday, the 6th of the month of &#7778;afar, came to
Jah&#257;ng&#299;rnagar (Dacca) and joined Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n.
When the joyful news reached in Agra this supplicant at the throne of
Allah, he performed the prostrations of gratitude, and recognized that
the driving away of this description of enemy was brought about simply
through the unstinted mercy of the Almighty Giver. As a reward for this
good service I promoted Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n to the rank of 6,000
personal, and honoured S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n with
the title of &ldquo;Rustam of the age&rdquo; (Rustam-zam&#257;n), as
well as increased his rank by 1,000 personal and horse. I also
increased the rank of other servants according to the measure of their
services, and they were selected for other honours.</p>
<p class="par">When this news first came of the killing of
&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n it appeared to be a joke, but by way of
ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the words I took an omen from
the div&#257;n of the tongue of the unseen world, K&#863;hw&#257;ja
H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804; of Shiraz, and this g&#863;hazal<a class=

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=

<p class="par">As this couplet was very appropriate to the occasion, I
drew an omen from it. After some days news came again that the arrow of
Fate, or rather of God, had struck &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n, for however
much they enquired for him, he who fired the shot was not made
manifest. This has been recorded on account of its strange nature.</p>
<p class="par">On the 16th Farward&#299;n, Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n,
who is one of my chief retainers and the old confidants of the
Jahangiri service, who had attained the rank of 3,000 personal and
2,000 horse, came from the fort of Cambay and had the honour of waiting
on me. I had ordered him, on account of certain business, to go to the
port of Goa<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5307src" href="#xd24e5307" name=
"xd24e5307src">14</a> and buy for the private use of the government
certain rareties procurable there. According to orders he went with
diligence to Goa, and remaining there for some time, took at the price
the Franks asked for them the rareties he met with at that port,
without looking at the face of the money at all (i.e. regardless of
cost). When he returned from the aforesaid port to the Court, he
produced before me one by one the things and rareties he had brought.
Among these were some animals that were very strange and wonderful,
such as I had never seen, and up to this time no one had known their
names. Although King B&#257;bar has described in his Memoirs the
appearance and shapes of several animals, he had never ordered the
painters to make pictures of them. As these animals appeared to me to
be very strange, I both described them and ordered that painters should
draw them in the Jah&#257;ng&#299;r-n&#257;ma, so that the amazement
that arose from hearing of them might be increased. One of these
animals in body is larger than a peahen and smaller than a
peacock.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5310src" href="#xd24e5310" name=
"xd24e5310src">15</a> When <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href=
"#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>it is in heat and displays itself,
it spreads out its feathers like the peacock and dances about. Its beak
and legs are like those of a cock. Its head and neck and the part under
the throat are every minute of a different colour. When it is in heat
it is quite red&mdash;one might say it had adorned itself with red
coral&mdash;and after a while it becomes white in the same places, and
looks like cotton. It sometimes looks of a turquoise colour. Like a
chameleon it constantly changes colour. Two pieces of flesh it has on
its head look like the comb of a cock. A strange thing is this, that
when it is in heat the aforesaid piece of flesh hangs down to the
length of a span from the top of its head like an elephant&rsquo;s
trunk, and again when he raises it up it appears on its head like the
horn of a rhinoceros, to the extent of two finger-breadths. Round its
eyes it is always of a turquoise colour, and does not change. Its
feathers appear to be of various colours, differing from the colours of
the peacock&rsquo;s feathers. He also brought a monkey of a strange and
wonderful form. Its hands, feet, ears, and head are like those of a
monkey, and its face like that of a fox. The colour of its eyes is like
that of a hawk&rsquo;s eye, but the eyes are larger than those of a
hawk. From its head to the end of its tail it is an ordinary cubit in
length. It is lower than a monkey and taller than a fox. Its hair is
like the wool of a sheep and its colour like that of ashes. From the
lobe of its ear to its chin it is red and of the colour of wine. Its
tail is two or three finger-breadths longer than half a cubit, quite
different from that of other monkeys. The tail of this animal hangs
down like the tail of a cat. Sometimes it makes a sound like a young
antelope. On the whole it is a very strange beast. Of the wild birds
which they call <i>tadr&#363;</i> (pheasant) till now it has never been
heard that they breed in captivity. In the time of my revered father
they made great efforts to obtain eggs and young ones but it was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>not managed. I ordered them to keep some of
them, male and female, in one place, and by degrees they bred. I
ordered them to place the eggs under hens, and in a space of two years
sixty or seventy young were produced and fifty or sixty grew up.
Whoever heard of this matter was astonished. It was said that in the
Wil&#257;yat (Persia?) the people there had made great efforts, but no
eggs were produced and no young were obtained.</p>
<p class="par">In these days I increased the mansab of Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n by 1,000 personal and 500 horse, which thus became
4,000 personal and 3,500 horse. The mansab of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, original and increased, was fixed at 4,000
personal and 1,000 horse. To the mansab of Mah&#257; Singh also an
increase of 500 personal and horse was given: it was originally and
with increase 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse. The mansab of
I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n was increased by 500 personal and 200
horse, and made up to 1,000 personal and 300 horse. K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan in these days came from the Deccan and waited on
me. Daulat K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been appointed to the
faujd&#257;rship of Allahabad and of the Sarkar of Jaunpur, came and
paid his respects: an increase of 500 was made to his mansab, which was
1,000. On the day of culmination (<i>r&#363;z-i-s&#863;haraf</i>),
which was the 19th Farward&#299;n, I raised the mansab of
Sult&#804;&#257;n K&#863;hurram, which was 10,000, to 12,000, and made
that of I&#703;tib&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, which was 3,000 personal and
1,000 horse, up to 4,000. I raised the mansab of Muqarrab
K&#863;h&#257;n from 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse by 500 personal and
horse; and increased that of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, which was
2,000 personal and 1,200 horse, by 500. As these were the days of the
New Year, many of the servants (of the State) obtained an increase of
their mansabs. On the same day Dul&#299;p came from the Deccan and
waited on me. As his father R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh had died, I
honoured him with the title of R&#257;y and clothed him in a dress of
honour. R&#257;y R&#257;y Singh had another son, by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>name
S&#363;raj Singh. Although Dul&#299;p was his
<i>&#7789;&#299;k&#257;</i> (marked with the
<i>&#7789;&#299;k&#257;</i>) son, he wished S&#363;raj Singh to succeed
him, in consequence of the love that he bore to his mother. When the
circumstances of his death were reported to me, S&#363;raj Singh, in
consequence of his want of intelligence and tender years, represented
to me: &ldquo;My father has made me his successor and given me the
<i>&#7789;&#299;k&#257;</i>.&rdquo; This remark was not to my liking,
and I said: &ldquo;If thy father has given the
<i>&#7789;&#299;k&#257;</i> to thee, we shall give it to
Dul&#299;p.&rdquo; Then marking the <i>&#7789;&#299;k&#257;</i> with my
own hand, I presented the latter with his father&rsquo;s jagir and
hereditary possessions. I bestowed on I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah an
inkstand and jewelled pen. R&#363;dar, the father of Lakhm&#299; Chand,
Raja of Kumaon, who is one of the considerable Rajas of the hill
country, had come in the time of the late King Akbar,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e5349src" href="#xd24e5349" name="xd24e5349src">16</a> and when

<p class="par">In order to lay the foundation of a palace at Lahore, I
sent there K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n K&#863;hw&#257;ja D&#363;st
Muh&#803;ammad, who is well skilled in this kind of business.</p>
<p class="par">As the affairs of the Deccan, in consequence of the
disagreements among the Sardars and the carelessness of K&#863;h&#257;n
A&#703;z&#804;am, did not look well, and the defeat of &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n had taken place, I had sent for K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan to make enquiries into the real state of these
quarrels. After much enquiry and investigation it became clear that the
defeat of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n had been caused by his pride
and his sharp temper, and not listening to words (of advice) and partly
by the quarrels and want of agreement between the Amirs. Briefly, it
had been determined that &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n should start
from the direction of N&#257;sik and Trimbak with the Gujarat army and
the Amirs who had been appointed to accompany him. This army had been
brought into proper order by trustworthy leaders and zealous Amirs,
such as R&#257;ja R&#257;m D&#257;s, K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;lam, Saif
K&#863;h&#257;n, &#703;Al&#299; Mard&#257;n Bah&#257;dur, Z&#804;afar
K&#863;h&#257;n, and other servants of the State. The number of the
army had passed 10,000 and come up to near 14,000. On the side of Berar
it was settled that R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh, K&#863;h&#257;n
Jah&#257;n, the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257;, and many other leaders should
proceed. These two armies should be aware of each other&rsquo;s marches
and halts, so that on an appointed day they might catch the enemy
between the two. If this rule had been observed and their hearts had
been in unison, and self-interest had not come between, it is most
probable that Almighty God would have given them the victory of the
day. When &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n passed the Ghats and entered
the enemy&rsquo;s country, he did not take care to send runners
(<i>q&#257;&#7779;id&#257;n</i>) to bring intelligence from the other
army, nor did he, in accordance with the arrangements, make his
movements harmonise with theirs, so that on an appointed day they might
take the enemy between two armies. Rather he relied on his own
strength, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>and considered that if he could gain the victory
alone it would be better. This idea fixed itself in his mind, and
however much R&#257;m D&#257;s desired him to promise to go forward
with due deliberation, it was of no use. The enemy, who were observing
him closely, had sent a large number of leaders and Barg&#299;s
(Mahrattas) against him, and encounters took place with them every day.
They did not fail to throw rockets and different fireworks at night. At
last the enemy drew near, and yet he obtained no intelligence about the
other army, though he had approached Daulatabad, which was the place of
assembly of the Dakhanis. &#703;Ambar, the black-faced, had raised to
sovereignty a child who, in his opinion, bore relationship to the
family of Niz&#804;&#257;mu-l-mulk. In order that men might fully
accept his (the child&rsquo;s) sovereignty, he raised him up and took
him by the hand, and made himself the Peshwa and leader. He sent men
again and again (against &#703;Abdu-llah), and the number of the enemy
was continually increasing till at last they made an attack, and by
throwing rockets and other fireworks made matters hot for him.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5387src" href="#xd24e5387" name=
"xd24e5387src">20</a> At length the loyalists thought it best, as no
assistance had come to them from the other army and all the Dakhanis
had turned against them, to retreat at once and try some other
arrangement. All agreed, and with one consent started off before dawn.
The Dakhanis followed them to the boundaries of their own country, and
the two armies, meeting every day, did not fail in fighting. In these
days several of the ambitious and zealous young men were killed.
&#703;Al&#299; Mard&#257;n K&#863;h&#257;n Bah&#257;dur, behaving like
a brave man, carried away terrible wounds and fell into the hands of
the enemy, and showed his companions an example of fidelity to his salt
and of life-sacrifice. Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r Beg also displayed
manly actions, and a rocket struck him on <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

afterwards he died. When they entered the country of R&#257;ja
Bharj&#363;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5392src" href="#xd24e5392"
name="xd24e5392src">21</a> who was one of those loyal to the throne,
that body (the enemy) turned back, and &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
proceeded towards Gujarat. The real truth is this, that if in going he
had drawn his rein (gone slowly) and allowed the other army to have
come up to him, the matter would have turned out according to the wish
of the chief men of the victorious State.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5396src" href="#xd24e5396" name="xd24e5396src">22</a> As soon as
the news of the retreat of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n reached the
leaders of the army that was advancing from Berar, not seeing any
advantage from further stay, they also retired, and joined the camp of
Parwiz at &#703;&#256;dil&#257;b&#257;d in the neighbourhood of
Burhanpur. When this intelligence reached me at Agra I was greatly
agitated, and proposed to go there myself and destroy root and branch
those servants who had become masters. The Amirs and other devoted ones
would in no way consent to this. K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan represented that as no one understood the
business of that region as the Khankhanan did I ought to send him, and
that he should again arrange matters that had fallen into disorder, and
according to the exigencies of the time should compose differences so
that affairs might return to their original condition. Other
well-wishers being consulted, all their opinions were at one in this,
that the Khankhanan must be sent and that K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan should accompany him. Agreeing with this
determination, those who had charge of the affairs of the Khankhanan
and his companions obtained leave to go on Sunday, the 17th
Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, in the 7th year. S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z
K&#863;h&#257;n, K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan,
Razz&#257;q-bird&#299; &#362;zbeg, and several others of his associates
paid their parting salutations on the same day. The Khankhanan was
promoted to the rank of 6,000 personal, S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z
K&#863;h&#257;n <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222"
name="pb222">222</a>]</span>to that of 3,000 and horse, that of
D&#257;r&#257;b K&#863;h&#257;n increased by 500 personal and 300 horse
(altogether 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse), and to
Rah&#803;man-d&#257;d, his (the Khankhanan&rsquo;s) younger son, I also
gave a fitting mansab. I presented the Khankhanan with a grand dress of
honour, a jewelled dagger, a special elephant with <i>tal&#257;yir</i>
(accoutrements), and an Iraq horse. In the same way I bestowed on his
sons and companions dresses of honour and horses. In the same month
Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk came from Kabul with his sons, and had the good
fortune to kiss the threshold. S&#863;hy&#257;m Singh and R&#257;y
Mangat Bhadauriya, who belonged to the army of Bangash, according to
the request of Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, were promoted to higher
mansabs. S&#863;hy&#257;m Singh had 1,500 personal and was increased by
500, and R&#257;y Mangat was also raised to a higher rank.</p>
<p class="par">For a long time past news had come of the illness of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n; sometimes the disease was got under
and sometimes recurred, until he died at Burhanpur in the 63rd year of
his age. His understanding and capacity were very good. He was very
quick-witted. He also wrote poetry. He composed &ldquo;K&#863;husrau
and S&#863;h&#299;r&#299;n,&rdquo; dedicating it to me, and called it
the &ldquo;N&#363;r-n&#257;ma&rdquo; (the writing of light).<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5406src" href="#xd24e5406" name=
"xd24e5406src">23</a> He had been ennobled in the time of my revered
father and made Vizier. In the days when I was a prince he had several
times done foolish things, and most men, and indeed K&#863;husrau
himself, were of opinion that after my accession I would do unpleasant
things (with regard to him). In a manner contrary to what had entered
the minds of himself and others, I favoured him and promoted him to the
rank of 5,000 personal and horse, and after he had for some time been
Vizier with full authority, neglected no point in increasing favour
towards him. After his death I gave mansabs to his sons and bestowed
kindnesses on them. At last <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href=
"#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>it was clear that his disposition
and sincerity were not as they should be, and, considering his own evil
deeds, he had always been suspicious with regard to me. They say he was
aware of the conspiracy and disturbance that took place on the Kabul
expedition, and had given support to the wretches. Indeed, I had no
confidence that notwithstanding my favour and kindness to him he was
not disloyal and of perverse fortune.</p>
<p class="par">After a short space of time, on the 25th of the same
month of Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, the news of M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;&rsquo;s death arrived. The said M&#299;rz&#257;
was of the ruling family of Thatta (Tatta), of the tribe of
Tark&#863;h&#257;n&#299;. His father, M&#299;rz&#257; J&#257;n&#299;,
in the time of my revered father became loyal, and with the Khankhanan,
who had been appointed to his province, he had the good fortune to have
the honour of waiting on Akbar near Lahore. By the royal favour he was
given his own province, and, choosing himself to serve at Court, he
sent his men to the charge and administration of Thatta, and remained
in the service while he lived. At last he died at Burhanpur.
M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, his son, who was
at Thatta, in accordance with the firman of the late king obtained the
government of that country. Sa&#703;&#299;d K&#863;h&#257;n, who was at
Bhakar (Bukkur), received an order to console him and bring him to
Court. The aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n sent men to him to recommend
loyalty to him. At last, having brought him to Agra, he procured him
the honour of kissing the feet of my revered father. He was at Agra
when my father died and I ascended the throne. After I arrived at
Lahore for the pursuit of K&#863;husrau news came that the Amirs on the
borders of Khurasan had assembled together and proceeded against
Qandahar, and that S&#863;h&#257;h Beg, the governor of that place, was
shut up in the fort and looking out for assistance. Of necessity an
army was appointed for the relief of Qandahar under the leadership of
M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; and other Amirs and generals.
When this army reached the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href=
"#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>neighbourhood of Qandahar, the
army of Khurasan, not seeing in themselves the power to await it,
returned. M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;, having entered
Qandahar, handed over the country and the fort to Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been appointed to the government of the place,
and S&#863;h&#257;h Beg went to his own jagir. M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; started for Lahore by way of Bhakar. Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n was only a short time at Qandahar before he died, and
that province was again in need of a leader and master. This time I
added Qandahar to Thatta and handed it over to M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;. From that time till his death he remained there
continuously in performance of the duties of its protection and
government. His conduct towards the disaffected was excellent. As it
was necessary to send a leader to Qandahar in the place of
M&#299;rz&#257; G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;, I appointed Ab&#363;-l-b&#299;
&#362;zbeg,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5416src" href="#xd24e5416" name=
"xd24e5416src">24</a> who was at Multan and in that neighbourhood, to
that post. I promoted him in rank from 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse
to 3,000 personal and horse, and honoured him with the title of
Bah&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n and a standard. The governorship of Delhi
and the protection and administration of that province was conferred on
Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n. I dignified R&#363;p
K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779;, who was one of the personal servants of
my revered father, with the title of K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779;
K&#863;h&#257;n, and, giving him the rank of 1,000 personal and 500
horse, bestowed on him the faujd&#257;rship of the Sarkar of Qanuj. As
I had sought the daughter<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5422src" href=

K&#863;hurram, and the marriage <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225"

for, I went on Thursday, 18th K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d, to his house,
and stayed there one day and one night. He (K&#863;hurram) presented
offerings (to me) and he gave jewels<a class="noteref" id=

Begams, and to his mothers (including stepmothers) and to the female
servants of the harem, and dresses of honour to the Amirs.</p>
<p class="par">I sent &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q, the bakhshi of the
palace (<i>dark&#863;h&#257;na</i>), to settle the country of Thatta
(Sind) until a Sardar should be appointed who could conciliate the
soldiery and the cultivators, and so bring the province into order. I
increased his rank and presented him with an elephant and a shawl
(<i>parmnarm</i>), and sent him off. I made Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk bakhshi
in his room. K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, who had been sent to inspect
the buildings in Lahore and to arrange about them, came in the end of
this month and waited on me. M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;&#298;s&#257;
Tark&#863;h&#257;n, one of the relations of M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;, had been appointed to the army of the Deccan. I
sent for him to arrange about the business of Thatta, and on the same
day he had the good fortune to pay his respects. As he was deserving of
favour, he was given the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. The
disease <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=

physicians on Wednesday, the (date not given) of the said month, I drew
about a sir (<i>&#257;s&#804;&#257;r</i>)<a class="noteref" id=

from my left arm. As great lightness resulted, it occurred to me that
if they were to call blood-letting &lsquo;lightening&rsquo; it would be
well. Nowadays this expression is made use of. To Muqarrab
K&#863;h&#257;n, who had bled me, I gave a jewelled <i>khapwa</i>
(dagger). Kis&#863;han D&#257;s, accountant of the elephant department
and stable, who from the time of the late king until now has been the
clerk in charge of two departments, and for ages had been hopeful of
the title of Raja and the rank of 1,000 personal, and before this had
been gratified with a title, now had the rank of 1,000 conferred on
him. M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam, son of Sult&#257;n H&#803;usain
M&#299;rz&#257; &#7778;afaw&#299;, who had been appointed to the army
of the Deccan, I sent for at his request. On Saturday, the 9th of the
month of T&#299;r, he came with his sons and waited on me. He made an
offering of a ruby and forty-six royal pearls. I increased the rank of
T&#257;j K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of Bhakar, who was one of the
old Amirs of this State, by 500 personal and horse.</p>
<p class="par">The tale of the death of S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n is a very strange affair. After he had performed such
services and Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n had given him leave to go to
the Sarkar of Orissa, one night on the road he was riding on a female
elephant <i>chaukand&#299;-d&#257;r</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5488src" href="#xd24e5488" name="xd24e5488src">29</a> (? in a

place behind him<span class="corr" id="xd24e5494" title=

"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>fastened up an elephant that was in heat on the
road. From the noise of the horses&rsquo; hoofs and the movement of the
horsemen he attempted to break his chain. On this account a great noise
and confusion took place. When this noise reached the ear of the
eunuch, he in a state of bewilderment awoke S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was asleep or in the insensibility of wine, and
said: &ldquo;An elephant in heat has got loose and is coming in this
direction.&rdquo; As soon as he heard this he became confused and threw
himself down from the front of the chaukandi. When he threw himself off
his toe struck against a stone and was torn open, and he died in two or
three days of that same wound. In short, from hearing this affair I was
completely bewildered. That a brave man on the mere hearing of a cry or
a word coming from a child should become so confused and throw himself
down without control from the top of an elephant is in truth a matter
of amazement. The news of this event reached me on the 19th of the
month of T&#299;r. I consoled his sons with kindnesses and the
conferring of offices. If this accident had not happened to him, as he
had done notable service, he would have obtained exaltation with
greater favours and kindnesses.</p>

asked for leave to depart. As in the time of my father there had been
given to his father 100 horses, I gave him the same number as well as
an elephant, and while he was at Court bestowed on him dresses of
honour and a jewelled dagger. Also to his brothers I gave dresses of

M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam. Having raised his rank from 5,000 personal and
1,500 horse to 5,000 personal and horse, on the 26th
Jum&#257;d&#257;-s&#804;-s&#804;&#257;n&#299;, corresponding to the 2nd
S&#863;hahr&#299;war, I gave him the government of Patna, and bestowing
on him a special elephant, a horse with a jewelled saddle, a jewelled
sword, and a superb dress of honour, I dismissed him. His sons and the
sons of his brother Muzaffar H&#803;usain K&#863;h&#257;n
M&#299;rz&#257;&#702;&#299; were exalted with increased rank,
elephants, horses, and dresses of honour, and sent off with him. I
appointed R&#257;y Dul&#299;p to support M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam. As his
residence was near that place, he collected a good body of men for that
service. I increased his rank by 500 personal and horse, so that it
became 2,000 with 1,000 horse, and also gave him an elephant.
Ab&#363;-l-fath&#803; Dakhan&#299; had obtained a jagir in the Sarkar
of Nagpur and that neighbourhood. He was dismissed in order that he
might administer his jagir and look to the guarding and government of
that country as well. K&#863;husrau B&#299; &#362;zbeg was appointed to
the faujd&#257;rship of the Sarkar of Mewar. His rank of 800 personal
and 300 horse was now increased to 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and I
also presented him with a horse. As I had my eye on the old service of
Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n, it occurred to me that I must not pass by the
desire of his heart. I had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href=
"#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>increased his rank and he had
obtained good jagirs, but he longed for a standard and drums, and he
was now honoured with these as well. &#7778;&#257;lih&#803;, the
adopted son of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Beg-M&#299;rz&#257; &#7778;afaw&#299;,
was a youth of great bravery and zeal. I gave him the title of
K&#863;hanjar K&#863;h&#257;n, and made him eager in the service.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 22nd S&#863;hahr&#299;war,
corresponding with 17th Rajab, 1021, the feast of my solar weighing
took place in the house of Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;. It is an approved
custom with me to weigh myself in this manner. The late king Akbar, who
was the place of manifestation of kindness and grace, also approved of
the custom, and twice in every year weighed himself against several
sorts of metals, gold, silver, and many precious articles, once
according to the solar and once according to the lunar year, and
divided their total value, which was worth about a lakh of rupees,
among faqirs and needy people. I also observe this annual custom and
weigh myself in the same manner, and give those valuables to faqirs.
Mu&#703;taqid K&#863;h&#257;n, Diwan of Bengal, who had been relieved
from that service, produced before me the sons and brothers and some of
the servants of &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n, whom Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n
had sent with him to the Court. The charge of each one of the Afghans
was entrusted to a responsible servant. Then he (Mu&#703;taqid)
produced his own offering, which consisted of twenty-five elephants,
two rubies, a jewelled <i>ph&#363;l ka&#7789;&#257;ra</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5567src" href="#xd24e5567" name=
"xd24e5567src">34</a> (a kind of dagger), trustworthy eunuchs, Bengal
stuffs, etc. M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n, son of Sult&#804;&#257;n
K&#863;hw&#257;ja, who was in the Deccan army, obtained the honour of
kissing the threshold and gave a ruby as an offering. As between
Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, leader of the army of Bangas&#863;h
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>on the borders of Kabul, and the Amirs of that
Subah who had been sent as companions to him under his leadership,
there were quarrels, especially with K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n, I
sent K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n to make enquiry as to which side was
in fault. On the 11th of the month of Mihr, Mu&#703;taqid
K&#863;h&#257;n was appointed to the high dignity of bakhshi, and his
mansab was raised to 1,000 personal and 300 horse. Raising for the
second time the mansabs of Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n a little, I made it
2,500 personal and 1,500 horse by an increase of 500. On the
representation of the Khankhanan, Far&#299;d&#363;n K&#863;h&#257;n
Barl&#257;s was raised to the mansab, original and increase, of 2,500
personal and 2,000 horse. R&#257;y Manohar received that of 1,000
personal and 800 horse, and R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo that of 4,000
personal and 2,200 horse. Bh&#257;rat, grandson of R&#257;mchand
Band&#299;lah, I, after the latter&rsquo;s death, honoured with the
title of Raja. On the 28th &#256;b&#257;n, Zafar K&#863;h&#257;n,
having come according to summons from the Subah of Gujarat, waited on
me. He brought as offerings a ruby and three pearls. On the 6th
&#256;z&#817;ar, corresponding with the 3rd S&#863;haww&#257;l, news
came from Burhanpur that the Am&#299;ru-l-umar&#257; had died on
Sunday, the 27th &#256;b&#257;n, in the parganah of Nih&#257;lp&#363;r.
After the illness he had at Lahore his intelligence appeared to be
less, and a great loss of memory happened to him. He was very sincere.
It is sad that he left no son capable of patronage and favour.
Ch&#299;n Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n came from his father, who was at
Peshawar, on the 20th &#256;z&#817;ar, and offered (on his
father&rsquo;s behalf) 100 muhrs and 100 rupees, and also presented the
offerings he had of his own in the shape of a horse and cloth stuffs
and other things. To the government of Behar I promoted Zafar
K&#863;h&#257;n, who is one of the trustworthy house-born ones and
foster-children, and increasing his mansab by 500 personal and horse, I
made it up to 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, and also honouring his
brothers with robes of honour and horses, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>allowed them to go
off to that province. He had always hoped that he might obtain some
separate service in order that he might show his natural ability. I
also desired to prove him and make this service the touchstone by which
to try him. As it was the season for travelling and hunting, on
Tuesday, the 2nd Z&#817;&#299;-l-qa&#703;da (25th December, 1612),
corresponding with the 4th Day, I left Agra with the intention of
hunting and encamped in the Dahrah garden, remaining there four
days.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5580src" href="#xd24e5580" name=
"xd24e5580src">35</a> On the 10th of the same month the news came of
the death of Sal&#299;ma Sult&#804;&#257;n Begam, who had been ill in
the city. Her mother was Gul-ruk&#863;h Begam, daughter of King
B&#257;bar, and her father M&#299;rz&#257; N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n
Muh&#803;ammad, of the Naqs&#863;hband&#299; K&#863;hw&#257;jas. She
was adorned with all good qualities. In women this degree of skill and
capacity is seldom found. H.M. Hum&#257;y&#363;n, by way of kindness
(to Bair&#257;m), had betrothed her who was his sister&rsquo;s daughter
to Bair&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n. After his death, in the beginning of
the reign of the late king Akbar, the marriage took place. After the
said <span class="corr" id="xd24e5589" title=
"Source: Khan">K&#863;h&#257;n</span> had been killed, my revered
father married her himself. She received mercy (died) in the 60th year
of her age.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5593src" href="#xd24e5593" name=

and sent I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah to bury her (lit. lift her up),
and ordered him to place her in the building in the Mand&#257;kar
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=

of the month of Day, M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Al&#299; Beg
Akbars&#863;h&#257;h&#299; came from the army of the Deccan and waited
on me. K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, whom I had despatched to the Subah
of Kabul, returned on the 21st of the same month and waited on me. The
time for his going and coming had extended to three months and eleven
days. He brought twelve muhrs and twelve rupees as an offering. On the
same day R&#257;ja R&#257;m D&#257;s also came from the victorious army
of the Deccan and paid his respects, and made an offering of 101 muhrs.
As robes of honour for the winter season had not been sent to the Amirs
of the Deccan, they were forwarded by the hand of H&#803;ay&#257;t
K&#863;h&#257;n. As the port of Surat had been assigned in jagir to
Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, he prayed that Ch&#299;n Qil&#299;j (his
son) might be despatched for its guardianship and administration. On
the 27th Day he had a dress of honour, and being honoured with a dress
of honour and the title of K&#863;h&#257;n, and a standard, obtained
leave to go. For the purpose of advising the Amirs of Kabul, and on
account of the disagreements that had sprung up between them and
Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, I sent R&#257;ja R&#257;m D&#257;s, and
bestowed on him a horse and robe of honour and 30,000 rupees for
expenses. On the 6th Bahman, when my camp was in the parganah of
B&#257;r&#299;, there came the news of the death of
K&#863;hw&#257;jag&#299; Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain, who was of the
ancient servants of this State. His elder brother, Muh&#803;ammad
Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n, in the time of my revered father, found
great favour, and K&#863;hw&#257;ja Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain as well
was one of his confidential servants, and held employments such as that
of superintendent of the kitchen (<i>bak&#257;wul</i>) and such like.
He left no son and was beardless, and not a single hair of moustache or
whiskers appeared on him. At the time of speaking he spoke very
shrilly, and was looked upon as an eunuch. S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z
K&#863;h&#257;n, whom the Khankhanan had sent from Burhanpur to make
certain representations, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href=
"#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>came on the 15th of the same month
and waited on me. He presented 100 muhrs and 100 rupees. As the affairs
of the Deccan, in consequence of the hasty proceedings of
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n and the treachery of the Amirs, did not
present a good prospect, the Dakhanis obtained an opportunity for
speaking and began to talk of peace to the Amirs and well-wishers
there. &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n embraced the robe of loyalty,
and prayed that if the affairs of the Deccan were entrusted to him he
would so arrange that some of the districts which had been taken out of
the possession of the officers of the State should be restored. The
loyal ones, looking to the necessities of the time, represented this,
and a settlement of some kind was arrived at, and the Khankhanan
undertook to settle matters. The K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am was
also desirous of putting down the rebel R&#257;n&#257;, and begged for
this service by way of obtaining merit (as a
<i>g&#863;h&#257;z&#299;</i>). He was ordered to go to Malwa, which was
his jagir, and after arranging matters there to take up this duty. The
mansab of Ab&#363;-l-b&#299; Uzbeg<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5615src"
href="#xd24e5615" name="xd24e5615src">37</a> was increased by 1,000
personal and 500 horse to 4,000 personal and 3,500 horse. My hunting
went on for 2 months and 20 days, and during that time I went out every
day to hunt. As not more than 50 or 60 days remained before the
world-illumining New Year, I returned, and on the 24th Isfandiy&#257;r
encamped in the Dahrah garden. The courtiers and some of the
mansabdars, who by order had remained in the city, came on that day and
waited on me. Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n presented a decorated jar, Frank
hats, and a jewelled sparrow (?). I remained three days in the garden,
and on the 27th Isfandiy&#257;r entered the city. During this
time<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5622src" href="#xd24e5622" name=
"xd24e5622src">38</a> 223 head of deer, etc., 95 nilgaw, 2 boars, 36

Blochmann, p. 520, on the authority of the
Mak&#863;hzan-i-Afg&#863;h&#257;n&#299;, says the fight took place 100
kos from Dacca and in a place called Nek Ujy&#257;l, and he points out
in a note that there are several Ujy&#257;ls in Eastern Bengal.
Possibly Adh&#257;r is Udh&#257;r or Uz&#257;r, and a corruption of
Ujy&#257;l. The &lsquo;hills of Dacca,&rsquo; referred to by Blochmann,
might be Ran Bhawal or the Madh&#363;p&#363;r jungle. The
Riy&#257;z&#803;u-s-sal&#257;t&#804;&#299;n does not mention the site
of the battle, and the translator, Maulaw&#299;
&#703;Abdu-s-Sal&#257;m, has in his note at p. 175 confounded two
&#703;&#298;s&#257; K&#863;h&#257;ns, and so drawn groundless
inferences. Blochmann points out, p. 520, that the
Ma&#702;&#257;s&#804;iru-l-umar&#257; says the prisoners were
afterwards put to death. The passage is at vol. ii, p. 632. It says
they were put to death by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s orders by
&#703;Abdu-llah (who certainly was brute enough for anything).
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, T&#363;zuk, p. 112, mentions the arrival of
&#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n&rsquo;s sons and brothers at Court, so that
Blochmann&rsquo;s statement at p. 520 about their being executed on the
road is not correct. It appears, too, they came to Court after
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at&rsquo;s death. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r says
(T&#363;zuk, p. 112) he made over the prisoners to responsible servants
of government. &#703;Abdu-llah may have been one of these, and have got
rid of his prisoners by killing them. It would appear that the battle
with &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n took place to the east or south-east of
Dacca, and not near Orissa, as Stewart supposed.&nbsp;<a class=

to tie a knot in the quiver-girdle of the Gemini.&rdquo; The
appositeness of the <i>f&#257;l</i> is not very apparent, but the

was Arjumand B&#257;n&#363; or Mumt&#257;z-mah&#803;all, the favourite
wife of S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n and the mother of fourteen of his
children. She was the niece of N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n, her father being
N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s brother, the &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n IV and Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan of Beale, who also had
the names of I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n and
Yam&#299;nu-d-daulah. There is an account of the betrothal and wedding
in the P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h-n&#257;ma, i, 388. It seems that the
betrothal took place five years and three months before the marriage,
and when S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n was 15 years old. At the time of
the marriage S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n was 20 years and 3 months old
and Arjumand B&#257;n&#363; was 19 years and 1 month. 18th
K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d, 1021, would correspond to about the end of
May, 1612, but the P&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h-n&#257;ma gives the eve of
Friday, 9th Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal of 1021, corresponding to 22nd
Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, as the day of the marriage. This would
correspond to 30th April, 1612, so that apparently
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s visit to the house (apparently
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah&rsquo;s, but possibly S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s) took place about a month after the marriage.
Arjumand B&#257;n&#363; died in childbed at Burhanpur in 1040, or July,
1631, the chronogram being one word, viz. <i>g&#863;ham</i>,
&lsquo;grief.&rsquo; She must have been born in 1591, and was in her
40th year when she died. She was not S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s
first wife, for he was married to the daughter of Muz&#804;affar
H&#803;usain &#7778;afaw&#299;, a descendant of S&#863;h&#257;h
Isma&#703;&#299;l of Persia, in September, 1610 (Rajab, 1019), but the
betrothal to Arjumand was earlier than this. It was in Arjumand&rsquo;s
honour that the T&#257;j was built.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

&#703;Al&#299; Ah&#803;mad died suddenly two years before this, unless
indeed the passage at p. 169 refers to the mimic and not to
&#703;Al&#299; Ah&#803;mad. Probably the meaning is that &#703;Al&#299;
Ah&#803;mad had made this couplet on some previous occasion, and that
one of the courtiers now quoted it. His verse about the hundred murders
may contain a play on the word <i>k&#863;h&#363;n</i>,
&lsquo;blood,&rsquo; and refer to the spilling of the blood-like wine.
It is difficult to understand how Jah&#257;ng&#299;r came to introduce
the verse into his Memoirs here. It does not seem to have any
connection with the account of the Raja of Kumaon. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
says it was quoted &lsquo;incidentally,&rsquo; <i>b&#257;
taqarrub&#299;</i>. Perhaps the word here means &lsquo;by way of
parody,&rsquo; or &lsquo;by way of paraphrase.&rsquo; In the MS. used
by Erskine the words of the first line seem to be <i>Maguz&#817;ar
Mas&#299;h&#803; bar sar-i-m&#257;</i>, and so Erskine translates
&ldquo;Pass not, O Messiah, over the heads of us victims of

<h2 class="main">The Eighth New Year after the auspicious
Accession.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The eighth year after my accession, corresponding
with Muh&#803;arram, 1022. On the night of Thursday, the 27th
Muh&#803;arram, corresponding with the 1st Farward&#299;n in the eighth
year after my accession, after 3&frac12; gharis of day had elapsed, his
honour the sun passed from the constellation of Pisces to that of
Aries, which is his abode of rejoicing and victory. Early in the
morning of the New Year&rsquo;s Day the feast was prepared and adorned
after the custom of every year. At the end of that day I sat on the
throne of State, and the Amirs and ministers of the State and the
courtiers of the palace came to salute and congratulate me. On these
days of happy augury I sat the whole day in the public audience hall.
Those who had anything to ask or claim presented their petitions, and
the offerings of the servants of the palace were laid before me.
Ab&#363;-l-b&#299;, governor of Qandahar, had sent for an offering Iraq
horses and hunting dogs, and they were brought before me. On the 9th of
the same month Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n came from the Subah of
Behar, and in waiting on me presented 100 muhrs and 100 rupees, as well
as an elephant. On the 12th the offering of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah
was laid before me, consisting of jewels, cloths, and other things.
That which pleased me attained to the dignity of acceptance. Of the
elephants of Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s offering ten others
were inspected on this day. On the 13th the offerings of Tarbiyat
K&#863;h&#257;n were laid before me. Mu&#703;taqid K&#863;h&#257;n
bought a house at Agra, and passed some days in that place. Misfortunes
happened to him one after another. We have heard that prosperity and
bad luck depend on four things: first, upon your wife; second, upon
your slave; third upon your house; fourth, upon your horse. In order to
know the prosperity or ill-luck of a house a rule has been established,
indeed they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>say it is infallible. One must clear a small
piece of the site from earth, and again strew the earth upon the same
ground. If it cover it, one may call it middling good fortune for that
house, neither prosperity nor misfortune; if it become less (i.e. does
not cover it exactly) it points to ill-luck, and if it does more (than
cover it) it is fortunate and auspicious. On the 14th the mansab of
I&#703;tib&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n was raised from 1,000 and 300 horse
to 2,000 personal and 500 horse. I increased the mansab of Tarbiyat
K&#863;h&#257;n by 500 personal and 50 horse, so that it became 2,000
personal and 850 horse. H&#363;s&#863;hang, son of Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was in Bengal with his father, came at this time
and paid his respects. He brought with him some Maghs, whose country is
near Pegu and Arracan, and the country is still in their possession. I
made some enquiries as to their customs and religion. Briefly they are
animals in the form of men. They eat everything there is either on land
or in the sea, and nothing is forbidden by their religion. They eat
with anyone. They take into their possession (marry) their sisters by
another mother. In face they are like the Qar&#257; Qalm&#257;qs, but
their language is that of Tibet and quite unlike Turk&#299;. There is a
range of mountains, one end of which touches the province of
K&#257;s&#863;hg&#863;har and the other the country of Pegu. They have
no proper religion or any customs that can be interpreted as religion.
They are far from the Musulman faith and separated from that of the
Hindus.</p>
<p class="par">Two or three days before the S&#863;haraf (the
sun&rsquo;s highest point) my son K&#863;hurram desired me to go to his
house that he might present his New Year&rsquo;s offerings from that
place. I agreed to his request, and remained for one day and one night
at his house. He presented his offerings. I took what I approved of and
gave him back the rest. The next day Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n
presented his offerings. Every day until the day of culmination
(<i>r&#363;z-i-s&#863;haraf</i>) the offerings of one or of two or
three of the Amirs were laid before me. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>On Monday, the 19th
Farward&#299;n, the assembly of the S&#863;haraf was held. On that
auspicious day I sat on the throne of State, and an order was given
that they should produce all sorts of intoxicating things, such as
wine, etc., so that every one according to his desire might take what
he liked. Many took wine. The offerings of Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n
were on this day brought to me. I gave one gold muhr of 1,000 tolas,
which is called the star of destiny
(<i>kaukab-i-t&#804;&#257;li&#703;</i>), to Y&#257;dg&#257;r
&#703;Al&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, the ambassador of the ruler of Iran.
The feast went off well. After the assembly broke up I ordered that
they might carry off the furniture and decorations. The offering of the
Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n had not been arranged on New Year&rsquo;s Day.
All sorts of rareties and excellent presents were now produced which he
had collected together. Amongst others, twelve Iraq and Arab horses
that had been brought in a ship, and jewelled saddles of Frank
workmanship<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5644src" href="#xd24e5644" name=
"xd24e5644src">1</a> were produced before me. To the mansab of
Naw&#257;zis&#863;h K&#863;h&#257;n 500 horse were added so as to make
it one of 2,000 personal and horse. An elephant called Bans&#299;badan,
which Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n had sent from Bengal, was brought to
me and put among my special elephants. On the 3rd
Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, K&#863;hw&#257;ja Y&#257;dg&#257;r, brother of
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, came from Gujarat and waited on me; he
offered 100 Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; muhrs. After he had been in
attendance a few days he was honoured with the title of Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n. As a competent bakhshi had to be sent to the army of
Bangas&#863;h and those regions, I chose Mu&#703;taqid K&#863;h&#257;n
for this duty, and increased his mansab by 300 personal and 50 horse so
that it became 1,500 with 350 horse, and dismissed him. It was settled
that he must go quickly. I sent off Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain
Cheleb&#299;, who understood the purchase of jewels and collecting
curiosities, with money to go by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238"
href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>way of Iraq to Constantinople
and buy and bring for the Sarkar curiosities and rareties. For this
purpose it was necessary that he should pay his respects to the ruler
of Iran. I had given him a letter and a memorandum (of what he was to
procure). Briefly, he saw my brother, S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s,
in Mashhad, and the king enquired from him what kind of things should
be brought for his master&rsquo;s Sarkar. As he was urgent,
Cheleb&#299; showed the list he had brought with him. In that list
there were entered good turquoise and <i>m&#363;m&#299;y&#257;</i>
(bitumen) from the mine of Ispahan. He told him that these two articles
were not to be bought, but he would send them for me. He authorized
Uwais&#299; T&#363;pch&#299; (gunner), who was one of his private
servants, to hand over to him six bags (<i>amb&#257;ncha</i>) of
turquoise earth holding about 30 seers, with 14 tolas of mumiya and
four Iraq horses, one of which was a piebald, and he wrote a letter
containing many, many expressions of friendship. With regard to the
inferior quality of the turquoise dust (<i>k&#863;h&#257;ka</i>) and
the small quantity of mumiya he made many apologies. The khaka appeared
very inferior. Although the jewellers and makers of rings made every
endeavour, no stone that was fit to be made into a finger ring could be
produced. Probably in these days turquoise dust is not procurable from
the mines such as it was in the time of the late king
T&#804;ahm&#257;sp. He mentioned all this in the letter. With regard to
the effect of mumiya I had heard much from scientists, but when I tried
it no result was apparent. I do not know whether physicians have
exaggerated its effect, or whether its efficacy had been lessened by
its being stale. At any rate, I gave it to a fowl with a broken leg to
drink in larger quantity than they said and in the manner laid down by
the physicians, and rubbed some on the place where it was broken, and
kept it there for three days, though it was said to be sufficient to
keep it from morning till evening. But after I had examined it, no
effect was produced, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href=
"#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>the broken place remained as it
was.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5669src" href="#xd24e5669" name=

&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n and gave another to Qil&#299;j
K&#863;h&#257;n. I ordered that assignments
(<i>tank&#863;hw&#257;h</i>) should be made to 12,000 horse on the
establishment<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5686src" href="#xd24e5686"
name="xd24e5686src">3</a> of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n at the
rate of three horses and two horses for each trooper. As previously
with a view to service in Junagarh I had increased the mansab of his
brother Sard&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n by 500 personal and 300 horse, and
had afterwards assigned the duty to K&#257;mil K&#863;h&#257;n, I
ordered that he should retain his increase and that it should be
counted (permanently) in his mansab. I increased the rank of
Sarfar&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n, which was that of 1,500 personal and 500
horse, by 200 horse more. On the 27th Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht,
corresponding with the 26th Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal, in the eighth
year of my reign, in the year 1022 of the Hijra era, on Thursday, the
meeting for my lunar weighing took place in the house of
Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299; (his mother). Some of the money that was
weighed I ordered to be given to the women and the deserving ones who
had assembled in my mother&rsquo;s house. On the same day I increased
by 1,000 the mansab of Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, so that it
came to 6,000 personal and 5,000 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240"
href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>horse. K&#863;husrau Beg, a
slave of M&#299;rz&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, came from Patna in the
company of &#703;Abdu-r-Razz&#257;q Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299; and waited
on me, and Sard&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, brother of &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n, obtained leave to go to Ahmadabad. An Afghan had
brought from the Carnatic two goats that had <i>p&#257;zahar</i>
(bezoar stones, an antidote against poison). I had always heard that an
animal that has pazahar is very thin and miserable, but these goats
were very fat and fresh. I ordered them to kill one of them, which was
a female. Four pazahar stones became apparent, and this caused great
astonishment.</p>
<p class="par">It is an established fact that cheetahs in unaccustomed
places do not pair off with a female, for my revered father once
collected together 1,000 cheetahs. He was very desirous that they
should pair, but this in no way came off. He had many times coupled
male and female cheetahs together in gardens, but there, too, it did
not come off. At this time a male cheetah, having slipped its collar,
went to a female and paired with it, and after two and a half months
three young ones were born and grew up. This has been recorded because
it appeared strange. As cheetahs did not pair with cheetahs, (still
less) had it ever been heard in former times(?) that tigers mated in
captivity. As in the time of my reign wild beasts have abandoned their
savagery, tigers have become so tame that troops of them without chains
or restraint go about amongst the people, and they neither harm men nor
have any wildness or alarm. It happened that a tigress became pregnant
and after three months bore three cubs; it had never happened that a
wild tiger after its capture had paired. It had been heard from
philosophers that the milk of a tigress was of great use for
brightening eyes. Although we made every effort that the moisture of
milk should appear in her breasts, we could not accomplish it. It
occurs to me that as it is a raging creature, and milk appears in the
breasts of mothers by reason of the affection they have for their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>young, as milk<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5713src" href="#xd24e5713" name="xd24e5713src">4</a> comes into
their breasts in connection with their young ones drinking and sucking
at the time of their taking (the milk), their (the mothers&rsquo;) rage
increases and the milk in their breasts is dried up.</p>
<p class="par">At the end of Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Q&#257;sim, brother of K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z,
who is of the Naqs&#863;hband&#299; K&#863;hw&#257;jas, came from
M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr and waited on me. After a few days
12,000 rupees were given to him as a present. As K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Jah&#257;n had made a melon-bed in the neighbourhood of the city, when
two watches of day had passed on Thursday, the 10th
K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d, I got into a boat and went to inspect the
melon-bed, and took the ladies with me. We reached there when two or
three gharis of day were left, and passed the evening in walking among
the beds. A wonderfully sharp wind and whirlwind sprang up, so that the
tents and screens fell down. I got into the boat and passed the night
in it. I also passed part of the Friday in walking about the melon-bed,
and returned to the city. Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n, who for a long
time had been afflicted with boils and other sores, died on the 10th
K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d. I transferred the jagir and hereditary land of
R&#257;ja Jagman, who had failed in his service in the Deccan, to
Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n. S&#863;haik&#863;h P&#299;r, who is one
of the emancipated ones who hold aloof from the attachments of the age,
and who on account of the pure friendship that he bears towards me has
chosen to be my companion and servant, had before this founded a mosque
in the parganah of Mairtha, which is his native place. At this time he
took occasion to mention the circumstance. As I found his mind bent on
the completion of this building I gave him 4,000 rupees, so that he
himself might go and expend it, and also gave him a valuable
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>shawl and dismissed him. In the public audience
hall there were two railings (<i>mah&#803;jar</i>) of wood. Inside the
first, Amirs, ambassadors, and people of honour sat, and no one entered
this circle without an order. Within the second railing, which is
broader than the first, the mansabdars of inferior rank,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5729src" href="#xd24e5729" name="xd24e5729src">5</a>
ahadis, and those who had work to do are admitted. Outside this railing
stand the servants of the Amirs and all the people who may enter the
Diwankhana. As there was no difference between the first and second
railings, it occurred to me that I should decorate the first with
silver. I ordered this railing and the staircase that led from this
railing to the balcony of the Jharokha, as well as the two elephants
placed on the two sides of the seat of the Jharokha, which skilful
people had made of wood, to be decorated with silver. After this was
completed it was reported to me that 125 maunds of silver in Hindustani
weight, equal to 880 maunds of Persia, had been used up; indeed, it now
assumed a worthy appearance.</p>
<p class="par">On the 3rd of the month of T&#299;r, Muz&#804;affar
K&#863;h&#257;n came from Thatta<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5737src"
href="#xd24e5737" name="xd24e5737src">6</a> and waited on me. He made
an offering of twelve muhrs and a Koran with a jewelled cover, and two
jewelled roses(?) (<i>d&#363; gul</i>). On the 14th of the same month
&#7778;afdar K&#863;h&#257;n came from the Subah of Behar and waited on
me, offering 101 muhrs. After Muz&#804;affar K&#863;h&#257;n had been
some days in attendance, I increased his former mansab by 500 personal,
and giving him a standard and a private shawl dismissed him to
Thatta.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5743src" href="#xd24e5743" name=
"xd24e5743src">7</a></p>
<p class="par">I knew that every animal or living thing bitten by a mad
dog died, but this had not been ascertained in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>the
case of an elephant. In my time it so happened that one night a mad dog
came into the place where was tied one of my private elephants,
Gajpat&#299;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5750src" href="#xd24e5750"
name="xd24e5750src">8</a> by name, and bit the foot of a female
elephant that was with mine. She at once cried out. The
elephant-keepers at once ran in, and the dog fled away into a
thorn-brake that is there. After a little while it came in again and
bit my private elephant&rsquo;s fore-foot as well. The elephant killed
it. When a month and five days had passed after this event, one day
when it was cloudy the growling of thunder came to the ear of the
female elephant, that was in the act of eating, and it of a sudden
raised a cry and its limbs began to tremble. It threw itself on the
ground, but rose again. For seven days water ran out of its mouth, then
suddenly it uttered a cry and showed distress. The remedies the drivers
gave it had no effect, and on the eighth day it fell and died. A month
after the death of the female elephant they took the large elephant to
the edge of the river in the plain. It was cloudy and thundery in the
same way. The said elephant in the height of excitement all at once
began to tremble and sat down on the ground. With a thousand
difficulties the drivers took it to its own place. After the same
interval and in the same way that had happened to the female elephant
this elephant also died. Great amazement was caused by this affair, and
in truth it is a matter to be wondered at that an animal of such size
and bulk should be so much affected by a little wound inflicted on it
by such a weak creature.</p>
<p class="par">As K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;nan had repeatedly
begged for leave to be given to his son S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z
K&#863;h&#257;n, on the 4th Amurd&#257;d I gave him a horse and a robe
of honour and dismissed him to the Deccan. I promoted Ya&#703;q&#363;b
Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;, whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244"
href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>mansab was 150, to 1,500
personal and 1,000 horse, on account of the bravery he had displayed,
and gave him the title of K&#863;h&#257;n as well as a standard.</p>
<p class="par">The Hindus are in four divisions, and each of these acts
according to its own rules and ways. In every year they keep a fixed
day. The first is the caste of the Brahmans,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5759src" href="#xd24e5759" name="xd24e5759src">9</a> that is
those who know the Incomparable God. Their duties are of six
kinds&mdash;(1) to acquire religious knowledge, (2) to give
instructions to others, (3) to worship fire, (4) to lead men to the
worship of fire, (5) giving something to the needy, (6) taking gifts.
There is for this caste an appointed day, and that is the last day of
the month of S&#257;wan, the second month of the rainy season.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5762src" href="#xd24e5762" name=
"xd24e5762src">10</a> They consider this an auspicious day, and the
worshippers go on that day to the banks of rivers and tanks, and recite
enchantments, breathe upon cords and coloured threads; on another day,
which is the first of the New Year, they fasten them on the hands of
the Rajas and great men of the time, and look on them as (good) omens.
They call this thread <i>r&#257;kh&#299;</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5768src" href="#xd24e5768" name="xd24e5768src">11</a> that is,
preservation (<i>nig&#257;h-d&#257;s&#863;ht</i>). This day occurs in
the month of T&#299;r, when the world-heating sun is in the
constellation of Cancer. The second caste is that of the Chhatr&#299;,
which is known as Khatr&#299;. Their duty is to protect the oppressed
from the evil of the oppressors. The customs of this caste are three
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>things&mdash;(1) that they study religious
science themselves but do not teach others; (2) that they worship fire,
but do not teach others to do so; (3) that they give to the needy, but
although they are needy take nothing themselves. The day of this caste
is the <i>Bijay dasam&#299;n</i>, &lsquo;the victorious
tenth.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5786src" href="#xd24e5786"
name="xd24e5786src">12</a> On this day with them it is lucky to mount
and go against one&rsquo;s enemy with an army. R&#257;m Chand, whom
they worship as their god, leading his army on that day against his
enemy won a victory, and they consider this a great day, and,
decorating their elephants and horses, perform worship. This day falls
in the month of S&#863;hahr&#299;war,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5789src" href="#xd24e5789" name="xd24e5789src">13</a> when the
Sun is in the mansion of Virgo, and on it they give presents to those
who look after their horses and elephants. The third caste is that of
Bais&#863;h (Vais&#863;hya)<span class="corr" id="xd24e5798" title=
"Not in source">.</span> Its custom is this, that they serve the other
two castes of which mention has been made. They practise agriculture
and buying and selling, and are employed in the business of profit and
interest. This caste has also a fixed day which they call the
Dew&#257;l&#299;; this day occurs in the month of Mihr when the sun is
in the constellation of Libra, the 28th day of the lunar month. On the
night of that day they light lamps, and friends and those who are dear
assemble in each other&rsquo;s houses and pass their time busily in
gambling. As the eyes of this caste are on profit and interest, they
consider carrying over and opening new accounts on that day auspicious.
The fourth caste is the Sudras, who are the lowest caste of the Hindus.
They are the servants of all, and derive no profit from those things
which are the specialities of every (other) caste. Thursday is the
Hol&#299;, which in their belief is the last day of the year. This day
occurs in the month of Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;, when the sun is in the
constellation of Pisces. On the night of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>this day they light
fires at the head of the streets and ways, and when it becomes day they
for one watch scatter the ashes on each other&rsquo;s heads and faces,
and make a wonderful noise and disturbance, and after this wash
themselves, put on their apparel, and walk about in the gardens and on
the plains. As it is an established custom of the Hindus to burn the
dead, to light fires on this night, which is the last night of the year
that has passed, signifies that they burn the last year, which has gone
to the abode of the dead. In the time of my revered father the Hindu
Amirs and others in imitation of them performed the ceremony of rakhi
in adorning him, making strings of rubies and royal pearls and flowers
jewelled with gems of great value and binding them on his auspicious
arms. This custom was carried on for some years. As they carried this
extravagance to excess, and he disliked it, he forbade it. The brahmans
by way of auguries used to tie these strings and (pieces of) silk
according to their custom. I also in this year carried out this
laudable religious practice, and ordered that the Hindu Amirs and the
heads of the caste<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5804src" href=
"#xd24e5804" name="xd24e5804src">14</a> should fasten rakhis on my
arms. On the day of the rakhi, which was the 9th Amurd&#257;d, they
performed the same rites, and other castes by way of imitation did not
give up this bigotry; this year I agreed to it, and ordered that the
brahmans should bind strings (of cotton) and silk after the ancient
manner. On this day by chance fell the anniversary of the death of the
late king.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5813src" href="#xd24e5813" name=
"xd24e5813src">15</a> The commemoration of such an anniversary is one
of the standing rules and customs in Hindustan. Every year on the day
of the death of their fathers and those who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>are
dear to them, each according to his circumstances and ability prepares
food and all kinds of perfumes, and the learned men, the respectable
and other men assemble, and these assemblies sometimes last a week. On
this day I sent B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram to the venerated tomb to
arrange the assemblage, and 10,000 rupees were given to ten trustworthy
servants to divide among fakirs and those who were in want.</p>
<p class="par">On the 15th of the month of Amurd&#257;d the offering of
Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n was laid before me. He had sent 28
elephants, 40 horses of that part of the country which are known as
<i>&#7789;&#257;nghan</i>, 50 eunuchs, 500 <i>parg&#257;la naf&#299;s
sit&#257;rk&#257;n&#775;&#299;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5826src"
href="#xd24e5826" name="xd24e5826src">16</a></p>
<p class="par">It had been made a rule that the events of the Subahs
should be reported according to the boundaries of each, and
news-writers from the Court had been appointed for this duty. This
being the rule that my revered father had laid down, I also observe it,
and much gain and great advantage are to be brought about by it and
information is acquired about the world and its inhabitants. If the
advantages of this were to be written down it would become a long
affair. At this time the news-writer of Lahore reported that at the end
of the month of T&#299;r ten men had gone from the city to
Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d, which lies at a distance of 12 kos. As the air
was very hot, they took shelter under a tree. Soon afterwards wind and
a dust-storm (<i>chakr&#299;</i>) sprang up, and when it blew on that
band of men they trembled, and nine of them died under the tree, and
only one remained alive; he was ill for a long time, and recovered with
great difficulty. In that neighbourhood such bad <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>air
was created that numerous birds who had their nests in that tree all
fell down and died, and that the wild beasts (beasts of the plain,
perhaps cattle) came and threw themselves on to the cultivated fields,
and, rolling about on the grass, gave up their lives. In short, many
animals perished. On Thursday, the 13th Amurd&#257;d, having said my
prayers (lit. counted my rosary), I embarked on board a boat for the
purpose of hunting in the village of Samonagar, which is one of my
fixed hunting-places. On the 3rd S&#863;hahr&#299;war, K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam, whom I had sent for from the Deccan in order to
despatch him to Iraq in company with the ambassador of the ruler of
Iran, came and waited on me at this place. He offered 100 muhrs. As
Samonagar was in Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s jagir, he had
prepared a delightful halting-place there on the bank of the river, and
it pleased me greatly. He presented offerings of an elephant and an
emerald ring. The former was put into my private stud. Up to the 6th
S&#863;hahr&#299;war I was employed in hunting. In these few days 47
head of antelope, male and female, and other animals were killed. At
this time Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n sent as an offering a ruby,
which was accepted. I sent a special sword for Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n. I increased the mansab of Hasan &#703;Al&#299;
Turkum&#257;n, which was 1,000 personal and 700 horse, by 500 personal
and 100 horse. At the end of Thursday, the 20th of the same month, in
the house of Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;, my solar weighing took place. I
weighed myself according to the usual custom against metals and other
things. I had this year attained to the age of 44 solar years. On the
same day Y&#257;dg&#257;r &#703;Al&#299;, ambassador of the ruler of
Iran, and K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, who had been nominated to
accompany him from this side, received their leave to go. On
Y&#257;dg&#257;r &#703;Al&#299; there were bestowed a horse with a
jewelled saddle, a jewelled sword, a vest without sleeves with gold
embroidery, an aigrette with feathers and a <i>j&#299;g&#863;ha</i>
(turban ornament), and 30,000 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249"
href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>rupees in cash, altogether
40,000 rupees, and on K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam a jewelled
<i>khapwa</i> or <i>ph&#363;l ka&#7789;&#257;ra</i> (a sort of dagger)
with a pendant of royal pearls. On the 22nd of the same month I visited
the venerated mausoleum of my revered father at
Bihis&#863;ht&#257;b&#257;d, riding on an elephant. On the way 5,000
rupees in small coin were scattered round, and I gave other 5,000
rupees to K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n to divide among the dervishes.
Having said my evening prayers, I went back to the city in a boat. As
the house of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah was on the bank of the river
Jumna, I alighted there until the end of the next day. Having accepted
what pleased me of his offerings, I went towards the palace;
I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s house was also on the bank of
the river Jumna; at his request I disembarked there with the ladies,
and walked round the houses he had lately built there. This delightful
place pleased me greatly. He had produced suitable offerings of cloth
stuffs and jewels and other things; these were all laid before me and
most of them were approved. When it was near evening I entered the
auspicious palace. As the astrologers had fixed an hour in this night
for starting for Ajmir, when seven gharis of the night of Monday, the
2nd S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n, corresponding with the 24th
S&#863;hahr&#299;war, had passed, I started in happiness and prosperity
with intent to go there from the capital of Agra. In this undertaking
two things were agreeable to me, one a pilgrimage to the splendid
mausoleum of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n
Chis&#863;ht&#299;, from the blessing of whose illustrious soul great
advantages had been derived by this dignified family, and whose
venerable shrine I had not visited after my accession to the throne.
The second was the defeat and beating back of the rebel R&#257;n&#257;
Amar Singh, who is one of the most considerable of the Zamindars and
Rajas of Hindustan, and whose headship and leadership and those of his
ancestors all the Rajas and Rays of this province agree to. The
administration has for long been in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>hands of this family,
and they have long borne rule towards the East, that is the P&#363;rab.
They became in that time well known under the title of Rajas. After
this they fell on the Deccan<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5865src" href=
"#xd24e5865" name="xd24e5865src">17</a> and took possession of many of
the countries of that region. In the place of Raja they have taken the
title of R&#257;wal. After this they came into the hill country of
Mew&#257;t, and by degrees got into their possession the fort of
Chitor. From that date until this day, which is in the eighth year
after my accession, 1,471 years have passed.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5868src" href="#xd24e5868" name="xd24e5868src">18</a></p>
<p class="par">There are twenty-six others of this caste who have ruled
for 1,010 years. They have the title of R&#257;wal, and from the
R&#257;wal who was first known as R&#257;wal down to R&#257;n&#257;
Amar Singh, the present R&#257;n&#257;, there are twenty-six
individuals who have ruled for the space of 461 years. During this long
time they have never bent their necks in obedience to any of the kings
of the country of Hindustan, and have for most of the time been
rebellious and troublesome, so much so that in the reign of the late
king B&#257;bar, R&#257;n&#257; S&#257;ng&#257; collected together all
the Rajas, Rays, and Zamindars of this province, and fought a battle in
the neighbourhood of Biy&#257;na with 180,000 horse and several lakhs
of foot-soldiers. By the aid of Almighty God and the assistance of
fortune the victorious army of Isl&#257;m prevailed against the infidel
forces, and a great defeat happened to them. The details of this battle
have been given in the Memoirs of King B&#257;bar. My revered father
(may his bright tomb be the abode of unending Grace) exerted himself
greatly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>to put down these rebels, and several times sent
armies against them. In the twelfth year after his accession he set
himself to capture the fort of Chitor, which is one of the strongest
forts of the inhabited world, and to overthrow the kingdom of the
R&#257;n&#257;, and after four months and ten days of siege took it by
force from the men of Amar Singh&rsquo;s father, after much fighting,
and returned after destroying the fort. Every time the victorious
forces pressed him hard in order to capture him or make him a fugitive,
but it so happened that this was not effected. In the end of his reign,
on the same day and hour that he proceeded to the conquest of the
Deccan, he sent me with a large army and reliable Sardars against the
R&#257;n&#257;. By chance these two affairs, for reasons which it would
take too long to recount, did not succeed. At last I came to the
throne, and as this matter was only half done, the first army I sent to
the borders was this one. Making my son Parw&#299;z its leader, the
leading nobles who were at the capital were appointed to this duty. I
sent abundant treasure and artillery with him. As every matter depends
on its own season, at this juncture the unhappy affair of K&#863;husrau
occurred, and I had to pursue him to the Panjab. The province and the
capital of Agra remained void. I had necessarily to write that
Parw&#299;z should return with some of the Amirs and take charge of
Agra and the neighbourhood. In short, this time again the matter of the
R&#257;n&#257; did not go off as it should. When by the favour of Allah
my mind was at rest from K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s disturbance, and Agra
became again the alighting place of the royal standards, a victorious
army was appointed under the leadership of Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n, &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, and other leaders,
and from that date up to the time when the royal standards started for
Ajmir his country was trodden under foot by the victorious forces. As
finally the affair did not assume <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252"
href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>an approved form, it occurred
to me that, as I had nothing to do at Agra, and I was convinced that
until I myself went there the affair would not be set to rights, I left
the fort of Agra and alighted at the Dahrah garden. On the next day the
festival of the Dasahr&#257; took place. According to the usual custom
they decorated the elephants and horses, and I had them before me. As
the mothers and sisters of K&#863;husrau repeatedly represented to me
that he was very repentant of his deeds, the feelings (lit. sweat) of
fatherly affection having come into movement, I sent for him and
determined that he should come every day to pay his respects to me. I
remained for eight days in that garden. On the 28th news arrived that
R&#257;ja R&#257;m D&#257;s, who was doing service in Bangash and the
neighbourhood of Kabul with Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, had died. On
the 1st of the month of Mihr I marched from the garden, and dismissed
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n to look after the capital of Agra and
guard the treasure and the palace, and gave him an elephant and a
special robe (<i>fargul</i>). On the 2nd Mihr news arrived that
R&#257;ja B&#257;so had died in the thanah of Shahabad,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5886src" href="#xd24e5886" name=
"xd24e5886src">19</a> which is on the border of the territory of Amar.
On the 10th of the same month I halted at R&#363;p B&#257;s, which has
now been named Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d. Formerly this district had been
given as jagir to R&#363;p K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779;. Afterwards,
bestowing it on Am&#257;nu-llah, son of Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n, I
ordered it to be called by his name. Eleven days were passed at this
halting-place. As it is a fixed hunting-place, I every day mounted to
go hunting, and in these few days 158 antelopes, male and female, and
other animals were killed. On the 25th of the month I marched from
Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d. On the 31st, corresponding with the 8th
Ramaz&#803;&#257;n, K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan, whom I
had sent for from Burhanpur, came and waited on me, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>and
presented as offerings 50 muhrs, 15 jewelled vessels, and an elephant,
which I placed in my private stud. On the 2nd &#256;b&#257;n,
corresponding with the 10th Ramaz&#803;&#257;n, news came of the death
of Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n. He was one of the ancient servants of
the State, and obtained the mercy of God in the 80th year of his age.
He was employed at Peshawar in the duty of keeping in order the Afghans
full of darkness.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5892src" href="#xd24e5892"
name="xd24e5892src">20</a> His rank was 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse.
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n Dakhan&#299; was unrivalled in the
art of <i>p&#363;lta-b&#257;z&#299;</i>, which in the language of the
Dakhanis they call <i>yag&#257;nag&#299;</i>, and the Moguls
<i>s&#863;hams&#863;h&#299;r-b&#257;z&#299;</i>,
&lsquo;sword-play&rsquo; (fencing). For some time I studied it with
him. At this time I exalted him with the title of Warzis&#863;h
K&#863;h&#257;n (Exercise-K&#863;h&#257;n). I had established a custom
that deserving people and dervishes should be brought before me every
night, so that I might bestow on them, after personal enquiry into
their condition, land, or gold, or clothes. Amongst these was a man who
represented to me that the name Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, according to the
science of <i>abjad</i> (numerals reckoned by letters), corresponded to
the great name &ldquo;Allah Akbar.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5907src" href="#xd24e5907" name="xd24e5907src">21</a> Considering
this a good omen, I gave him who discovered (this coincidence) land, a
horse, cash, and clothing. On Monday, the 5th S&#863;haww&#257;l,
corresponding to the 26th &#256;b&#257;n, the hour for entering Ajmir
was fixed. On the morning of the said day I went towards it. When the
fort and the buildings of the shrine of the revered K&#863;hw&#257;ja
appeared in sight, I traversed on foot the remainder of the road, about
a kos. I placed trustworthy men on both sides of the road, who went
along giving money to fakirs and the necessitous. When four gharis of
day had passed, I entered the city and its inhabited portion, and in
the fifth ghari had the honour of visiting the venerated mausoleum.
After visiting it I proceeded to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254"
href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>the auspicious palace, and
the next day ordered all those present in this honoured resting-place,
both small and great, belonging to the city, and travellers, to be
brought before me, that they might be made happy with numerous gifts
according to their real circumstances. On the 7th &#256;z&#817;ar I
went to see and shoot on the tank of Pushkar, which is one of the
established praying-places of the Hindus, with regard to the perfection
of which they give (excellent) accounts that are incredible to any
intelligence, and which is situated at a distance of three kos from
Ajmir. For two or three days I shot water-fowl on that tank, and
returned to Ajmir. Old and new temples which, in the language of the
infidels, they call Deohara<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5913src" href=
"#xd24e5913" name="xd24e5913src">22</a> are to be seen around this
tank. Among them R&#257;n&#257; S&#863;hankar, who is the uncle of the
rebel Amar, and in my kingdom is among the high nobles, had built a
Deohara of great magnificence, on which 100,000 rupees had been spent.
I went to see that temple. I found a form cut out of black stone, which
from the neck above was in the shape of a pig&rsquo;s head, and the
rest of the body was like that of a man. The worthless religion of the
Hindus is this, that once on a time for some particular object the
Supreme Ruler thought it necessary to show himself in this shape; on
this account they hold it dear and worship it.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5916src" href="#xd24e5916" name="xd24e5916src">23</a> I ordered
them to break that hideous form and throw it into the tank. After
looking at this building there appeared a white dome on the top of a
hill, to which men were coming from all quarters. When I asked about
this they said that a Jog&#299; lived there, and when the simpletons
come to see him he places in their hands a handful<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e5919src" href="#xd24e5919" name="xd24e5919src">24</a> of
flour, which they put into their mouths and imitate the cry
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>of an animal which these fools have at some time
injured, in order that by this act their sins may be blotted out. I
ordered them to break down that place and turn the Jog&#299; out of it,
as well as to destroy the form of an idol there was in the dome.
Another belief they have is that there is no bottom to this tank. After
enquiry it appeared that it is nowhere deeper than 12 cubits. I also
measured it round and it was about 1&frac12; kos.</p>
<p class="par">On the 16th &#256;z&#817;ar news came that the watchmen
had marked down a tigress. I immediately went there and killed it with
a gun and returned. After a few days a nilgaw (blue bull) was killed,
of which I ordered them to take off the skin in my presence and cook it
as food for the poor. Over 200 people assembled and ate it, and I gave
money with my own hand to each of them. In the same month news came
that the Franks of Goa had, contrary to treaty, plundered four cargo
vessels<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5932src" href="#xd24e5932" name=
"xd24e5932src">25</a> that frequented the port of Surat in the
neighbourhood of that port: and, making prisoners a large number of
Musulmans, had taken possession of the goods and chattels that were in
those ships. This being very disagreeable to my mind, I despatched
Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n, who is in charge of the port, on the 18th
&#256;z&#817;ar, giving him a horse and elephant and a dress of honour,
to obtain compensation for this affair. On account of the great
activity and good services of Y&#363;suf K&#863;h&#257;n and
Bah&#257;duru-l-mulk in the Subah of the Deccan, I sent standards for
them.</p>
<p class="par">It has been written that my chief object, after my visit
to the K&#863;hw&#257;ja, was to put a stop to the affair of the rebel
R&#257;n&#257;. On this account I determined to remain myself at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>Ajmir and send on B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram,
my fortunate son. This idea was a very good one, and on this account,
on the 6th of Day, at the hour fixed upon, I despatched him in
happiness and triumph. I presented him with a <i>qab&#257;</i> (outer
coat) of gold brocade with jewelled flowers and pearls round the
flowers, a brocaded turban with strings of pearls, a gold woven sash
with chains of pearls, one of my private elephants called Fath&#803;
Gaj, with trappings, a special horse, a jewelled sword, and a jewelled
<i>khapwa</i>, with a <i>ph&#363;l ka&#7789;&#257;ra</i>. In addition
to the men first appointed to this duty under the leadership of
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, I sent 12,000 more horse with my son,
and honoured their leaders, each according to his condition, with
special horses and elephants and robes of honour, and dismissed them.
Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n was nominated to the
paymastership of this army. At the same time &#7778;afdar
K&#863;h&#257;n was despatched to the government of Kashmir in place of
H&#257;shim K&#863;h&#257;n. He received a horse and robe of honour. On
Wednesday, the 11th, K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan was made
general paymaster (<i>bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;-kul</i>), and received a
dress of honour. I had ordered them to make a large caldron<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5958src" href="#xd24e5958" name=
"xd24e5958src">26</a> at Agra for the revered mausoleum of the
K&#863;hw&#257;ja. On this day it was brought, and I ordered them to
cook food for the poor in that pot, and collect together the poor of
Ajmir to feed them whilst I was there. Five thousand people assembled,
and all ate of this food to their fill. After the food I gave money to
each of the dervishes with my own hand. At this time Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of Bengal, was promoted to the mansab of
6,000 personal and horse, and a flag was given to Mukarram
K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Mu&#703;&#257;z&#804;z&#804;am
K&#863;h&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">On the 1st of Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;, corresponding with
the 10th Muh&#803;arram, 1023 (20th February, 1614), I left
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>Ajmir to hunt nilgaw, and returned on the 9th. I
halted at the fountain of H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804; Jam&#257;l,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5971src" href="#xd24e5971" name=
"xd24e5971src">27</a> two kos from the city, and passed the night of
Friday<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5974src" href="#xd24e5974" name=
"xd24e5974src">28</a> there. At the end of the day I entered the city.
In these twenty days ten nilgaw had been killed. As the good service of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n and the smallness of his force for the
defence and government of Agra and that neighbourhood were brought to
my notice, I increased his mansab by 500 personal and 100 horse. On the
same day Ab&#363;-l-fath&#803; Dakhan&#299; came from his jagir and
waited on me. On the 3rd of the same month news came of the death of
Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n; he had died on Thursday, the 5th Rajab, in
the year 1022 (21st August, 1613). In one day, without any previous
illness, this inevitable event occurred. He was one of those born and
brought up in the house (house-born). The naturally good disposition
and knowledge of affairs that showed themselves in him were seen in no
one else. He ruled Bengal with entire authority, and brought within the
civil jurisdiction of the province countries that had never previously
come under the sway of any of the jagirdars or into the possession of
any of the Chiefs of the State. If death had not overtaken him he would
have done perfect service.</p>
<p class="par">The K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am had himself prayed
that the illustrious prince should be appointed to the campaign against
the R&#257;n&#257;, yet, notwithstanding all kinds of encouragement and
gratification on the part of my son (S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n), he
would not apply himself to the task, but proceeded to act in his own
unworthy manner. When this was heard by me, I sent Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
H&#803;usain, who was one of my most trusty attendants, to him, and
sent affectionate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258"
name="pb258">258</a>]</span>messages to him to say that when he was at
Burhanpur he had daily begged this duty of me, as he considered it
equivalent to the happiness of both worlds, and had said in meetings
and assemblies that if he should be killed in this enterprise he would
be a martyr, and if he prevailed, a g&#863;h&#257;z&#299;. I had given
him whatever support and assistance of artillery he had asked for.
After this he had written that without the movement of the royal
standards to those regions the completion of the affair was not free of
difficulty. By his counsel I had come to Ajmir, and this neighbourhood
had been thus honoured and dignified. Now that he had himself prayed
for the prince, and everything had been carried out according to his
counsel, why did he withdraw his foot from the field of battle and
enter the place of disagreement? To B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram, from
whom up till now I had never parted, and whom I sent in pure reliance
on his (K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am&rsquo;s) knowledge of affairs,
he should show loyalty and approved good-will, and never be neglectful
day or night of his duty to my son. If, contrariwise, he should draw
back his foot from what he had agreed to, he must know that there would
be mischief. Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain went, and impressed these
words on his mind in the same detailed way. It was of no avail, as he
would not go back from his folly and determination. When B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram saw that his being in the affair was a cause of
disturbance, he kept him under observation and represented that his
being there was in no way fitting, and he was acting thus and spoiling
matters simply on account of the connection he had with
K&#863;husrau.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5983src" href="#xd24e5983"
name="xd24e5983src">29</a> I then ordered Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n
to go and bring him from Udaipur, and told Muh&#803;ammad Taq&#299;,
the diwan of buildings, to go to Mandes&#363;r and bring his children
and dependants to Ajmir.</p>
<p class="par">On the 11th of the month news came that Dul&#299;p, son
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>of R&#257;y Singh, who was of a seditious and
rebellious disposition, had been heavily defeated by his younger
brother, R&#257;o S&#363;raj Singh, who had been sent against him, and
that he was making disturbance in one of the districts of the Sarkar of
H&#803;i&#7779;&#7779;ar. About this time H&#257;shim of K&#863;host,
the faujd&#257;r, and the jagirdars of that neighbourhood seized him,
and sent him as a prisoner to Court. As he had misbehaved repeatedly,
he was capitally punished, and this was a warning to many of the
seditious. In reward for this service an increase of 500 personal and
200 horse was made to the mansab of R&#257;o S&#363;raj Singh. On the
14th of the month a representation came from my son B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram that the elephant &#703;&#256;lam-gum&#257;n, of which
the R&#257;n&#257; was very fond, together with seventeen other
elephants, had fallen into the hands of the warriors of the victorious
army, and that his master would also soon be captured.</p>

Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s words seem to imply that he caused the
fowl&rsquo;s leg to be broken in order to try the experiment. Manucci,
i, 55, has a good deal to say about <i>m&#363;m&#299;y&#257;</i>,
though he admits that he had not himself witnessed its effects. I do
not find that H&#803;&#257;j&#299; B&#257;b&#257; descants on its
virtues, though at the end of the first chapter he says that his mother
gave him an unguent which she said would cure all fractures. The
Persian translator, no doubt rightly, has rendered the word
&lsquo;unguent&rsquo; by <i>m&#363;m&#299;y&#257;</i>. With regard to
the derivation of the word, may it not be connected with <i>mom</i>,

Jah&#257;ng&#299;r calls the day after the last day of S&#257;wan the
first day of the New Year. Perhaps <i>r&#363;z-i-duyam</i> here means
&lsquo;another day,&rsquo; and not &lsquo;the next day&rsquo;; but
then, if so, why is it the rakhi day, for that is in S&#257;wan? The
Hindu New Year begins in Bais&#257;kh (April). It will be observed from
Jarrett, ii, 17, that S&#257;wan is also the name of a month of a
particular length. Perhaps Jah&#257;ng&#299;r has confused the two
things.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd24e5768src">&uarr;</a></p>

<i>Parg&#257;las</i> seem to be clothes of some sort. Perhaps the word

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The commencement of the ninth year after my
auspicious accession, corresponding with the Hijra year 1023
(1614).</p>
<p class="par">Two watches and one ghari had passed on the night of
Friday, the 9th &#7778;afar (21st March, 1614), when the world-warming
sun shed his rays on the constellation of Aries, which is his house of
dignity and honour; it was the first morning of the month of
Farward&#299;n. The assembly for the New Year&rsquo;s festival took
place in the pleasant regions of Ajmir, and at the time of entry (of
the sun into Aries), which was the propitious hour, I seated myself on
the throne of good fortune. They had in the usual manner decorated the
palace with rare cloth-stuffs and jewels and gem-decked things. At this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>auspicious moment the elephant
&#703;&#256;lam-gum&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5999src" href=
"#xd24e5999" name="xd24e5999src">1</a> which was fit to be entered in
the private stud, with the seventeen other male and female elephants
which my son B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram had sent of the
R&#257;n&#257;&rsquo;s elephants, were presented before me, and the
hearts of the loyal rejoiced. On the 2nd day of the New Year, knowing
it to be propitious for a ride, I mounted it and scattered about much
money. On the 3rd I conferred on I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n a
mansab of 3,000 personal and 1,000 horse, increasing thus that which he
had already, which was of 2,000 personal and 500 horse, and I
distinguished him with the title of &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n,
with which title two of his family had been previously honoured. I also
increased the mansab of Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n by 500 personal
and 200 horse. At the same time I promoted I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah
to the mansab of 5,000 personal and 2,000 horse. At the request of
B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram I increased the mansab of Saif
K&#863;h&#257;n B&#257;rha by 500 personal and 200 horse, that of
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n by the same number, that of Kis&#863;han
Singh by 500 horse, and that of Sarfar&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n by 500
personal and 300 horse. On Sunday, the 10th, the offering of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n was produced before me, and on the 14th
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah produced his own offering. From these two
offerings I took what pleased me and gave back the rest. Ch&#299;n
Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, with his brothers, relations, and the army
and retinue of his father, came from Kabul<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6002src" href="#xd24e6002" name="xd24e6002src">2</a> and waited
on me. Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n, who had a mansab of 700
personal and 300 horse, having been promoted to that of 1,500 personal
and 600 horse, was appointed jointly with K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan to the exalted dignity of paymaster of the
household. On the 15th of this month Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n, who
had been appointed to bring K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am and his
son &#703;Abdu-llah, came and waited <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>on me. On the 19th
the assembly of honour was held. On that day the offering of
Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n was laid before me, and I sent a private
elephant called R&#363;p Sundar for my son Parw&#299;z. When that day
had passed I ordered them to deliver K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am
into the charge of &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, that he might keep
him in the fort of Gwalior. As my object in sending him to the fort was
in case some disagreement and disturbance should occur in the matter of
the R&#257;n&#257; in consequence of the attachment that he had to
K&#863;husrau, I ordered him not to be kept in the fort like a
prisoner, but that they should provide everything necessary for his
comfort and convenience in the way of eating and clothing. On the same
day I promoted Ch&#299;n Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n to a mansab of
2,500 personal and 700 horse. To the rank of T&#257;j K&#863;h&#257;n,
who had been appointed to the charge of the province of Bhakar, I added
500 personal and horse. On the 18th Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht I forbade
K&#863;husrau to pay his respects. The reason was this, that through
the affection and fatherly love (I bore him) and the prayers of his
mother and sisters, I had ordered again that he should come every day
to pay his respects (<i>k&#363;rnis&#863;h</i>). As his appearance
showed no signs of openness and happiness, and he was always mournful
and dejected in mind, I accordingly ordered that he should not come to
pay his respects. In the time of my revered father, Muz&#804;affar
H&#803;usain M&#299;rz&#257; and Rustam M&#299;rz&#257;, sons of
Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain M&#299;rz&#257;, nephews of
S&#863;h&#257;h T&#804;ahm&#257;sp &#7778;afaw&#299;, who had in their
possession Qandahar and Zam&#299;nd&#257;war and that neighbourhood,
sent petitions to the effect that in consequence of the nearness to
Khurasan and the coming of &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n &#362;zbeg
to that country, they could not leave the charge of looking after the
country and come (to pay their respects), but that if he (Akbar) would
send one of the servants of the palace they would hand over the country
to him, and themselves come to pay their respects. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>As
they repeatedly made this request, he sent S&#863;h&#257;h Beg
K&#863;h&#257;n, who is now honoured with the title of K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n, to the governorship of Qandahar and Zam&#299;nd&#257;war
and that neighbourhood, and wrote firmans full of favour to the
M&#299;rz&#257;s summoning them to the Court. After their arrival
favours appropriate to the case of each were bestowed on them, and he
gave them a territory equal to two or three times the collections of
Qandahar. In the end, the management expected from them was not
achieved, and by degrees the territory deteriorated. Muz&#804;affar
H&#803;usain M&#299;rz&#257; died during the lifetime of my revered
father, and he sent M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam with the Khankhanan to the
Subah of the Deccan, where he had a small jagir. When the throne was
honoured by my succession, I sent for him from the Deccan with the
intention of showing him favour and sending him to one of the border
territories. About the time he came M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299; Tark&#863;h&#257;n, who held the governorship of
Thatta and Qandahar and that neighbourhood, died. It occurred to me to
send him to Thatta, so that he might show there his natural good
qualities and administer that country in an approved manner. I promoted
him to a mansab of 5,000 personal and horse, 200,000 rupees were given
to him for expenses, and I despatched him to the Subah of Thatta. My
belief was that he would do good service<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6013src" href="#xd24e6013" name="xd24e6013src">3</a> on those
borders. In opposition to my expectation he did no service, and
committed so much oppression that many people complained of his
wickedness. Such news of him was heard that it was considered necessary
to recall him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>One of the servants of the Court was appointed
to summon him, and I sent for him to Court. On the 26th
Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht they brought him. As he had committed great
oppression on the people of God, and inquiry into this was due
according to the requirements of justice, I handed him over to
An&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299; Singh-dalan that he might enquire into the
facts, and that if guilty he might receive prompt punishment and be a
warning to others. In those days the news also came of the defeat of
Ah&#803;d&#257;d, the Afghan. The facts are that Mu&#703;taqid
K&#863;h&#257;n came to P&#363;lam<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6018src"
href="#xd24e6018" name="xd24e6018src">4</a> Guzar (ferry?), in the
district of Peshawar, with an army, and K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n
with another force in Afghanistan and blocked the path of that rascal
(lit. black-faced one). Meanwhile a letter came to Mu&#703;taqid
K&#863;h&#257;n from Pish Bulagh that Ah&#803;d&#257;d had gone to
Ko&#7789; T&#299;r&#257;h, which is 8 kos from Jalalabad, with a large
number of horse and foot, and had killed a few of those who had chosen
to be loyal and obey, and made prisoners of others, and was about to
send them to T&#299;r&#257;h, and intended to make a raid on Jalalabad
and Pish Bulagh. Immediately on hearing this news Mu&#703;taqid
K&#863;h&#257;n started in great haste with the troops he had with him.
When he arrived at Pish Bulagh he sent out spies to ascertain about the
enemy. On the morning of Wednesday, the 6th, news reached him that
Ah&#803;d&#257;d was in the same place. Placing his trust on the favour
of God, which is on the side of this suppliant at the throne of Allah,
he divided the royal army into two, and went towards the enemy, who,
with 4,000 or 5,000 experienced men, had seated themselves haughtily in
complete carelessness, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href=
"#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>and did not suspect that besides
K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n&rsquo;s there was an army in the
neighbourhood that could oppose itself to them. When news came that the
royal forces were coming against that ill-fortuned man, and the signs
of an army were becoming manifest, in a state of bewilderment he
distributed his men into four bodies, and seating himself on an
eminence a gunshot away, to get to which was a difficult matter, he
sent his men to fight. The musketeers of the victorious army assailed
the rebel with bullets, and sent a large number to hell. Mu&#703;taqid
K&#863;h&#257;n took the centre of his army to his advanced guard, and,
not giving the enemy more than time to shoot off their arrows two or
three times, swept them clean away, and pursuing them for 3 or 4 kos,
killed nearly 1,500 of them, horse and foot. Those left of the sword
took to flight, most of them wounded and with their arms thrown away.
The victorious army remained for the night in the same place on the
battlefield, and in the morning proceeded with 600 decapitated
heads<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6026src" href="#xd24e6026" name=
"xd24e6026src">5</a> towards Peshawar and made pillars of the heads
there. Five hundred horses and innumerable cattle and property and many
weapons fell into their hands. The prisoners of T&#299;r&#257;h were
released, and on this side no well-known men were killed. On the night
of Thursday, the 1st of K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d, I proceeded towards
Pushkar to shoot tigers, and on Friday killed two of them with a gun.
On the same day it was represented to me that Naq&#299;b
K&#863;h&#257;n had died. The aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n was one of the
Saif&#299; Sayyids, and was originally from Qazwin. The tomb of his
father, M&#299;r &#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f, is at Ajmir. Two months
before his death his wife,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6033src" href=
"#xd24e6033" name="xd24e6033src">6</a> between whom and her husband
there was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>a great affection, and who for twelve days was
ill with fever, drank the unpleasant draught of death. I ordered them
to bury him by the side of his wife, whom they had placed in the
K&#863;hw&#257;ja&rsquo;s venerated mausoleum. As Mu&#703;taqid
K&#863;h&#257;n had done approved service in the fight with
Ah&#803;d&#257;d, in reward he was exalted with the title of
Las&#863;hkar K&#863;h&#257;n. Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n, who had
been sent to Udaipur in the service of B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram and
to convey certain orders, came on the 7th K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d and
gave good account of the rules and regulations made by B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram. Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, who in the days
of my princehood was my servant, and whom after my accession I had made
bakhshi in this army, and who had obtained favour, gave up the deposit
of his life on the 12th of the same month. M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam, as
he showed signs of repentance and regret for his misdeeds, and
generosity demanded that his faults should be pardoned, was, in the end
of the month, summoned to my presence, and I satisfied his mind, and
having given him a dress of honour, ordered him to pay his respects to
me. On the night of Sunday, the 11th of the month of T&#299;r, a female
elephant in the private elephant stud gave birth to a young one in my
presence. I had repeatedly ordered them to ascertain the period of
their gestation; at last it became evident that for a female young one
it was 18 months and for a male 19 months. In opposition to the birth
of a human being, which is in most cases by a head delivery, young
elephants are born with their feet first. When the young one was born,
the mother scattered dust upon it with her foot, and began to be kind
and to pet it. The young one for an instant remained fallen, and then
rising, made towards its mother&rsquo;s breasts. On the 14th the
assembly of Gul&#257;b-p&#257;s&#863;h&#299; (sprinkling of rose-water)
took place; from former times this has been known as
<i>&#257;b-p&#257;s&#863;h&#299;</i> (water-sprinkling), and has become
established from amongst customs of former <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=

1614) came news of the death of R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6043src" href="#xd24e6043" name="xd24e6043src">7</a>
The aforesaid Raja was one of the chief officers of my revered father.
As I had sent many servants of the State to serve in the Deccan, I also
appointed him. After his death in that service, I sent for
M&#299;rz&#257; Bh&#257;o Singh, who was his legitimate heir. As from
the time when I was prince he had done much service with me, although
the chiefship and headship of their family, according to the Hindu
custom, should go to Mah&#257; Singh, son<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6046src" href="#xd24e6046" name="xd24e6046src">8</a> of Jagat
Singh, the Raja&rsquo;s eldest son, who had died in the latter&rsquo;s
lifetime, I did not accept him, but I dignified Bh&#257;o Singh with
the title of M&#299;rz&#257; R&#257;ja, and raised him to the mansab of
4,000 personal and 3,000 horse. I also gave him Amber, the native place
of his ancestors, and, soothing and consoling the mind of Mah&#257;
Singh, increased his former mansab by 500, and gave him as an
in&#703;&#257;m the territory of Garha.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6056src" href="#xd24e6056" name="xd24e6056src">9</a> I also sent
him a jewelled dagger belt, a horse, and dress of honour. On the 8th of
this month of Amurd&#257;d I found a change in my health, and by
degrees was seized with fever and headache. For fear that some injury
might occur to the country and the servants of God, I kept this secret
from most of those familiar with and near to me, and did not inform the
physicians and hakims. A few days passed in this manner, and I only
imparted this to N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam than whom I did not think
anyone was fonder of me; I abstained from eating heavy foods, and,
contenting myself with a little light food, went every day, according
to my rule, to the public D&#299;w&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;na (hall of
audience), and entered the Jharokha and <i>ghusal-k&#863;h&#257;na</i>
(parlour) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>in my usual manner, until signs of weakness
showed themselves in my skin.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6064src" href=
"#xd24e6064" name="xd24e6064src">10</a> Some of the nobles<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6067src" href="#xd24e6067" name=
"xd24e6067src">11</a> became aware of this, and informed one or two of
my physicians who were trustworthy, such as H&#803;ak&#299;m
Mas&#299;h&#803;u-z-zam&#257;n, H&#803;ak&#299;m Ab&#363;-l-q&#257;sim,
and H&#803;ak&#299;m &#703;Abdu-s&#863;h-S&#863;hak&#363;r. As the
fever did not change, and for three nights I took my usual wine, it
brought on greater weakness. In the time of disquietude, and when
weakness prevailed over me, I went to the mausoleum of the revered
K&#863;hw&#257;ja, and in that blessed abode prayed to God Almighty for
recovery, and agreed to give alms and charity. God Almighty, in His
pure grace and mercy, bestowed on me the robe of honour of health, and
by degrees I recovered. The headache, which had been very severe,
subsided under the remedies of H&#803;ak&#299;m
&#703;Abdu-s&#863;h-S&#863;hak&#363;r, and in the space of twenty-two
days my state returned to what it was before. The servants of the
palace, and indeed the whole of the people, made offerings for this
great bounty. I accepted the alms of no one, and ordered that everyone
in his own house should distribute what he wished among the poor. On
the 10th S&#863;hahr&#299;war news came that T&#257;j K&#863;h&#257;n,
the Afghan, governor of Thatta,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6072src"
href="#xd24e6072" name="xd24e6072src">12</a> had died; he was one of
the old nobles of the State.</p>
<p class="par">During my illness it had occurred to me that when I
completely recovered, inasmuch as I was inwardly an ear-bored slave of
the K&#863;hw&#257;ja (Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n) and was indebted to
him for my existence, I should openly make holes in my ears and be
enrolled among his ear-marked slaves. On Thursday, 12th
S&#863;hahr&#299;war,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6077src" href=
"#xd24e6077" name="xd24e6077src">13</a> corresponding to the month of
Rajab, I made holes in my ears and drew into each a shining pearl. When
the servants of the palace and my loyal friends saw this, both those
who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>were in the presence and some who were in the
distant borders diligently and eagerly made holes in their ears, and
adorned the beauty of sincerity with pearls and rubies which were in
the private treasury, and were bestowed on them, until by degrees the
infection caught the Ahadis and others. At the end of the day of
Thursday, the 22nd of the said month, corresponding with the 10th
S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n, the meeting for my solar weighing was arranged
in my private audience hall, and the usual observances were carried
out. On the same day M&#299;rz&#257; R&#257;ja Bh&#257;o Singh,
gratified and prosperous, returned to his native country with the
promise that he would not delay (there) more than two or three months.
On the 27th of the month of Mihr news came that Far&#299;d&#363;n
K&#863;h&#257;n Barl&#257;s had died at Udaipur. In the clan of
Barl&#257;s no leader remained but he. As his tribe had many claims on
this State and endless connection with it, I patronised his son Mihr
&#703;Al&#299;, and raised him to the mansab of 1,000 personal and
horse. On account of the approved services of K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n, I increased by 1,000 his mansab, which became 6,000
personal and 5,000 horse, original and increase. On the 6th
&#256;b&#257;n the <i>qar&#257;wuls</i>
(<i>s&#863;hik&#257;r&#299;s</i>) reported that three tigers had been
met at a distance of 6 kos. Starting after midday, I killed all three
of them with a gun. On the 8th of the month the festival of the
Dew&#257;l&#299; came on. I ordered the attendants of the palace to
have games with each other for two or three nights in my presence;
winnings and losings took place. On the 8th of this month they brought
to Ajmir the body of Sikandar Mu&#703;&#299;n Qar&#257;wul
(S&#863;hik&#257;r&#299;), who was one of my old attendants and had
done much service for me when I was prince, from Udaipur, which was the
place where my son Sult&#804;&#257;n K&#863;hurram was staying. I
ordered the qarawuls and his fellow-tribesmen to take his body and bury
it on the bank of R&#257;n&#257; S&#863;hankar&rsquo;s tank. He was a
good servant to me. On the 12th &#256;z&#817;ar two daughters whom
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n in his lifetime had
taken from the Zamindar of K&#363;ch (Behar), whose country is on the
boundary of the eastern provinces, together with his son and 94
elephants, were brought before me. Some of the elephants were placed in
my private stud. On the same day, H&#363;s&#863;hang, Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s son, came from Bengal, and had the good fortune
to kiss the threshold, and presented as offerings two elephants, 100
muhrs, and 100 rupees. On one particular night in Day I dreamt that the
late king (Akbar) said to me: &ldquo;B&#257;b&#257;, forgive for my
sake the fault of &#703;Az&#299;z K&#863;h&#257;n, who is the
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am.&rdquo; After this dream, I decided to
summon him from the fort (of Gwalior).</p>
<p class="par">There is a ravine in the neighbourhood of Ajmir that is
very beautiful. At the end of this ravine a spring appears which is
collected in a long and broad tank, and is the best water in Ajmir.
This valley and spring are well known as H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804;
Jam&#257;l. When I crossed over to this place I ordered a suitable
building to be made there, as the place was good and fit for
developing. In the course of a year a house and grounds were made
there, the like of which those<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6092src"
href="#xd24e6092" name="xd24e6092src">14</a> who travel round the world
cannot point out. They made a basin 40 gaz by 40, and made the water of
the spring rise up in the basin by a fountain. The fountain leaps up 10
or 12 gaz. Buildings are laid on the edge of this basin, and in the
same way above, where the tank and fountain are, they have made
agreeable places and enchanting halls and resting-rooms pleasant to the
senses. These have been constructed and finished off in a masterly
style by skilled painters and clever artists. As I desired that it
should be called by a name <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href=
"#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>connected with my august name, I
gave it the name of Chas&#863;hma-i-N&#363;r, or &lsquo;the fountain of
light.&rsquo; In short, the one fault it has is this, that it ought to
have been in a large city, or at a place by which men frequently pass.
From the day on which it was completed I have often passed Thursdays
and Fridays there. I ordered that they should think out a chronogram
for its completion. Sa&#703;&#299;d&#257; G&#299;l&#257;n&#299;, the
head of the goldsmiths, discovered it in this clever
hemistich:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The palace<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6100src"
href="#xd24e6100" name="xd24e6100src">15</a> of S&#863;h&#257;h
N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rdquo; (1024).</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">I ordered them to put a stone with this carved
upon it on the top of the portico of the building.</p>
<p class="par">In the beginning of the month of Day, merchants came
from Persia and brought pomegranates of Yazd and melons from
K&#257;r&#299;z, which are the best of Khurasan melons, so many that
all the servants of the Court and the Amirs of the frontiers obtained a
portion of them and were very grateful to the True Giver (God) for
them. I had never had such melons and pomegranates. It seemed as if I
had never had a pomegranate or a melon before. Every year I had had
melons from Badakhshan and pomegranates from Kabul, but they bore no
comparison with the Yazd pomegranates and the K&#257;r&#299;z melons.
As my revered father (may God&rsquo;s light be his witness!) had a
great liking for fruit, I was very grieved that such fruits had not
come to Hindustan from Persia in his victorious time, that he might
have enjoyed and profited by them. I have the same regret for the
<i>Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; &#703;it&#804;r</i> (so-called otto of
roses), that his nostrils were not gratified with such essences. This
&#703;it&#804;r is a discovery which was made during my reign through
the efforts of the mother of N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam. When she was
making rose-water <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271"
name="pb271">271</a>]</span>a scum formed on the surface of the dishes
into which the hot rose-water was poured from the jugs. She collected
this scum little by little; when much rose-water was obtained a
sensible portion of the scum was collected. It is of such strength in
perfume that if one drop be rubbed on the palm of the hand it scents a
whole assembly, and it appears as if many red rosebuds had bloomed at
once. There is no other scent of equal excellence to it. It restores
hearts that have gone and brings back withered souls. In reward for
that invention I presented a string of pearls to the inventress.
Sal&#299;ma<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6112src" href="#xd24e6112" name=
"xd24e6112src">16</a> Sult&#804;&#257;n Begam (may the lights of God be
on her tomb) was present, and she gave this oil the name of
&lsquo;&#703;it&#804;r-i-Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299;.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Great difference appeared in the climates of India. In
this month of Day, in Lahore, which is between Persia and Hindustan,
the mulberry-tree bore fruit of as much sweetness and fine flavour as
in its ordinary season. For some days people were delighted by eating
it. The news-writers of that place wrote this. In the same days
Bak&#863;htar K&#863;h&#257;n Kal&#257;want, who was closely connected
with &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, inasmuch as he (&#703;&#256;dil)
married his own brother&rsquo;s daughter to him, and made him his
preceptor in singing and <i>durpat</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6119src" href="#xd24e6119" name="xd24e6119src">17</a>
<i>guftan</i>, appeared in the habit of a dervish. Summoning him and
enquiring into his circumstances, I endeavoured to honour him. In the
first assembly I gave him 10,000 rupees in cash and 50 pieces of cloth
of all sorts and a string of pearls, and having made him a guest of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, ordered him to enquire into his
circumstances. It did not appear whether he had come without
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s permission, or the latter
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>had sent him in this guise in order that he
might find out the designs of this Court and bring him news about them.
Considering his relationship to &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, it is
most probable that he has not come without &#703;&#256;dil
K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s knowledge. A report by M&#299;r
Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain, who at this time was (our)
ambassador at Bijapur, corroborates this idea, for he writes that
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n has, on account of the kindness which
has been shown by H.M. (Jah&#257;ng&#299;r) to Bak&#863;htar
K&#863;h&#257;n, been very gracious to him (Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n).
Every day he has shown him more and more favour, keeps him beside him
at nights, and recites to him durpats, which he (&#703;&#256;dil
K&#863;h&#257;n) has composed, and which he calls
<i>nauras</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e6138src" href="#xd24e6138"
name="xd24e6138src">18</a> (Juvenilia). &ldquo;The remainder of the
facts will be written on the day when I get my dismissal.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In these days they brought a bird from the country of
Z&#299;rb&#257;d (Sumatra, etc., Blochmann, p. 616) which was coloured
like a parrot, but had a smaller body. One of its peculiarities is that
it lays hold with its feet of the branch or perch on which they may
have placed it and then makes a somersault, and remains in this
position all night and whispers to itself. When day comes it seats
itself on the top of the branch. Though they say that animals also have
worship, yet it is most likely that this practice is instinctive. It
never drinks water, and water acts like poison upon it, though other
birds subsist on water.</p>
<p class="par">In the month<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6148src" href=
"#xd24e6148" name="xd24e6148src">19</a> of Bahman there came pieces of
good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>news one after the other. The first was that the
R&#257;n&#257; Amar Singh had elected for obedience and service to the
Court. The circumstances of this affair are these. My son of lofty
fortune, Sult&#804;&#257;n K&#863;hurram, by dint of placing a great
many posts, especially in some places where most people said it was
impossible to place them on account of the badness of the air and water
and the wild nature of the localities, and by dint of moving the royal
forces one after another in pursuit, without regard to the heat or
excessive rain, and making prisoners of the families of the inhabitants
of that region, brought matters with the R&#257;n&#257; to such a pass
that it became clear to him that if this should happen to him again he
must either fly the country or be made prisoner. Being without remedy,
he chose obedience and loyalty, and sent to my fortunate son his
maternal uncle, Subh Karan, with Harid&#257;s Jh&#257;l&#257;, who was
one of the men in his confidence, and petitioned that if that fortunate
son would ask forgiveness for his offences and tranquillise his mind,
and obtain for him the auspicious sign-manual,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6153src" href="#xd24e6153" name="xd24e6153src">20</a> he would
himself come and wait on my son, and would send his son and successor
Karan to Court, or he, after the manner of other Rajas, would be
enrolled amongst the servants of the Court and do service. He also
begged that he himself might be excused from coming to Court on account
of his old age. Accordingly my son sent them in company with his own
Diwan Mull&#257; S&#863;hukru-llah, whom after the conclusion of this
business I dignified with the title of Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n, and
Sundar D&#257;s, his major-domo, who, after this matter was settled,
was honoured with the title of R&#257;y R&#257;y&#257;n, to the exalted
Court, and represented the circumstances. My lofty <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>mind
was always desirous, as far as possible, not to destroy the old
families. The real point was that as R&#257;n&#257; Amar Singh and his
fathers, proud in the strength of their hilly country and their abodes,
had never seen or obeyed any of the kings of Hindustan, this should be
brought about in my reign. At the request of my son I forgave the
R&#257;n&#257;&rsquo;s offences, and gave a gracious farman that should
satisfy him, and impressed on it the mark of my auspicious
palm.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6164src" href="#xd24e6164" name=
"xd24e6164src">21</a> I also wrote a farman of kindness to my son that
if he could arrange to settle the matter I should be much pleased. My
son also sent them<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6170src" href=
"#xd24e6170" name="xd24e6170src">22</a> with Mull&#257;
S&#863;hukru-llah and Sundar D&#257;s to the R&#257;n&#257; to console
him and make him hopeful of the royal favour. They gave him the
gracious farman with the sign-manual of the auspicious hand, and it was
settled that on Sunday, the 26th of the month of Bahman, he and his
sons should come and pay their respects to my son. The second piece of
good news was the death of Bah&#257;dur, who was descended from the
rulers of Gujarat, and was the leaven of disturbance and mischief
(there). Almighty God had annihilated him in His mercy: he died of a
natural illness. The third piece of news was the defeat of the
Warz&#257; (Portuguese Viceroy), who had done his best to take the
castle and port of Surat. In the roadstead<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6176src" href="#xd24e6176" name="xd24e6176src">23</a> of the port
of Surat a fight took place between the English, who had taken shelter
there, and the Viceroy. Most of his ships were burnt by the English
fire. Being helpless he had not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275"
href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>the power to fight any more,
and took to flight. He sent some one to Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n, who
was the governor of the ports of Gujarat, and knocked at the door of
peace, and said that he had come to make peace and not to make war. It
was the English who had stirred up the war. Another piece of news was
that some of the Rajputs, who had determined to attack and kill
&#703;Ambar (misprinted G&#863;h&#299;r), had made an ambush, and
finding a good opportunity had gained access to him, when a slight
wound had been inflicted on him by one of them. The men who were round
&#703;Ambar (again misprinted G&#863;h&#299;r) had killed the Rajputs
and taken &#703;Ambar to his quarters. A very little<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e6190src" href="#xd24e6190" name="xd24e6190src">24</a> more
would have made an end of him. In the end of this month, when I was
employed in hunting in the environs of Ajmir, Muh&#803;ammad
Beg,<a class="noteref" id="n275.2src" href="#n275.2" name=
"n275.2src">25</a> an attendant on my fortunate son Sult&#804;&#257;n
K&#863;hurram, came and brought a report from that son, and stated that
the R&#257;n&#257; had come with his sons and paid his respects to the
prince; &ldquo;the details would be made known by the report.&rdquo; I
immediately turned the face of supplication to the Divine Court, and
prostrated myself in thanksgiving. I presented a horse, an elephant,
and a jewelled dagger to the aforesaid Muh&#803;ammad Beg, and honoured
him with the title of Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n275.2">25</a> From the
report it appeared that on Sunday, the 26th Bahman, the R&#257;n&#257;
paid his respects to my fortunate son with the politeness and ritual
that servants pay their respects, and produced as offerings a famous
large ruby that was in his house, with some decorated articles and
seven elephants, some of them fit for the private stud, and which had
not fallen into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276"
name="pb276">276</a>]</span>our hands and were the only ones left him,
and nine horses.</p>
<p class="par">My son also behaved to him with perfect kindness. When
the R&#257;n&#257; clasped his feet and asked forgiveness for his
faults, he took his head and placed it on his breast, and consoled him
in such a manner as to comfort him. He presented him with a superb
dress of honour, a jewelled sword, a horse with a jewelled saddle, and
a private elephant with silver housings, and, as there were not more
than 100 men with him who were worthy of complete robes of honour
(<i>sar u p&#257;</i>), he gave 100 sarupa and 50 horses and 12
jewelled <i>khapwa</i> (daggers). As it is the custom of the Zamindars
that the son who is the heir-apparent should not go with his father to
pay his respects to a king or prince, the R&#257;n&#257; observed this
custom, and did not bring with him Karan, the son who had received the
<i>&#7789;&#299;k&#257;</i>. As the hour (fixed by astrology) of the
departure of that son of lofty fortune from that place was the end of
that same day, he gave him leave, so that, having himself gone, he
might send Karan to pay his respects. After he had gone, Karan also
came and did so. To him also he gave a superb dress of honour, a
jewelled sword and dagger, a horse with a gold saddle, and a special
elephant, and on the same day, taking Karan in attendance, he proceeded
towards the illustrious Court. On the 3rd Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817; my
return to Ajmir from hunting took place. From the 17th Bahman up to
that date, during which I was hunting, one tigress with three cubs and
thirteen nilgaw had been killed. The fortunate prince encamped on
Saturday, the 10th of the same month, at the village of
Devr&#257;n&#299;, which is near the city of Ajmir, and an order was
given that all the Amirs should go to meet him, and that each should
present an offering according to his standing and condition, and on the
next day, Sunday, the 11th he should have the good fortune to wait upon
me. The next <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>day the prince, with great magnificence, with
all the victorious forces that had been appointed to accompany him on
that service, entered the public palace. The hour for him to wait on me
was when two watches and two gharis of the day had passed, and he had
the good fortune to pay his respects, and performed his prostrations
and salutations. He presented 1,000 ashrafis and 1,000 rupees by way of
offering, 1,000 muhrs and 1,000 rupees by way of charity. I called that
son forward and embraced him, and having kissed his head and face,
favoured him with special kindnesses and greetings. When he had
finished the dues of service and had presented his offerings and
charities, he petitioned that Karan might be exalted with the good
fortune of prostrating himself and paying his respects. I ordered them
to bring him, and the Bakhshis with the usual ceremonies of respect
produced him. After prostration and salutation were completed, at the
request of my son K&#863;hurram, I ordered them to place him in front
on the right hand of the circle. After this I ordered K&#863;hurram to
go and wait on his mothers, and gave him a special dress of honour,
consisting of a jewelled <i>ch&#257;rqab</i> (sleeveless vest), a coat
of gold brocade, and a rosary of pearls. After he had made his
salutation, there were presented to him a special dress of honour, a
special horse with a jewelled saddle, and a special elephant. I also
honoured Karan with a superb robe of honour and a jewelled sword, and
the Amirs and mansabdars had the honour of prostrating themselves and
paying their respects, and presented their offerings. Each of these,
according to his service and rank, was honoured with favours. As it was
necessary to win the heart of Karan, who was of a wild nature and had
never seen assemblies and had lived among the hills, I every day showed
him some fresh favour, so that on the second day of his attendance a
jewelled dagger, and on the next day a special Iraqi horse with
jewelled saddle, were given <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href=
"#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>to him. On the day when he went to
the darbar in the female apartments, there were given to him on the
part of N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam a rich dress of honour, a jewelled
sword, a horse and saddle, and an elephant. After this I presented him
with a rosary of pearls of great value. On the next day a special
elephant with trappings (<i>tal&#257;yir</i>) were given. As it was in
my mind to give him something of every kind, I presented him with three
hawks and three falcons, a special sword, a coat of mail, a special
cuirass, and two rings, one with a ruby and one with an emerald. At the
end of the month I ordered that all sorts of cloth stuffs, with carpets
and cushions (named <i>takiya</i>) and all kinds of perfumes, with
vessels of gold, two Gujrati carts, and cloths, should be placed in a
hundred trays. The Ahadis carried them in their arms and on their
shoulders to the public audience hall, where they were bestowed on
him.</p>
<p class="par">S&#804;&#257;bit K&#863;h&#257;n<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6230src" href="#xd24e6230" name="xd24e6230src">26</a> at the
paradise-resembling assemblies was always addressing unbecoming
speeches and making palpable allusions to I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah
and his son &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n. Once or twice, showing my
dislike of this, I had forbidden him to do so, but this was not enough
for him. As I held very dear I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah&rsquo;s
good-will towards me, and was very closely connected with his family,
this matter became very irksome to me. As one night without reason and
without motive he began to speak unpleasant words to him, and said them
to such an extent that signs of vexation and annoyance became evident
in I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah&rsquo;s face, I sent him next morning,
in the custody of a servant of the Court, to &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n to say that as on the previous evening he had spoken
unpleasant words to his father I handed him over to him, and he might
shut him up either there or in the fort of Gwalior, as he pleased;
until he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=

his fault. According to the order &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n sent
him to Gwalior fort. In the same month Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n was promoted to an increased mansab, and was given that
of 2,500 personal and 2,000 horse. Ah&#803;mad Beg K&#863;h&#257;n, who
is one of the old retainers of the State, committed some faults on the
journey to the Subah of Kabul, and Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, who was
the commander of the army, had repeatedly complained of his making
himself disagreeable. Necessarily I summoned him to Court, and in order
to punish him handed him over to Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n to
confine him in the fort of Ran&#7789;ambhor. Q&#257;sim
K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of Bengal, had sent two rubies as an
offering, and they were laid before me. As I had made a rule that they
should bring before me after two watches of the night had passed the
dervishes and necessitous people who had collected in the illustrious
palace, this year also after the same manner I bestowed on the
dervishes with my own hand and in my own presence 55,000 rupees and
190,000 bighas of land, with fourteen entire villages, and twenty-six
ploughs,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6235src" href="#xd24e6235" name=

According to the Ma&#702;&#257;s&#804;ir, iii, 486, in the biography of
&#703;&#298;s&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, Rustam was sent to put down the
Tark&#863;h&#257;ns, and succeeded in doing so. See also ibid., p. 438,
in the biography of Rustam, where it is said that Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
told him to send away the Arghuns. Perhaps the passage in
Ma&#702;&#257;s&#804;ir, p. 438, which according to Blochmann, p. 314,
means that Rustam ill-treated the Arghuns, rather means that he
intrigued with them but oppressed the peasantry.&nbsp;<a class=

<p class="par first">When 55 seconds had passed on Saturday, 1st
Farward&#299;n, in my 10th year, corresponding with the 8th<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6259src" href="#xd24e6259" name="xd24e6259src">1</a>
of the month of &#7778;afar (March, 1615), 1024 Hijra, the sun from the
constellation of Pisces entered the house of honour of Aries. When
three gharis had passed on the night of Sunday I seated myself on the
throne of State. The New Year&rsquo;s feast and ceremonials were
prepared in the usual manner. The illustrious princes, the great
K&#863;h&#257;ns, the chief officers and Ministers of State made their
salutations of congratulation. On the 1st of the month the mansab of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah was increased from 5,000 personal and 2,000
horse by 1,000 personal and horse. Special horses were given to the
Kunwar Karan, Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, and
R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo. On the 2nd the offering of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n was laid before me; it was an approved
offering of jewels and jewelled ornaments and things of gold, of cloth
stuffs of all kinds and descriptions and was looked over in detail.
That which I approved was worth 85,000 rupees. On this day a jewelled
sword with a belt and band(?) (<i>band u b&#257;r</i>) was given to
Karan, and an elephant to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n.
As I had made up my mind to proceed to the Deccan, I gave an order to
&#703;Abdu-l-Kar&#299;m Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299;, to go to Mandu and
prepare a new building for my private residence and repair the
buildings of the old kings. On the 3rd day the offerings of R&#257;ja
B&#299;r Singh Deo were laid before me and one ruby, some pearls, and
one elephant had the honour of being accepted. On the 4th day the
mansab of Mustaf&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n was increased by 500 personal
and 200 horse to 2,000 personal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281"
href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>and 250 horse. On the 5th I
gave a standard and drums to I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, and an order
was given him to beat his drums. The mansab of &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n was increased by 1,000 personal and horse to 4,000
personal and 2,000 horse, and having increased the mansab of R&#257;ja
B&#299;r Singh Deo by 700 horse, I dismissed him to his own country,
directing that he should present himself at Court at stated periods. On
the same day the offering of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n was laid
before me. Some of all the kinds of things pleased me. Kishan Chand, of
the sons of the Rajas of Nagarkot, was honoured with the title of Raja.
On Thursday, the 6th, the offerings of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah were
laid before me at Chas&#863;hma-i-N&#363;r; a large meeting had been
arranged, and by way of favour the whole of his offerings were
inspected. Of the jewels and jewelled things and choice cloth stuffs
the value of 100,000 rupees was accepted, and the remainder given back.
On the 7th day I increased by 1,000 personal the mansab of Kishan
Singh, which had been 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse. On this day a
tiger was killed in the neighbourhood of Chas&#863;hma-i-N&#363;r. On
the 8th I gave Karan the mansab of 5,000 personal and horse, and gave
him a small rosary of pearls and emeralds with a ruby in the centre
which in the language of the Hindus is called <i>smaran</i> (Sanskrit
for &lsquo;remembrance&rsquo;). I increased the mansab of
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n by 1,000 personal and 400 horse, so
as to make it 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, original and increase.
The mansab of H&#803;&#257;j&#299; B&#299; &#362;zbeg was increased by
300 horse, and that of R&#257;ja S&#863;hy&#257;m Singh by 500 personal
so as to make it 2,500 personal and 1,400 horse. On Sunday, the 9th,
there was an eclipse of the sun when twelve gharis of the day had
passed. It began from the west, and four out of five parts of the sun
were eclipsed in the knot of the dragon. From the commencement of the
seizure until it became light eight gharis elapsed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>Alms
of all kinds, and things in the shape of metals, animals, and
vegetables, were given to fakirs and the poor and people in need. On
this day the offering of R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh was laid before me;
what was taken was of the value of 43,000 rupees. The offering of
Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n, the governor of Qandahar, was also laid
before me on this day; its total value came to 14,000 rupees. Two
watches of the night had passed on the night of Monday, the 29th
&#7778;afar (30th March, 1615), in the ascension of Sagittarius, when a
boy was born to B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram by the daughter of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n; I gave him the name of D&#257;r&#257;
S&#863;huk&#363;h. I hope that his coming will be propitious to this
State conjoined with eternity, and to his fortunate father. The mansab
of Sayyid &#703;Al&#299; B&#257;rha was increased by 500 personal and
300 horse, so as to bring it to 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. On the
10th the offering of I&#703;tib&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n was laid before
me, and what was of the value of 40,000 rupees was accepted. On this
day the mansab of K&#863;husrau B&#299; &#362;zbeg was raised by 300
horse, and that of Mangl&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n by 500 personal and 200
horse. On the 11th the offering of Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n
was laid before me. Of it seven rubies, one rosary of pearls, and 270
other pearls were accepted, and their value was 145,000 rupees. On the
12th the offerings of M&#299;rz&#257; R&#257;ja Bh&#257;o Singh and
R&#257;wat S&#863;hankar were laid before me. On the 13th, out of the
offering of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan, one
<i>qutb&#299;</i> (Egyptian?) ruby, one diamond, one string of pearls,
five rings, four pearls, and some cloths, altogether the value of
32,000 rupees, were accepted. On the 14th the mansab of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan, which was 3,000 personal and
700 horse, was increased by 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and that of
Waf&#257;d&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, of 750 personal and 200 horse, by
2,000 personal and 1,200 horse. On the same day Mustaf&#257; Beg, the
ambassador of the ruler of Iran, had the good fortune to wait upon me.
After <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>completing the matter of Gurjistan (Georgia), my
exalted brother sent him with a letter consisting of expressions of
friendship and assurances of sincerity, with several horses, camels,
and some stuffs from Aleppo, which had come for that fortunate brother
from the direction of R&#363;m. Nine large European hunting dogs, for
which a request had gone, were also sent by him.</p>
<p class="par">Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, on this day,
obtained leave to go for the capture of the fort of K&#257;ngra, the
equal of which for strength they cannot point to in the hill country of
the Panjab or even all the habitable world. From the time when the
sound of Islam reached the country of Hindustan up to this auspicious
time when the throne of rule has been adorned by this suppliant at the
throne of Allah, none of the rulers or kings has obtained possession of
it. Once in the time of my revered father, the army of the Panjab was
sent against this fort, and besieged it for a long time. At length they
came to the conclusion that the fort was not to be taken, and the army
was sent off to some more necessary business. When he was dismissed, I
gave Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n a private elephant with
trappings. R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Mal, son of R&#257;ja B&#257;so, as his
country was near that fort, was also appointed, and his previous mansab
was increased by 500 personal and horse. R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh
also came from his place and jagir and waited on me, and presented an
offering of 100 ashrafis. On the 17th the offering of M&#299;rz&#257;
Rustam was laid before me. Two jewelled daggers, one rosary of pearls,
some pieces of cloth, an elephant, and four Iraq horses were accepted,
and the rest returned; their value was 15,000 rupees. On the same date
the offering of I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n, of the value of
18,000 rupees, was laid before me. On the 18th the offering of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n was inspected. Of jewels
and cloth stuffs the value of 15,000 rupees was accepted. The mansab of
I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n, which was 700 personal and 200
horse, I increased <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284"
name="pb284">284</a>]</span>by 800 personal and 300 horse, so that with
original and increase it came to 1,500 personal and 500 horse.
K&#863;husrau B&#299; &#362;zbeg, who was one of the distinguished
soldiers, died of the disease of dysentery. On the 8th day, which was
Thursday, after two watches and four and a half gharis had passed, the
<i>s&#863;haraf</i> (highest point of the sun&rsquo;s ascension) began.
On this auspicious day I ascended the throne in happiness and
prosperity, and the people saluted and congratulated me. When one watch
of the day remained I went to the Chas&#863;hma-i-N&#363;r. According
to agreement the offering of Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n was laid
before me at that place. He had arranged beautiful jewels and
jewellery, with cloth stuff and articles of all kinds that were
pleasing to me. Among these, a jewelled khapwa (dagger), which at his
request the royal artificers had made, and the like of which in value
there did not exist in my private treasury, was worth 100,000 rupees.
In addition to this, jewels and other things of the value of 138,000
rupees were taken. Indeed, it was a splendid offering. To
Mu&#7779;t&#804;af&#257; Beg, the ambassador of the ruler of Iran, I
gave 20,000 <i>darab</i>, or 10,000 rupees. On the 21st I sent robes of
honour by the hand of &#703;Abdu-l-G&#863;haf&#363;r to fifteen of the
Amirs of the Deccan. R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t obtained leave to
go to his jagir, and a special shawl (<i>parm narm</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6302src" href="#xd24e6302" name=
"xd24e6302src">2</a>) was given to him. On the same day I gave a
jewelled waist-dagger to Mu&#7779;t&#804;af&#257; Beg, the ambassador.
I increased the mansab of H&#363;shang, the son of Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, which was 1,000 personal and 500 horse, by 500
personal and 200 horse. On the 23rd, Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n
was promoted to the Subah of Behar. Zafar K&#863;h&#257;n was ordered
to present himself at Court. To the mansab of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, which was 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, I added 500
personal and 1,000 horse. Saif K&#863;h&#257;n on the same day was
dismissed to his jagir, as well as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285"
href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>H&#803;&#257;j&#299; B&#299;
&#362;zbeg, who was honoured with the title of &#362;zbeg
K&#863;h&#257;n. Bah&#257;duru-l-mulk, who belonged to the army of the
Deccan and held the mansab of 2,500 personal and 2,100 horse received
an increase of 500 personal and 200 horse. An increase of 200 was made
in the mansab of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Taq&#299;, which was 800 personal
and 180 horse. On the 25th an increase of 200 horse was made in the
rank of Sal&#257;mu-llah, the Arab, so that it became 1,500 personal
and 1,000 horse. I presented Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n with the
black piebald horse out of my special horses which the ruler of Iran
had sent me. At the end of the day of Thursday I went to the house of
B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram and remained there till a watch of the
night had passed. His second offering was laid before me on that day.
On the first day he paid his respects he laid before me a celebrated
ruby of the R&#257;n&#257;, which, on the day of his paying his
respects, he had made an offering of to my son, and which the jewellers
valued at 60,000 rupees. It was not worthy of the praise they had given
it. The weight of this ruby was eight <i>t&#257;nk</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6314src" href="#xd24e6314" name="xd24e6314src">3</a>
and it was formerly in the possession of R&#257;y Maldeo, who was the
chief of the tribe of the R&#257;&#7789;hors and one of the chief
rulers (or Rays) of Hindustan. From him it was transferred to his son
Chandar Sen, who, in the days of his wretchedness and hopelessness,
sold it to R&#257;n&#257; &#362;day Singh. From him it went to
R&#257;n&#257; Part&#257;p, and afterwards to this R&#257;n&#257; Amar
Singh. As they had no more valuable gift in their family, he presented
it on the day that he paid his respects to my fortunate son
B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram, together with the whole of his stud of
elephants, which, according to the Indian idiom, they call <i>gheta
ch&#257;r.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e6319src" href="#xd24e6319"
name="xd24e6319src">4</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href=
"#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>I ordered them to engrave on the
ruby that at the time of paying his respects R&#257;n&#257; Amar Singh
had presented it as an offering to Sult&#257;n K&#863;hurram. On that
day certain other things from among the offerings of B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram were accepted. Among them was a little crystal box of
Frank work, made with great taste, with some emeralds, three rings,
four Iraq horses, and various other things, the value of which was
80,000 rupees. On the day on which I went to his house he had prepared
a great offering, in fact there were laid before me things and rarities
worth about four or five lakhs of rupees. Of these the equivalent of
100,000 rupees was taken away and the balance given to him.</p>
<p class="par">On the 28th the mansab of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n,
which was 3,000 personal and 1,800 horse, was increased by 500 personal
and 400 horse. In the end of the month I presented Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
K&#863;h&#257;n with a horse, a robe of honour, a jewelled dagger, a
standard and drums, and dismissed him to the province of Behar. The
office of <i>&#703;arz&#803;-mukarrir</i> (reviser of petitions), that
belonged to K&#863;hw&#257;jag&#299; H&#803;&#257;j&#299; Muhammad, as
he had died, I gave to Muk&#863;hli&#7779; K&#863;h&#257;n, who was in
my confidence. Three hundred horse were increased in the mansab of
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n, who now had 1,000 personal and horse. As
the hour of the leave-taking of Kunwar Karan was at hand, I was
desirous of showing him my skill in shooting with a gun. Just at this
time the <i>qar&#257;wul&#257;n</i> (shikaris) brought in news of a
tigress. Though it is an established custom of mine only to hunt male
tigers, yet, in consideration that no other tiger might be obtained
before his departure, I went for the tigress. I took with me Karan, and
said to him that I would hit it wherever he wished me to do so. After
this arrangement I went to the place where they had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>marked down the tiger. By chance there was a
wind and disturbance in the air, and the female elephant on which I was
mounted was terrified of the tigress and would not stand still.
Notwithstanding these two great obstacles to shooting, I shot straight
towards her eye. God Almighty did not allow me to be ashamed before
that prince, and, as I had agreed, I shot her in the eye. On the same
day Karan petitioned me for a special gun, and I gave him a special
Turkish one.</p>
<p class="par">As on the day for his departure I had not given
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n an elephant, I now gave him a special
elephant, and I also sent an elephant to Bah&#257;duru-l-mulk and one
to Waf&#257;d&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 8th Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht
the assemblage for my lunar weighing was held, and I weighed myself
against silver and other things, distributing them amongst the
deserving and needy. Naw&#257;zis&#863;h K&#863;h&#257;n took leave to
go to his jagir, which was in Malwa. On the same day I gave an elephant
to K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan. On the 9th they brought
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, who had come to Agra from the fort of
Gwalior, and who had been sent for. Though he had been guilty of many
offences, and in all that I had done to him I was right, yet when they
brought him into my presence and my eye fell on him, I perceived more
shame in myself than in him. Having pardoned all his offences, I gave
him the shawl I had round my waist. I gave Kunwar Karan 100,000
<i>darab</i>. On the same day R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh brought a
large elephant of the name of Ran-r&#257;wat, which was a celebrated
elephant of his, as an offering. In fact, it was such a rare elephant
that I put it into my private stud. On the 10th the offering of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, which he sent me from Agra by the hand of
his son, was laid before me. It was of all kinds of things, of the
value of 40,000 rupees. On the 12th the offering of K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n, which consisted of forty-five<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6369src" href="#xd24e6369" name="xd24e6369src">5</a> horse
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>two strings of camels, Arabian dogs
(greyhounds), and hunting animals (hawks?), was brought before me. On
the same day seven other elephants from R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh were
also brought to me as an offering, and were placed in my private stud.
Tah&#803;ayyur K&#863;h&#257;n, after he had been in attendance on me
for four months, to-day got leave to go. A message was sent to
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n. I impressed on him the profit and loss
of friendship and enmity, and made an agreement (with Tah&#803;ayyur
K&#863;h&#257;n) that all these words should be repeated to
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, and he should bring him back to the
path of loyalty and obedience. At the time of his taking leave I also
bestowed on him certain things. On the whole, in this short time, what
with the gifts bestowed on him by me privately, by the princes, and
those given him by the Amirs according to order, the account mounted up
to about 100,000 rupees that he had received. On the 14th the rank and
reward of my son K&#863;hurram were fixed. His mansab had been one of
12,000 personal and 6,000 horse, and that of his brother (Parw&#299;z)
15,000 personal and 8,000 horse. I ordered his mansab to be made equal
with that of Parw&#299;z, besides other rewards. I gave him a private
elephant of the name of Panch&#299; Gaj,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6382src" href="#xd24e6382" name="xd24e6382src">6</a> with
accoutrements of the value of 12,000 rupees. On the 16th an elephant
was given to Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 17th the mansab of
R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh, which was 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse,
was increased by 1,000, and it was raised to 5,000. At the request of
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n the mansab of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
&#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f, which was 500 personal and 200 horse,
was raised by 200, and it was ordered to be 1,000 personal and 400
horse. &#703;Abdu-llah, the son of K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am,
who was imprisoned in the fort of Ran&#7789;ambhor, was sent for at the
request of his father. He came to the Court, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>I
took the chains off his legs and sent him to his father&rsquo;s house.
On the 24th, R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh presented me with another
elephant, called Fauj-sang&#257;r (&lsquo;ornament of the army&rsquo;),
by way of offering. Although this is also a good elephant, and has been
placed in my private stud, it is not to be compared with the first
elephant (he sent), which is one of the wonders of the age, and is
worth 20,000 rupees. On the 26th, 200 personal were added to the mansab
of Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, son of M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h; it was 700 personal and 500 horse. On the
same day K&#863;hw&#257;ja Zainu-d-d&#299;n, who is of the
Naqs&#863;hband&#299; K&#863;hw&#257;jas, came from
M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr and waited on me, bringing as an
offering eighteen horses. Qizilb&#257;s&#863;h K&#863;h&#257;n, who was
one of the auxiliaries of the province of Gujarat, had come to Court
without the leave of the governor. I ordered that an ahadi should put
him into confinement, and that he be sent back to the governor of
Gujarat, so that others might not desire to do the same. The mansab of
Mub&#257;rak K&#863;h&#257;n Saz&#257;wal I raised 500 personal, so
that it should be 1,500 personal and 700 horse. On the 29th I gave
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am 100,000 rupees, and ordered that the
parganahs of D&#257;sna<a class="noteref" id="n300.1src" href="#n300.1"
name="n300.1src">7</a> and K&#257;sna,<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n300.1">7</a> which are equivalent to 5,000 personal, should be made
his jagir. At the end of the same month I gave leave to
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, with his brothers and
other relatives, to go to Allahabad, which had been appropriated to
them as jagir. At this meeting twenty horse, a <i>qab&#257;</i>
(<i>parm narm</i>) of Cashmere cloth, twelve deer, and ten Arabian dogs
were given to Karan. The next day, which was the 1st
K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d, forty horse, the next day forty-one horse, and
the third day twenty, amounting in the space of three days to 101 head,
were given as a present to Kunwar Karan. In return for the elephant
Fauj-sang&#257;r, an elephant worth 10,000 rupees out of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>my
private stud was presented to R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh. On the 5th of
the month ten turbans (<i>ch&#299;ra</i>), ten coats (<i>qaba</i>), and
ten waist-bands were given to Karan. On the 20th I gave him another
elephant.</p>
<p class="par">In these days the news-writer of Kashmir had written
that a Mull&#257; of the name of Gad&#257;&#702;&#299;, a disciplined
dervish, who for forty years had lived in one of the monasteries of the
city, had prayed the inheritors of that monastery two years<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6414src" href="#xd24e6414" name="xd24e6414src">8</a>
before he was to deliver over the pledge of his life that he might
select a corner in that monastery as a place for his burial. They said,
&ldquo;Let it be so.&rdquo; In short, he selected a place. When the
time for his delivery came he informed his friends and relations and
those who were dear to him that an order had reached him that,
delivering over the pledge (of life) he had, he should turn towards the
last world. Those who were present wondered at his words, and said that
the prophets had no such information, and how could they believe such
words? He said, &ldquo;Such an order has been given to me.&rdquo; He
then turned to one of his confidants, who was of the sons of the
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299;s of the country, and said: &ldquo;You will expend
the price<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6417src" href="#xd24e6417" name=
"xd24e6417src">9</a> of my Koran, which is worth 700 tankas, in
carrying me (to the grave). When you hear the call to Friday&rsquo;s
prayer you will enquire for me.&rdquo; This conversation took place on
the Thursday, and he divided all the goods in his room among his
acquaintance and disciples, and went, and at end of the day bathed at
the baths. The Q&#257;z&#803;&#299;-z&#257;da aforesaid came before the
call for prayer, and enquired as to the health of the Mull&#257;. When
he came to the door of the cell <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291"
href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>he found the door closed and
a servant sitting there. He asked the slave what had happened, and the
servant said, &ldquo;The Mull&#257; has enjoined me that until the door
of the cell open of its own accord I must not go in.&rdquo; Shortly
after these words were said the door of the cell opened. The
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299;-z&#257;da entered the cell with that servant and
saw that the Mull&#257; was on his knees with his face turned toward
the qibla, and had given up his soul to God. Happy the state of the
freed who can fly away from this place of the snares of dependence with
such ease!</p>
<p class="par">By the increase of 200 personal and 50 horse in the
mansab of Karam Sen R&#257;&#7789;hor, I raised it to 1,000 personal
and 300 horse. On the 11th of this month the offering of Las&#863;hkar
K&#863;h&#257;n, which consisted of three strings of Persian camels and
twenty cups and plates from K&#863;hit&#804;&#257; (China) and twenty
Arabian dogs, was brought before me. On the 12th a jewelled dagger was
bestowed on I&#703;tib&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, and to Karan I gave a
plume (<i>kalg&#299;</i>) worth 2,000 rupees. On the 14th I gave a
dress of honour to Sar-<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6427src" href=
"#xd24e6427" name="xd24e6427src">10</a>buland R&#257;y, and gave him
leave to go to the Deccan.</p>
<p class="par">On the night of Friday, the 15th, a strange affair
occurred. By chance on that night I was at Pushkar. To be brief,
Kis&#863;han, own brother to R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh, was in great
perturbation through Gobind D&#257;s, the Vakil of the said Raja having
some time ago killed his nephew, a youth of the name of Gop&#257;l
D&#257;s. The cause of the quarrel it would take too long to tell.
Kis&#863;han Singh expected that, as Gop&#257;l D&#257;s was also the
nephew of the Raja (S&#363;raj Singh), the latter would kill Gobind
D&#257;s. But the Raja, on account of the experience and ability of
Gobind D&#257;s, relinquished the idea of seeking revenge for his
nephew&rsquo;s death. When Kis&#863;han saw this neglect on the part of
the Raja, he resolved himself to take <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb292" href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>revenge for his
nephew, and not allow his blood to pass away unnoticed. For a long time
he kept this matter in his mind, until on that night he assembled his
brothers, friends, and servants, and told them that he would go that
night to take Gobind D&#257;s&rsquo;s life, whatever might happen, and
that he did not care what injury might happen to the Raja. The Raja was
in ignorance of what was happening, and when it was near dawn
Kis&#863;han came with Karan, his brother&rsquo;s son, and other
companions. When he arrived at the gate of the Raja&rsquo;s dwelling he
sent some of the experienced men on foot to the house of Gobind
D&#257;s, which was near the Raja&rsquo;s. He himself (Kis&#863;han)
was on horseback, and stationed himself near the gate. The men on foot
entered Gobind D&#257;s&rsquo;s house, and killed some of those who
were there on guard. Whilst this fight was going on Gobind D&#257;s
awoke, and seizing his sword in a state of bewilderment was coming out
from one side of the house to join the outside watchmen. When the men
on foot had finished killing some of the people, they came out of the
tent to endeavour to find out Gobind D&#257;s, and, meeting him, they
finished his affair (killed him). Before the news of the killing of
Gobind D&#257;s reached Kis&#863;han, he, unable to bear it any more,
dismounted and came inside the dwelling. Although his men protested in
a disturbed state that it was not right to be on foot, he would in no
way listen to them. If he had remained a little longer and the news of
his enemy having been killed had reached him, it is possible that he
would have escaped safe and sound, mounted as he was. As the pen of
destiny had gone forth after another fashion, as soon as he alighted
and went in, the Raja, who was in his <i>mah&#803;all</i> (female
apartment), awoke at the uproar among the people, and stood at the gate
of his house with his sword drawn. People from all sides were aroused
and came in against the men who were on foot. They saw what the number
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>of men on foot was, and came out in great
numbers and faced Kis&#863;han Singh&rsquo;s men, who were about ten in
number. In short, Kis&#863;han Singh and his nephew Karan, when they
reached the Raja&rsquo;s house, were attacked by these men and both of
them killed. Kis&#863;han Singh had seven and Karan nine wounds.
Altogether in this fight 66 men on the two sides were killed, on the
Raja&rsquo;s side 30 and on Kis&#863;han Singh&rsquo;s 36. When the sun
rose and illumined the world with its light, this business was
revealed, and the Raja saw that his brother, his nephew, and some of
his servants, whom he considered dearer than himself, were killed, and
the whole of the rest had dispersed to their own places. The news
reached me in Pushkar, and I ordered them to burn those who were
killed, according to their rites, and inform me of the true
circumstances of the affair. In the end it became clear that the affair
had happened in the manner in which it has been written here, and that
no further enquiry was necessary.</p>
<p class="par">On the 8th M&#299;r&#257;n &#7778;adr Jah&#257;n came
from his native place and waited on me with an offering of 100 muhrs.
R&#257;y S&#363;raj Singh was dismissed to his duty in the Deccan. I
presented him with a couple of pearls for his ears and a special
Kashmir shawl (<i>parm narm</i>). A pair of pearls were also sent to
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n. On the 25th I increased the mansab of
I&#703;tib&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n by 600 horse, so as to bring it to
5,000 personal and 2,000 horse. On the same day Karan obtained leave to
go to his jagir. He received a present of a horse, a special elephant,
a dress of honour, a string of pearls of the value of 50,000 rupees,
and a jewelled dagger which had been completed for 2,000 rupees. From
the time of his waiting on me till he obtained leave, what he had had
in the shape of cash, jewellery, jewels, and jewelled things was of the
value of 200,000 rupees, with 110 horses, five elephants, in addition
to what my son K&#863;hurram bestowed on him <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>at
various times. I gave Mub&#257;rak K&#863;h&#257;n Saz&#257;wal a horse
and an elephant, and appointed him to accompany him. I sent several
verbal messages to the R&#257;n&#257;. R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh also
obtained leave to go to his native country, with a promise to return in
two months. On the 27th, P&#257;yanda K&#863;h&#257;n
Mog&#863;hul,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6452src" href="#xd24e6452"
name="xd24e6452src">11</a> who was one of the old Amirs of the State,
gave up the deposit of his life.</p>
<p class="par">At the end of this month news came that the ruler of
Iran had executed his eldest son &#7778;af&#299; M&#299;rz&#257;. This
was a cause of great bewilderment. When I enquired into it they said
that at Daras&#863;h,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6457src" href=
"#xd24e6457" name="xd24e6457src">12</a> which is one of the noted
cities of G&#299;l&#257;n, he ordered a slave of the name of
Bihb&#363;d to kill &#7778;af&#299; M&#299;rz&#257;. The slave found an
opportunity, early in the morning on the 5th of Muh&#803;arram, in the
year 1024 (25th January, 1615), when the M&#299;rz&#257; was returning
from the baths towards his house, and finished his affair for him with
two wounds from a sword (<i>s&#299;k&#863;hak&#299;</i>).<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6463src" href="#xd24e6463" name=
"xd24e6463src">13</a> After a great part of the day had passed, while
his body lay between the water and the mud, S&#863;haik&#863;h
Bah&#257;&#702;u-d-d&#299;n Muh&#803;ammad, who was the best known man
in the country for learning and holiness, and on whom the Shah had full
reliance, reported the affair, and, obtaining leave to lift him up,
took his corpse and sent it to Ardab&#299;l, where was the
burial-ground of his ancestors. Although much enquiry was made of
travellers from Iran, no one would say a word of this affair that
satisfied my mind with regard to it. The killing of a son must have
some powerful motive in order to do away with the disgrace of it.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=

<p class="par">On the 1st of the month of T&#299;r I gave an elephant
of the name of Ranj&#299;t with its trappings to M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam
and another to Sayyid Al&#299; B&#257;rha. M&#299;rak H&#803;usain, a
relation of K&#863;hw&#257;ja S&#863;hamsu-d-d&#299;n, was appointed
bakhshi and news-writer of the Subah of Behar, and took leave to go. I
gave K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f
Q&#363;s&#863;h-beg&#299; (the falconer) an elephant and a dress of
honour, and dismissed him to his jagir. On the 9th of the same month I
gave a jewelled sword to K&#863;h&#257;n Dauran, and a jewelled dagger
was sent for Allahd&#257;d, the son of Jal&#257;l&#257; the Afghan, who
had become loyal. On the 13th took place the meeting for the festival
of the <i>&#256;b-p&#257;s&#863;h&#257;n</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6474src" href="#xd24e6474" name="xd24e6474src">14</a> (rose-water
scattering), and the servants of the Court amused themselves with
sprinkling rose-water over each other. On the 17th, Am&#257;nat
K&#863;h&#257;n was appointed to the port of Cambay. As Muqarrab
K&#863;h&#257;n proposed to come to Court, the (charge of the)
aforesaid port was changed. On the same day I sent a jewelled
waist-dagger to my son Parw&#299;z. On the 18th the offering of
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n was laid before me. He had
prepared all kinds of jewellery and other things, jewels with jewelled
things, such as three rubies and 103 pearls, 100 rubies
(<i>y&#257;q&#363;t</i>), two jewelled daggers and an aigrette adorned
with rubies and pearls, a jewelled water-jar, a jewelled sword, a
quiver bound with velvet, and a diamond ring, altogether of the value
of about 100,000 rupees, in addition to jewels and jewelled things,
cloth from the Deccan and Carnatic, and all kinds of gilt and plain
things, with fifteen elephants and a horse whose mane reached the
ground. The offering of S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n (his
son) also, consisting of five elephants, 300 pieces of all kinds of
cloth, was brought before me. On the 8th I honoured H&#363;s&#863;hang
with the title of Ikr&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n. R&#363;z-afz&#363;n, who
was one of the princes of the Subah of Behar and who had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>been
from his youth one of the permanent servants of the Court, having been
honoured by admission into Islam, was made Raja of the province of his
father, R&#257;ja Sangr&#257;m.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6482src"
href="#xd24e6482" name="xd24e6482src">15</a> Though the latter had been
killed in opposing the leaders of the State, I gave him an elephant and
leave to go to his native place. An elephant was presented to
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 24th, Jagat Singh,
son of Kunwar Karan, who was in his 12th year, came and waited on me,
and presented petitions from his grandfather, the R&#257;n&#257; Amar
Singh, and from his father. The signs of nobility and high birth were
evident on his face. I pleased him with a dress of honour and kindness.
To the mansab of M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;&#298;s&#257; Tark&#863;h&#257;n
an addition of 200 personal was made, so that it attained to 1,200
personal and 300 horse. In the end of the month, having honoured
S&#863;haik&#863;h H&#803;usain Roh&#299;la with the title of
Mub&#257;riz K&#863;h&#257;n, I dismissed him to his jagir. Ten
thousand darabs (5,000 rupees) were given to the relations of
M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;harafu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain
K&#257;s&#863;hg&#863;har&#299;, who at this time had come and had the
honour of kissing the threshold. On the 5th Amurd&#257;d, to the mansab
of R&#257;ja Nathmal, which was 1,500 personal and 1,100 horse, an
addition of 500 personal and 100 horse was made. On the 7th,
Kes&#863;ho (D&#257;s) M&#257;r&#363;, who had a jagir in the Sarkar of
Orissa, and who had been sent for to Court on account of a
complaint<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6485src" href="#xd24e6485" name=
"xd24e6485src">16</a> against the governor of the Subah of that place,
came and paid his respects. He produced as an offering four elephants.
As I had a great desire to see my <i>farzand</i> (son) K&#863;h&#257;n
Jah&#257;n (Lod&#299;), and for the purpose of enquiring into important
matters connected with the Deccan, it was necessary for him to come at
once, I sent for him. On Tuesday, the 8th of the same <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=

offering 1,000 muhrs, 1,000 rupees, 4 rubies, 20 pearls, 1 emerald, and
a jewelled <i>ph&#363;l ka&#7789;&#257;ra</i>, the total value being
50,000 rupees. On the night of Sunday, as it was the anniversary of the
great K&#863;hw&#257;ja (Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n), I went to his
revered mausoleum, and remained there till midnight. The attendants and
Sufis exhibited ecstatic states, and I gave the fakirs and attendants
money with my own hand; altogether there were expended 6,000 rupees in
cash, 100 <i>s&#804;aub-kurta</i> (a robe down to the ankles), 70
rosaries of pearls,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6502src" href=

Singh, grandson of R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh, was honoured with the
title of Raja, and a standard and drums given him. On the 16th an Iraq
horse out of my private stable and another horse were presented to
Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 19th an elephant was given to
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am. On the 20th, 200 horse were added to

An increase of 200 personal and horse was made to the mansab of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;&#256;qil, which was 1,200 personal and 600

go to Amber, which was his ancient native place, and had given him a

corresponding with the <i>S&#863;hab-i-bar&#257;t</i> (consecrated to

round the &#256;n&#257; S&#257;gar tank and on its banks, and went
myself to look at them. The reflection of the lamps fell on the water
and had a wonderful appearance. I passed the most of that night with

restoration of the fort of Ahmadnagar and the royal territory which had
been taken out of the possession of the chiefs of the victorious State
through the rebellion of certain rebels, came and waited on me, and
obtained leave to go on this date; and, having received a dress of
honour, an elephant, and a horse, started off. As R&#257;ja R&#257;j
Singh Kachhw&#257;ha had died in the Deccan, I promoted his son
R&#257;m D&#257;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301"
name="pb301">301</a>]</span>to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 400
horse. On the 4th of &#256;b&#257;n, drums were given to Saif
K&#863;h&#257;n B&#257;rha and his mansab increased by 300 horse, so as
to bring it up to 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse. On the same date I
released R&#257;ja M&#257;n, who was in confinement in the fort of
Gwalior, on the security of Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, and,
confirming his mansab, sent him to the said K&#863;h&#257;n for duty at
the fort of K&#257;ngra. At the request of K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n,
an increase of 300 horse was ordered to the mansab of &#7778;&#257;diq
K&#863;h&#257;n, raising it to 1,000 personal and horse.
M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;&#298;s&#257; Tark&#863;h&#257;n came from the
province of Sambhal, which was his jagir, and waited on me, and offered
100 muhrs. On the 16th, R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh obtained leave to go
to his duty in the Deccan, and I increased his mansab by 300 horse, so
as to make it 5,000 personal and 3,300 horse; he received a dress of
honour and a horse, and started. On the 18th I confirmed the mansab of
M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;&#298;s&#257;, original and increase, at 1,500
personal and 800 horse, and gave him an elephant and a dress of honour,
and he took leave to go to the Deccan.</p>
<p class="par">On the same day the news of the death of the wretch
Ch&#299;n Qil&#299;j was received by a letter from Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n. After the death of Qil&#299;j
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of the old servants of this State, I had
made this inauspicious man an Am&#299;r, and shown him great favour,
and given him in jagir such a place as Jaunpur. I also sent his other
brothers and relations with him and made them his deputies. He had one
brother of the name of Lahor&#299;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6564src"
href="#xd24e6564" name="xd24e6564src">22</a> of a very wicked
disposition. It was reported to me that the servants of God (people)
were greatly oppressed by his conduct. I sent an ahadi to bring him
(Lahor&#299;) from Jaunpur. At the coming of the ahadi, suspicion
without any cause prevailed over Ch&#299;n Qil&#299;j, and it came into
his mind to run away, taking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href=
"#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>his misguided brother with him.
Leaving his mansab, his government, place, and jagir, money, property,
children, and people, he took a little money and gold and a few jewels
and went with a small body among the zamindars. This news arrived a few
days ago and caused great astonishment. In short, to whatever zamindar
he went he took money<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6569src" href=
"#xd24e6569" name="xd24e6569src">23</a> from him(?) and then let him
go(?), until news came that he had entered the country of
Johat.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6572src" href="#xd24e6572" name=
"xd24e6572src">24</a> When this news reached Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, he sent some of his men to take and bring
that thoughtless one. They took him as soon as they arrived, and were
intending to take him to Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n,
when he at that very moment went to hell. Some of those who had
accompanied him said that for some days previously he had contracted an
illness and it had killed him. But this was heard of him as well, that
he committed suicide, in order that they might not take him to
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n in this state. In any
case, they brought his body with his children and servants who were
with him to Allahabad. They made away with most of the money that he
had, and the zamindars took it from him. Alas, that salt (i.e. loyalty)
should not have brought such black-faced wretches to condign
punishment!</p>

his previous services, I promoted him to be Subadar of Kashmir, and
confirmed his mansab of 2,500 personal and 1,500 horse, honoured him

By the hand of Ihtim&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n I sent winter dresses of
honour to Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of Bengal, and the Amirs
that were attached to that province. On the 15th of the month there was
laid before me the offering of Maka&#702;&#299;, son of

<p class="par">On the 20th, M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n came and waited on
me. A summary of his circumstances and of his family is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>now
written. On the side of his father<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6653src"
href="#xd24e6653" name="xd24e6653src">29</a> he is the grandson of

M&#299;r&#257;n, son of S&#863;h&#257;h Ni&#703;matu-llah Wal&#299;.
During the reigns of the &#7778;afaw&#299; kings the family had
attained to great respect, so that S&#863;h&#257;h T&#804;ahm&#257;sp
gave his own sister J&#257;nish<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6656src"

S&#863;h&#257;h Ni&#703;matu-llah, and so on account of his being a
great Shaikh and of his being an instructor he was made a relative and
a son-in-law (of kings). On the side of his mother he was the
daughter&rsquo;s son of S&#863;h&#257;h Isma&#703;&#299;l
K&#863;h&#363;n&#299; (Isma&#703;&#299;l II, the Bloody). After the

G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n Muh&#803;ammad M&#299;r
M&#299;r&#257;n received great consideration, and the late
S&#863;h&#257;h (T&#804;ahm&#257;sp) gave to his eldest son in marriage
a daughter from the royal family. He gave the daughter of the
above-mentioned S&#863;h&#257;h Isma&#703;&#299;l to another son of
his, K&#863;hal&#299;lu-llah, to whom M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n was
born. The aforesaid M&#299;r K&#863;hal&#299;lu-llah, seven or eight
years before this, had come from Persia and waited on me at Lahore. As
he belonged to a high and saintly family, I was much interested in his
affairs, and gave him a mansab and a jagir, and honoured and cherished
him. After the seat of government was at Agra, in a short time he was
attacked by bilious<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6659src" href=
"#xd24e6659" name="xd24e6659src">31</a> diarrh&oelig;a from eating too
many mangoes, and in ten or twelve days gave up his soul to the
Creator. I was grieved at his going, and ordered what he had left in
cash and jewels to be sent to his children in Persia. Meanwhile
M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n, who was 22 years old, became a qalandar and
dervish, and came to me at Ajmir in a way that nobody on the road could
recognize him. I soothed all the troubles of his mind and the miseries
of his inward and outward condition, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

of 1,000 personal and 400 horse, and presented him with 30,000 darabs
in cash. He is now in waiting and attendance on me.</p>
<p class="par">On the 12th, Z&#804;afar K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been
removed from the Subah of Behar, came and waited on me, and made an
offering of 100 muhrs, as well as three elephants. On the 15th of Day I
increased the mansab of Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n, the Subahdar of
Bengal, by 1,000 personal and horse, so as to make it 4,000 personal
and horse. As the diwan and bakhshi of Bengal, H&#803;usain Beg and
T&#804;&#257;hir, had not done approved service, Muk&#863;hli&#7779;
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of the confidential servants of the Court,
was nominated to these duties. I conferred on him a mansab of 2,000
personal and 700 horse, and also gave him a standard. The duty of
<i>&#703;arz&#803;-mukarrir</i> (reviser of petitions) I ordered to be
given to Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 25th, Friday, the
weighing of my son K&#863;hurram took place. Up to the present year,
when he is 24 years old, and is married and has children, he has never
defiled himself with drinking wine. On this day, when the assembly for
his weighing was held, I said to him: &ldquo;B&#257;b&#257;, thou hast
become the father of children, and kings and kings&rsquo; sons have
drunk wine. To-day, which is the day of thy being weighed, I will give
thee wine to drink, and give thee leave to drink it on feast days and
at the time of the New Year, and at all great festivals. But thou must
observe the path of moderation, for wise men do not consider it right
to drink to such an extent as to destroy the understanding, and it is
necessary that from drinking only profit should be derived.&rdquo;
B&#363; &#703;Al&#299; (Avicenna), who is one of the most learned of
hakims and physicians, has written this quatrain&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="par">With much trouble wine was given to him. I had not drunk
it till I was 15<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6682src" href="#xd24e6682"
name="xd24e6682src">32</a> years old, except when in the time of my
infancy two or three times my mother and wet-nurses gave it by way of
infantile remedy. They asked for a little spirit from my revered
father, and gave it me to the extent of a tola mixed with water and
rosewater to take away a cough, designating it as medicine. At the time
when the camp of my revered father had been pitched in order to put
down the disturbance of Y&#363;sufza&#702;e Afghans at the fort of
Attock, which is on the bank of the N&#299;l&#257;b (Indus) River, one
day I had mounted to go out to hunt. When I had moved about a good deal
and the signs of weariness had set in, a gunner of the name of
Ust&#257;d S&#863;h&#257;h-qul&#299;, a wonderful gunner out of those
under my revered uncle M&#299;rz&#257; Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;ak&#299;m,
said to me that if I would take a cup of wine it would drive away the
feeling of being tired and heavy. It was in the time of my youth, and
as I felt disposed towards it I ordered Mahm&#363;d, the
&#256;b-d&#257;r (person in charge of drinking water, etc.), to go to
the house of H&#803;ak&#299;m &#703;Al&#299; and bring me an
intoxicating draught. He sent me<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6685src"
href="#xd24e6685" name="xd24e6685src">33</a> the amount of one and a
half cups of yellow wine of a sweet taste in a little bottle. I drank
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>it, and found its quality agreeable. After that
I took to drinking wine, and increased it from day to day until wine
made from grapes ceased to intoxicate me, and I took to drinking arrack
(<i>&#703;araq</i>, spirits), and by degrees during nine years my
potions rose to twenty cups of doubly distilled spirits, fourteen
during the daytime and the remainder at night. The weight of this was
six Hindustani sirs or one and a half maunds of Iran. The extent of my
eating in those days was a fowl<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6693src"
href="#xd24e6693" name="xd24e6693src">34</a> with bread and vegetables
(lit. radish).<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6719src" href="#xd24e6719"
name="xd24e6719src">35</a> In that state of matters no one had the
power to forbid me, and matters went to such a length that in the
crapulous state from the excessive trembling of my hand I could not
drink from my own cup, but others had to give it me to drink, until I
sent for H&#803;ak&#299;m Hum&#257;m, brother of H&#803;ak&#299;m
Ab&#363;-l-fath&#803;, who was of the most intimate with my revered
father, and informed him of my state. He, with excessive sincerity and
unfeigned burning of heart, said to me without hesitation, &ldquo;Lord
of the world, by the way in which you drink spirits, God forbid it, but
in six months matters will come to such a pass that there will be no
remedy for it.&rdquo; As his words were said out of pure good-will, and
sweet life was dear to me, they made an impression on me, and from that
day I began to lessen my allowance and set myself to take
<i>fil&#363;n&#299;y&#257;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6728src"

increased the amount of filuniya.</p>
<p class="par">I also ordered that the arrack should be diluted with
wine of the grape so that there should be two parts wine and one part
arrack. Every day I diminished the quantity I took, and in the course
of seven years I brought it down to six cups. The weight of each cupful
was 18&frac14; misqals. It is now fifteen years that I have drunk at
this rate, neither more nor less. And my drinking time is the night
except on the day of Thursdays, as it is the day of the blessed
accession. Also on the eve<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6774src" href=
"#xd24e6774" name="xd24e6774src">37</a> of Friday, which is the most
blessed eve of the week, and is the prelude to a blessed day (I do not
drink). I drink at the end of each day with these two<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e6780src" href="#xd24e6780" name="xd24e6780src">38</a>
exceptions, for it does not appear right that this eve (Thursday night)
should be spent in neglect, and that there should be an omission (on
Friday) of returning thanks to the True Benefactor. On the day of
Thursday and on the day of Sunday I do not eat <span class=

my auspicious accession, and not on Sunday, because it is the birthday
of my revered father, and he greatly honoured and held dear the day.
After some time I substituted opium for filuniya. Now that my age has
arrived at 46 solar years and 4 months, I eat eight surkhs (a red berry
used as a weight) of opium when five gharis of day have passed, and six
surkhs after one watch of night.</p>

left Iran for Hindustan, my exalted brother S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;Abb&#257;s sent me by his hand a rosary of cornelian from Yemen

offerings of many kinds of jewelled ornaments, etc., which
Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z had sent to me, were laid before me. On

I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, who was permanently employed as Bakhshi,

and tutor to Karan&rsquo;s son. By his hand I also sent a mace of gold
(<i>s&#863;has&#863;hpar&#299;</i>) for the R&#257;n&#257;.</p>
<p class="par">On the 20th of the same month, R&#257;ja S&#363;raj
Singh, son of R&#257;ja B&#257;so, who on account of the nearness of
his dwelling-place to it had been sent with Murtaz&#803;&#257;
K&#863;h&#257;n to capture the fort of K&#257;ngra, came on my summons
and waited on me. The aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n had entertained certain
suspicions with regard to him, and on this account, considering him an
undesirable companion, had repeatedly sent petitions to the Court, and
wrote things about him until an order was received to summon him.</p>
<p class="par">On the 26th, Niz&#804;&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n
K&#863;h&#257;n came from Multan and waited on me. In the end of this
year news of victory and prosperity came in from all sides of my
dominions. In the first place, this was with regard to the disturbance
of Ah&#803;d&#257;d, the Afghan, who for a long time past had been in
rebellion in the hill country of Kabul, and round whom many of the
Afghans of that neighbourhood had assembled, and against whom from the
time of my revered father until now, which is the 10th year after my
accession, armies have always been employed. He by degrees was
defeated, and, falling into a wretched state, a part of his band was
dispersed and a part killed. He took refuge for some time in
Chark&#863;h, which was a place on which he relied, but K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n surrounded it and closed the road for entry and exit. When
there remained no grass for his beasts or means of living for men in
the fortress, he at night brought down his animals from the hills and
grazed them on the skirts, and accompanied them himself, in order that
he might set an example to his men. At last this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>intelligence reached K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n. He then appointed a body of his leaders and experienced
men to go into ambush on an appointed night in the neighbourhood of
Chark&#863;h. That band went and hid itself at night in places of
refuge, and K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n rode on the same day in that
direction. When those ill-fated ones brought out their cattle and let
them loose to graze, and the ill-conditioned Ah&#803;d&#257;d himself
passed by the places of ambush with his own band, suddenly a dust rose
in front of him. When they enquired it became known that it was
K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n. In a state of bewilderment he endeavoured
to turn back, and the scouts announced to the aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n
that it was Ah&#803;d&#257;d. The K&#863;h&#257;n gave his horse the
reins and went at Ah&#803;d&#257;d; the men who were in ambush also
blocked the road and attacked him. The fight lasted till midday in
consequence of the broken nature of the ground and the thickness of the
jungle; at last defeat fell on the Afghans and they betook themselves
to the hill: about 300 fighting men went to hell and 100 were taken
prisoners. Ah&#803;d&#257;d could not regain the stronghold and hold on
there. Necessarily he turned his face towards Qandahar. The victorious
troops entering Chark&#863;h, burnt all the places and houses of those
ill-fortuned ones, and destroyed and rooted them up from their
foundations.</p>
<p class="par">Another<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6803src" href=
"#xd24e6803" name="xd24e6803src">39</a> piece of news was the defeat of
the ill-starred &#703;Ambar and the destruction of his unfortunate
army. Briefly, a band of the influential leaders and a body of
Barg&#299;s (Mahrattas), who are a hardy lot and who are the centre of
resistance in that country, becoming angry with &#703;Ambar, showed an
intention to be loyal, and begging for quarter from
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n, who was in
B&#257;l&#257;p&#363;r with an army of royal troops, agreed to
interview the said K&#863;h&#257;n, and being satisfied, &#256;dam
K&#863;h&#257;n, Y&#257;q&#363;t K&#863;h&#257;n, <span class=

S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n gave each of them a horse,
an elephant, money, and dress of honour, according to their quality and
condition, made them hot in duty and loyalty, and marching from Balapur
started against the rebel &#703;Ambar in their company. On the road
they fell in with an army of the Dakhanis, whose leaders were
Mah&#803;alld&#257;r,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6811src" href=

others, and routed it.</p>
<div class="lgouter">

name="xd24e6820src">42</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par first">They reached the camp of that ill-starred one, and
he from excessive pride determined to fight with the victorious troops.
Having collected those rebels who were with him and &#703;&#256;dil
K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s army and that of Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk together,
and preparing their artillery, he started to meet the royal troops
until a space of not more than 5 or 6 kos remained between. On Sunday,
the 25th Bahman, the armies of light and darkness approached each other
and the scouts became visible. Three watches of day had passed when
cannon and rocket firing began. In the end D&#257;r&#257;b
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was in command of the vanguard, with other leaders
and zealous men such as R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo, R&#257;y Chand,
&#703;Al&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n the Tatar, Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299;
Beg Turkm&#257;n, and other lions of the forest of bravery, drew their
swords and charged the vanguard of the enemy. Performing the dues of
manliness and bravery, they scattered this army like the
Ban&#257;tu-n-na&#703;s&#863;h (&lsquo;Daughters of the Bier,&rsquo;
i.e. the Great Bear); and not stopping there they attacked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>the
enemy&rsquo;s centre. Turning on the army opposed to them, such a
hand-to-hand struggle took place that the onlookers remained
bewildered. For nearly two gharis this combat went on. Heaps of the
dead lay there, and the ill-starred &#703;Ambar, unable to offer
further opposition, turned his face to flight. If darkness<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6846src" href="#xd24e6846" name=
"xd24e6846src">43</a> and gloom had not come on at the cry of those
black-fortuned ones, not one of them would have found the road to the
valley of safety. The crocodiles of the river of conflict followed the
fugitives for 2 or 3 kos. When horses and men could move no more and
the defeated were scattered, they drew rein and returned to their
places. The whole of the enemy&rsquo;s artillery, with 300 laden camels
that carried rockets, war elephants, Arab and Persian horses, weapons
and armour beyond reckoning, fell into the hands of the servants of the
State, and there was no counting the slain and the fallen. A great many
of the leaders fell alive into their hands. The next day the victorious
troops, marching from the place of victory, proceeded to Kark&#299;,
which was the nest of those owlish ones, and seeing no trace of them
they encamped there, and obtained news that they during that night and
day had fallen miserably in different places. For some days the
victorious army, delayed at Kark&#299;, levelled with the dark earth
the buildings and houses of the enemy, and burnt that populous place.
In consequence of the occurrence of certain events, to describe which
in detail would take too long here, they returned from that place and
descended by the Rohan Khan&#7693;a Pass. In reward for this service I
ordered increases to be made in the mansabs of a number who had shown
zeal and bravery.</p>
<p class="par">The third piece of news was the conquest of the province
of Khokhar&#257;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6851src" href="#xd24e6851"
name="xd24e6851src">44</a> and the acquisition of the diamond
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>mines, which were taken by the excellent
exertions of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n. This province is one of
the dependencies of the Subah of Behar and Patna. There is a river
there from which they procure diamonds. At the season when there is
little water, there are pools and water-holes, and it has become known
by experience to those who are employed in this work that above every
water-hole in which there are diamonds, there are crowds of flying
animals of the nature of gnats, and which in the language of India they
call <i>jh&#299;ng&#257;</i>(?).<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6859src"
href="#xd24e6859" name="xd24e6859src">45</a> Keeping the bed of the
stream in sight as far as it is accessible, they make a collection of
stones (<i>sangch&#299;n</i>) round the water-holes. After this they
empty the water-holes with spades and shovels to the extent of a yard
or 1&frac12; yards and dig up the area. They find among the stones and
sand large and small diamonds<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6897src" href=
"#xd24e6897" name="xd24e6897src">46</a> and bring them out. It
occasionally happens that they find a piece of diamond worth 100,000
rupees. Briefly, this province and this river were in possession of a
Hindu Zamindar of the name of Durjan S&#257;l, and although the
governors of the Subah frequently sent armies against him and went
there themselves, in consequence of the difficult roads and thickness
of the jungles they contented themselves with taking two or three
diamonds and left him in his former condition. When the aforesaid Subah
was transferred from Z&#804;afar K&#863;h&#257;n, and Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
K&#863;h&#257;n was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316"
name="pb316">316</a>]</span>appointed in his place, at the time of his
taking leave I ordered him to go and take the province out of the
possession of that unknown and insignificant individual. As soon as he
arrived in the province of Behar he assembled a force and went against
that Zamindar. According to former custom he sent some of his men with
a promise to give some diamonds and some elephants, but the
K&#863;h&#257;n did not agree to this and entered impetuously into the
province. Before the fellow could collect his men he found guides and
invaded it. Just when the zamindar received this news, the hills and
vales that are his abode were beleaguered. Ibr&#257;h&#299;m sent men
about to find him and they got hold of him in a cave with several
women, one of whom was his mother, while others were also his
father&rsquo;s wives. They arrested him, and also one of his brothers.
They searched and took from them the diamonds they had with them.
Twenty-three male and female elephants also fell into
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m&rsquo;s hands. In reward for this service the mansab
of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n original and increase, was made up
to 4,000 personal and horse, and he was exalted with the title of
Fath&#803;-jang. Orders were also given for an increase in the mansabs
of those who accompanied him on this service and had shown bravery.
That province is now in possession of the imperial servants of the
State. They carry on work in the bed of the stream, and bring to Court
whatever diamonds are found. A large diamond, the value of which has
been estimated at 50,000 rupees, has lately been brought from there. If
a little pains are taken, it is probable that good diamonds will be
found and be placed in the jewel-room. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

I.O. MSS. and the R.A.S. MS. have 18 instead of 15. Elliot has
&ldquo;up to my fourteenth&rdquo; year. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r was born in
Rab&#299;&#703;, 977, or 31st August, 1569, and the beginning of
wine-drinking to which he refers must have taken place at earliest in
January, 1586. He tells us that it was after the death of
Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;ak&#299;m, and at the time when his father was at
Attock. Now Akbar arrived there on 15th Muh&#803;arram, 994, according
to Niz&#804;&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n, and on 12th Day, 994, according to
Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l, iii, 976, i.e. about the end of December, 1585,
and at that time Jah&#257;ng&#299;r was 17 years and 4 months of age,
or in his 18th year. He continued to drink heavily for nine years, i.e.
till he was 26 (17 + 9), then he moderated for seven years, i.e. till
he was 33, and he kept to that for fifteen years more, i.e. till he was
48. These years were lunar years, and he tells that at the time of
writing he was 47 years and 9 months old, according to the lunar
calendar. It seems to follow that the MSS. are right, and that we
should read 18.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<i>Fil&#363;n&#299;y&#257;.</i> The word is not given in ordinary
dictionaries, but it is explained in Dozy&rsquo;s Supplement. It is
stated there that it is a sedative electuary, and that the word is
derived from the Greek, being <span class="trans" title=
"phil&#333;nia"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&phi;&iota;&lambda;&omega;&nu;&iota;&alpha;</span></span>, which
is the name of an antidote or drug invented by Philon of Tarsus. There
is an account of Philon and a reference to his drug in Smith&rsquo;s
Classical Dictionary. Philon lived in or before the first century after
Christ, and is referred to by Galen and others. The word as given there
is <span class="trans" title="phil&#333;neion"><span class="Greek"
lang="grc">&phi;&iota;&lambda;&omega;&nu;&epsilon;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</span></span>.
We are not told what it was made of. In Price&rsquo;s
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, filuniya, misread there as Kelourica, is described
by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r as brother&rsquo;s son to <i>tiry&#257;q</i>,
i.e. theriaca (see Price, p. 6). <i>Tiry&#257;k</i> or
<i>t&#804;iry&#257;q</i> is supposed to be a Greek word (see Lane), and
means an antidote against poison, etc. It is so used in the verse from
Avicenna quoted by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r to his son S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n. See D&rsquo;Herbelot, s.v. <i>Teriak</i>. But it is also
often used apparently as a synonym for opium. The mixing of wine with
spirits was intended to dilute the potation, for hitherto
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r had been taking raw spirit. A
<i>mis&#804;q&#257;l</i> is said to be 63&frac12; grains troy, and so
18 misqals would be about 3 ounces, and the six cups would be about
1&frac12; lb. troy. In Elliot, Jah&#257;ng&#299;r is made to say that
he does not drink on Thursdays and Fridays. But the
<i>s&#863;hab-i-jum&#703;a</i>, as Blochmann has pointed out elsewhere,
&#256;y&#299;n translation, p. 171, n. 3, means Thursday night or
Friday eve, and this is clearly the case here, for Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
speaks of the eve&rsquo;s being followed by a blessed day. It should be
noted that there is no connection in Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s mind
between abstaining from wine and abstaining from meat. He did not eat
meat on Thursdays or Sundays because he did not approve of taking life
on these days, but he drank on both of them.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

<h2 class="main">The Eleventh New Year&rsquo;s Feast after the
auspicious Accession.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Fifteen gharis of day had passed on Sunday, the
last day of Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;, corresponding with the 1st
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal (19th March, 1616), when from the mansion of
Pisces the sun cast the ray of prosperity on the palace of Aries. At
this auspicious hour, having performed the dues of service and
supplication at the throne of Almighty God, I ascended the throne of
State in the public audience hall, the area of which was laid out with
tents and canopies (<i>s&#863;h&#257;miy&#257;nah&#257;</i>), and its
sides adorned with European screens, painted gold brocades, and rare
cloths. The princes, Amirs, the chief courtiers, the ministers of
State, and all the servants of the Court performed their congratulatory
salutations. As H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804; N&#257;d &#703;Al&#299;,
<i>g&#363;yanda</i> (singer), was one of the ancient servants, I
ordered that whatever offerings were made on the Monday by anyone in
the shape of cash or goods should be given to him by way of reward. On
the 2nd day (of Farward&#299;n) the offerings of some of the
employ&eacute;s were laid before me. On the 4th day the offering of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, who had sent them from Agra, and which
consisted of several diamonds and pearls, of jewelled things, cloth
stuffs of all kinds, and an elephant, worth altogether 50,000 rupees,
was brought before me. On the 5th day, Kunwar Karan, who had been given
leave to go to his home, returned and waited on me. He presented as
offering 100 muhrs, 1,000 rupees, an elephant with fittings, and four
horses. To the mansab of &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, which was
4,000 personal and 2,000 horse, I on the 7th made an addition of 1,000
personal and 2,000 horse, and honoured him with drums and a standard.
On this day the offering of M&#299;r Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n
H&#803;usain was laid before me; what he offered was approved and
accepted. Among the things was a jewelled dagger which had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span>been
made under his superintendence.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6917src"
href="#xd24e6917" name="xd24e6917src">1</a> On its hilt was a yellow
ruby<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6926src" href="#xd24e6926" name=
"xd24e6926src">2</a> (<i>y&#257;q&#363;t-i-zard</i>), exceeding clear
and bright, in size equal to half a hen&rsquo;s egg. I had never before
seen so large and beautiful a yellow ruby. Along with it were other
rubies of approved colour and old emeralds. Brokers
(<i>muq&#299;m&#257;n</i>) valued it (the dagger) at 50,000 rupees. I
increased the mansab of the said M&#299;r by 1,000 horse, which brought
it to 5,000 personal and 3,500 horse. On the 8th I increased the mansab
of S&#257;diq H&#803;&#257;z&#817;iq by 300 personal and horse, and
that of Ir&#257;dat K&#863;h&#257;n by 300 personal and 200 horse, so
as to raise each to 1,000 personal and 500 horse. On the 9th the
offering of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan was laid before
me; of jewelled ornaments and cloth stuffs, what was of the value of
40,000 rupees was accepted, and the remainder I made a present to him.
The offering of T&#257;t&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n Bak&#257;wul-beg&#299;,
consisting of one ruby (<i>la&#703;l</i>), one <i>y&#257;q&#363;t</i>,
a jewelled <i>tak&#863;ht&#299;</i> (signet?), two rings, and some
cloths, was accepted. On the 10th three elephants which R&#257;ja
Mah&#257; Singh sent from the Deccan, and 100 and odd pieces of gold
brocade, etc., which Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n sent from
Lahore, were laid before me. On this date Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n
presented his offering of two pearl rosaries, two rubies, six large
pearls, and one gold tray, to the value of 28,000 rupees. At the end of
Thursday, the 11th, I went to the house of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah
in order to add to his dignity. He then presented me with his offering,
and I examined it in detail. Much of it was exceedingly rare. Of jewels
there were two pearls worth 30,000 rupees, one <i>qut&#804;b&#299;</i>
ruby which had been purchased for 22,000 rupees, with other pearls and
rubies. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>Altogether the value was 110,000 rupees. These
had the honour of acceptance, and of cloth, etc., the value of 15,000
rupees was taken. When I had finished inspecting the offering I passed
nearly one watch of the night in conviviality and enjoyment. I ordered
that cups (of wine) should be given to the Amirs and servants. The
ladies of the <i>mah&#803;all</i> (harem) were also with me, and a
pleasant assembly was held. After the festive assembly was over I
begged I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah to excuse me, and went to the hall
of audience. On the same day I ordered N&#363;r-mah&#803;all Begam to
be called N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam. On the 12th the offering of
I&#703;tib&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n was laid before me. They had made a
vessel (<i>z&#804;arf</i>) in the form of a fish, jewelled with
beautiful gems, exceedingly well shaped and calculated to hold my
allowance.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6957src" href="#xd24e6957" name=
"xd24e6957src">3</a> This, with other jewels and jewelled things and
cloth stuffs, the value of which was worth 56,000 rupees, I accepted
and gave back the rest. Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of
Qandahar, had sent seven Iraq horses and nine <i>tuq&#363;z</i> (81?)
of cloth stuffs. The offerings of Ir&#257;dat K&#863;h&#257;n and
R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Mal, son of R&#257;ja B&#257;so, were laid before
me on the 13th. &#703;Abdu-s-Subh&#803;&#257;n, who held a mansab of
1,200 personal and 600 horse, was promoted to 1,500 personal and 700
horse. On the 15th the Subahdarship of the province of Thatha was
transferred from S&#863;hams&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n &#362;zbeg
to Muz&#804;affar K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 16th the offering of
I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n, son of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah,
was laid before me. Of this the equivalent of 32,000 rupees was taken,
and I gave back the rest to him. On the 17th the offering of Tarbiyat
K&#863;h&#257;n was inspected. Of jewels and cloth what was valued at
17,000 rupees was approved. On the 18th I went to the house of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, and his offering was presented to me
there. From the palace <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href=
"#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>to his house was a distance of
about a kos. For half the distance he had laid down under foot velvet
woven with gold and gold brocade and plain velvet, such that its value
was represented to me as 10,000 rupees. I passed that day until
midnight at his house with the ladies. The offerings he had prepared
were laid before me in detail. Jewels, jewelled ornaments, and things
of gold and beautiful cloth stuffs, things of the value of 114,000
rupees, four horses, and one camel were approved of. On the 19th
(Farward&#299;n), which was the day of honour
(<i>r&#363;z-i-s&#863;haraf</i>) of the sun, a grand assembly was held
in the palace. In order to observe the auspicious hour, when 2&frac12;
gharis of day were left of the aforesaid day, I seated myself on the
throne. My son B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram at this blessed hour laid
before me a ruby of the purest water and brilliancy, which they
pronounced to be of the value of 80,000 rupees. I fixed his mansab,
which was 15,000 personal and 8,000 horse, at 20,000 personal and
10,000 horse. On the same day my lunar weighing took place. I increased
the mansab of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, which was 6,000 personal and
3,000 horse, to 7,000 personal and 5,000 horse, and bestowed on him a
<i>t&#363;m&#257;n t&#363;g&#863;h</i> (horse-tail standard), and
ordered his drums to be beaten after those of my son K&#863;hurram. I
increased the mansab of Tarbiyat K&#863;h&#257;n by 500 personal and
horse, so as to bring it to 3,500 personal and 1,500 horse. The mansab
of I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n was increased by 1,000 personal
and 400 horse. Niz&#804;&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n was
promoted to 700 personal and 300 horse, and appointed to the Subah of
Behar. Sal&#257;mu-llah, the Arab, was honoured with the title of
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n, and, being dignified with a
necklace of pearls, became one of the royal<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6975src" href="#xd24e6975" name="xd24e6975src">4</a> servants. I
promoted M&#299;r Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n Inj&#363; to the title of
&#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daulah (Arm of the State). On the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>21st
Almighty God gave K&#863;husrau a son by the daughter of Muq&#299;m,
son of Mihtar F&#257;z&#803;il Rik&#257;b-d&#257;r (stirrup-holder). To
Allah-d&#257;d, the Afghan, who, accepting my service, had separated
himself from the evil-minded Ah&#803;d&#257;d and come to Court, I gave
20,000 darabs (10,000 rupees). On the 25th came the news of the death
of R&#257;y Manohar, who had been attached to the army of the Deccan.
Giving his son a mansab of 500 personal and 300 horse, I bestowed upon
him his father&rsquo;s place and property. On the 26th the offering of
N&#257;d &#703;Al&#299; Maid&#257;n&#299;, consisting of nine horses,
several bits (? <i>dah&#257;na k&#299;s&#863;h</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd24e6984src" href="#xd24e6984" name="xd24e6984src">5</a>), and
four Persian camels (<i>wil&#257;yat&#299;</i>), was brought before me.
On the 28th I presented Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of
Qandahar, M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n, son of K&#863;hal&#299;lu-llah, and
Sayyid B&#257;yaz&#299;d, governor of Bhakar, each with an elephant. On
the 1st Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, at the request of &#703;Abdu-llah
K&#863;h&#257;n, I presented drums to his brother Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 3rd I gave Allah-d&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n, the
Afghan, a jewelled <i>khapwa</i> (dagger). On the same day news came
that Qadam,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7000src" href="#xd24e7000" name=
"xd24e7000src">6</a> one of the Afr&#299;d&#299; Afghans who had been
loyal and obedient, and to whom the <i>r&#257;h-d&#257;r&#299;</i>
(transit dues) of the Khaibar Pass belonged, from some slight suspicion
had withdrawn his feet from the circle of obedience and raised his head
in sedition. He had sent a force against each of the posts
(<i>th&#257;na</i>), and wherever he and his men went, through the
carelessness of those men (in the posts), had plundered and killed many
of the people. Briefly, in consequence of the shameful action of this
senseless Afghan, a new disturbance broke out in the hill country of
Kabul. When this news arrived I ordered H&#257;r&#363;n, brother of
Qadam, and Jal&#257;l, his son, who were at Court, to be apprehended
and handed over to &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n to be imprisoned in
the fort of Gwalior. By the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href=
"#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>manifestation of the Divine mercy
and kindness and the signs of God&rsquo;s favour, an affair took place
at this time which is not devoid of strangeness. After the victory over
the R&#257;n&#257; my son presented me in Ajmir with an exceedingly
beautiful and clear ruby, valued at 60,000 rupees. It occurred to me
that I ought to bind this ruby on my own arm. I much wanted two rare
pearls of good water of one form to be a fit match for this kind of
ruby. Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n had procured one grand pearl of the
value of 20,000 rupees, and given it to me as a New Year&rsquo;s
offering. It occurred to me that if I could procure a pair to it they
would make a perfect bracelet. K&#863;hurram, who from his childhood
had had the honour of waiting on my revered father, and remained in
attendance on him day and night, represented to me that he had seen a
pearl in an old turban (<i>sar-band</i>) of a weight and shape equal to
this pearl. They produced an old <i>sar-p&#299;ch</i> (worn on the
turban), containing a royal pearl of the same quality, weight, and
shape, not differing in weight even by a trifle, so much so that the
jewellers were astonished at the matter. It agreed in value, shape,
lustre, and brilliance; one might say they had been shed from the same
mould. Placing the two pearls alongside of the ruby, I bound them on my
arm, and placing my head on the ground of supplication and humility, I
returned thanks to the Lord that cherished His slave, and made my
tongue utter His praise&mdash;</p>

<p class="par first">On the 5th (Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht) 30 Iraq and
Turki horses that Murtaz&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n had sent from Lahore

guns, etc., from K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n, which he had sent from
Kabul, were accepted. Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n presented an offering of
a small elephant from Abyssinia which they had brought by sea in a
ship. In comparison with the elephants of Hindustan it presents some
peculiarities. Its ears are larger than the ears of the elephants of
this place, and its trunk and tail are longer. In the time of my
revered father I&#703;tim&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n of Cujarat sent a
young elephant<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7048src" href="#xd24e7048"
name="xd24e7048src">9</a> as an offering; by degrees it grew up and was
very fiery and bad-tempered. On the 7th a jewelled dagger was given to
Muz&#804;affar K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of Thatha. On the same day
news came that a band of Afghans<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7051src"
href="#xd24e7051" name="xd24e7051src">10</a> had attacked
&#703;Abdu-s-Subh&#803;&#257;n, brother of K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam, who was stationed at one of the posts, and had laid
siege to his post. &#703;Abdu-s-Subh&#803;&#257;n, with certain other
mansabdars and servants who had been appointed to go with him had
behaved valiantly. But at last, in accordance with the
saying&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;When gnats get wings they smite the
elephant,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">those dogs overcame them, and elevated

the dignity of martyrdom.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7059src" href=
"#xd24e7059" name="xd24e7059src">11</a> As a condolence for this affair
a gracious farman and a special dress of honour were sent to
K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, who had been appointed ambassador to
Iran (and was still in that country). On the 14th the offering of
Mukarram K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Mu&#703;azzam K&#863;h&#257;n, came
from Bengal. It consisted of jewels and articles procurable in that
province, and was brought before me. I increased the mansab of some of
the jagirdars of Gujarat. Of these, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb324" href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, whose mansab was that of 1,000 personal and 500 horse,
was raised to 1,500 personal and 300<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7064src" href="#xd24e7064" name="xd24e7064src">12</a> horse, and
had a standard given to him as well. Sayyid Q&#257;sim, son of Sayyid
Dil&#257;war B&#257;rha, was raised to an original and increased mansab
of 800 personal and 450 horse, and Y&#257;r Beg, nephew of Ah&#803;mad
Q&#257;sim Koka, to one of 600 personal with 250 horse. On the 17th
there came the news of the death of Razz&#257;q of Merv, the &#362;zbeg
who belonged to the army of the Deccan. He was well skilled in war, and
one of the distinguished Amirs of M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr. On
the 21st, Allah-d&#257;d, the Afghan, was honoured with the title of
K&#863;h&#257;n, and his mansab, which was 1,000 personal and 600
horse, was raised to 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. Three hundred
thousand rupees out of the treasury of Lahore were ordered as a reward
and for expenses to K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n, who had greatly
exerted himself in the Afghan disturbance. On the 28th, Kunwar Karan
obtained leave to go home for his marriage. I conferred on him a dress
of honour, a special Iraq horse with a saddle, an elephant, and a
jewelled waist-dagger. On the 3rd of this month
(K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d) the news of the death of Murtaz&#803;&#257;
K&#863;h&#257;n came. He was one of the ancients of this State. My
revered father had brought him up and raised him to a position of
consequence and trust. In my reign also he obtained the grace of
noteworthy service, namely the overthrow of K&#863;husrau. His mansab
had been raised to 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse. As he was at this
time Subahdar of the Panjab, he had undertaken the capture of
K&#257;ngra, to which in strength no other fort in the hill country of
that province or even in the whole inhabited world can be compared. He
had obtained leave to go on this duty. I was much grieved in mind at
this news; in truth, grief at the death of such <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>a
loyal follower is only reasonable. As he had died after spending his
days in loyalty, I prayed to God for pardon for him. On the 4th
K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d the mansab of Sayyid Niz&#804;&#257;m was
fixed, original and increase, at 900 personal and 650 horse. I gave
N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299; the post of entertainer to the
ambassadors from all parts. On the 7th news came of the death of Saif
K&#863;h&#257;n B&#257;rha; he was a brave and ambitious young man. He
had exerted himself in an exemplary way in the battle with
K&#863;husrau. He bade farewell to this perishable world in the Deccan
through cholera (<i>haiz&#803;a</i>). I conferred favours on his sons.
&#703;Al&#299; Muh&#803;ammad, who was the eldest and most upright of
his children, was given the mansab of 300<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7073src" href="#xd24e7073" name="xd24e7073src">13</a> personal
and 400 horse, and his (&#703;Al&#299; Muh&#803;ammad&rsquo;s) brother,
by name Bah&#257;dur, that of 400 personal and 200 horse. Sayyid
&#703;Al&#299;, who was his nephew, received an increase in rank of 500
personal and horse. On the same day K&#863;h&#363;b-Allah, son of
S&#863;h&#257;h-b&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n Kamb&#363;, received the title
of Ran-b&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n. On the 8th<a class="noteref" id=

of H&#257;shim K&#863;h&#257;n, original and increase, was fixed at
2,500 personal and 1,800 horse. On this date I bestowed 20,000
<i>darabs</i> (10,000 rupees) on Allah-d&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n, the
Afghan. Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, Raja of the province of B&#257;ndh&#363;,
whose ancestors were considerable zamindars in Hindustan, through the
patronage of my fortunate son B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram, obtained
the blessing of paying his respects to me, and his offences were
pardoned. On the 9th,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7085src" href=
"#xd24e7085" name="xd24e7085src">15</a> Kaly&#257;n of Jesalm&#299;r,
to summon whom R&#257;ja Kishan D&#257;s had gone, came and waited on
me. He presented 100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees. His elder brother
R&#257;wal Bh&#299;m was a person of distinction. When he died he left
a son 2 months old, and he too did not live <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=

his daughter in marriage, and called her by the title of
Malika-Jah&#257;n<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7090src" href="#xd24e7090"
name="xd24e7090src">16</a> (queen of the world). As the ancestors of
this tribe had come of ancient loyal people, this alliance took place.
Having summoned the aforesaid Kaly&#257;n, who was the brother of
R&#257;wal Bh&#299;m, I exalted<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7094src"
href="#xd24e7094" name="xd24e7094src">17</a> him with the
<i>t&#299;ka</i> of R&#257;ja and the title of R&#257;wal. News came
that after the death of Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n loyalty was
shown by R&#257;ja M&#257;n, and that, after giving encouragement to
the men of the fort of K&#257;ngra an arrangement had been made that he
should bring to Court the son of the Raja of that country, who was 29
years old. In consequence of his great zeal in this service, I fixed
his mansab, which was 1,000 personal and 800 horse, at 1,500 personal
and 1,000 horse. K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n was promoted from his
original and increased mansab to that of 4,000 personal and 2,500
horse. On this date<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7100src" href=
"#xd24e7100" name="xd24e7100src">18</a> an event occurred such that,
although I was greatly desirous of writing it down, my hand and heart

pustules (<i>&#257;bila</i>) appeared, and on the 26th of the same
month, corresponding with Wednesday, the 29th Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal
(15th June, 1616), in the year 1025, the bird of her soul flew from her
elemental cage and passed into the gardens of Paradise. From this date
an order was given that Ch&#257;r-s&#863;hamba (Wednesday) should be
called Kam-s&#863;hamba (or <i>Gum-s&#863;hamba</i>). What shall I
write as to what happened to the pure personality of the shadow of God
in consequence of this heartburning event and grief-increasing
calamity? Inasmuch as it happened after this manner to that soul of the
world, what must be the condition of those other<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7126src" href="#xd24e7126" name="xd24e7126src">22</a> servants
whose life was bound up with that pure personality? For two days the
servants were not received in audience, and an order was given that a
wall should be built in front of the house which had been the abode of
that bird of paradise, so that it might not be seen. In addition to
this he did not adorn the gate of the hall of audience (did not come
there). On the third day he went in an agitated state to the house of
the illustrious prince, and the servants had the good fortune to pay
their salutations and found fresh life. On the road, however much the
H&#803;az&#803;rat (the Emperor) desired to control himself, the tears
flowed from the auspicious eyes, and for a long time it was so that at
the mere hearing of a word from which came a whiff of pain, the state
of the H&#803;az&#803;rat became bewildered. He remained for some days
in the house of the prince of the inhabitants of the world, and on
Monday<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7129src" href="#xd24e7129" name=
"xd24e7129src">23</a> of T&#299;r, Divine month, he went to the house
of &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, and turned back thence to the

himself there. But as long as he was in Ajmir he could not control
himself. Whenever the word &lsquo;friendship&rsquo; reached his ear,
the tears would drop from his eyes unrestrained, and the hearts of his
faithful followers were torn in pieces. When the departure of the
cort&egrave;ge of fortune to the Subah of the Deccan took place, he
gained a little composure.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On this date Prith&#299; Chand, son of R&#257;y Manohar,
obtained the title of Ray and the mansab of 500 personal and 400 horse,
and a jagir in his native place. On Saturday, the 11th, I went from the
Chas&#863;hma-i-N&#363;r to the palace at Ajmir. On the eve of Sunday,
the 12th, after 37 seconds had passed, at the time of the ascension of
Sagittarius to the 27th degree, by the calculations of the Hindu
astronomers, and the 15th degree of Capricorn, by the calculations of
the Greeks, there came from the womb of the daughter of &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n (wife of K&#863;hurram) a precious pearl into the world
of being. With joy and gladness at this great boon the drums beat
loudly, and the door of pleasure and enjoyment was opened in the face
of the people. Without delay or reflection the name of S&#863;h&#257;h
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at came to my tongue. I hope that his coming will
be auspicious and blessed to me and to his father. On the 12th a
jewelled dagger<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7136src" href="#xd24e7136"
name="xd24e7136src">24</a> and an elephant were bestowed on R&#257;wal
Kaly&#257;n of Jesalm&#299;r. On the same day arrived the news of the
death of K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K&#863;h&#257;n, whose jagir
was in the Sarkar of Qanauj. I gave an elephant to R&#257;y Kunwar,
Diwan of Gujarat. On the 22nd of the same month (T&#299;r) I added 500
personal and horse to the mansab of R&#257;ja Mah&#257; Singh, so as to
make it one of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse. The mansab of
&#703;Al&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n Tat&#257;r&#299;, who before this had
been exalted with the title of Nu&#7779;rat K&#863;h&#257;n, was fixed
at 2,000 personal and 500 horse, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb329" href="#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>a standard was also
conferred on him. With a view to the accomplishment of certain
purposes, I had made a vow that they should place a gold railing with
lattice-work at<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7141src" href="#xd24e7141"
name="xd24e7141src">25</a> the enlightened tomb of the revered
K&#863;hw&#257;ja. On the 27th of this month it was completed, and I
ordered them to take and affix it. It had been made at a cost of
110,000 rupees. As the command and leading of the victorious army of
the Deccan had not been carried out to my satisfaction by my son
Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z, it occurred to me to recall him, and
send B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram as the advanced guard of the
victorious army, inasmuch as the signs of rectitude and knowledge of
affairs were evident in him, and that I myself would follow him, so
that this important matter would be carried through in one and the same
campaign. With this object a farman had already been sent in the name
of Parw&#299;z ordering him to start for the Subah of Allahabad, which
is in the centre of my dominions. Whilst I was engaged in the campaign,
he would be entrusted with the guarding and administration of that
region. On the 29th of the same month a letter came from
Bih&#257;r&#299; D&#257;s, the news-writer of Burh&#257;np&#363;r, that
the prince on the 20th had left the city safely and well and gone
towards the aforesaid Subah. On the 1st Amurd&#257;d I bestowed a
jewelled turban on M&#299;rz&#257; R&#257;ja Bh&#257;o Singh. An
elephant was conferred on the shrine of Kus&#863;ht&#299;g&#299;r. On
the 18th, Las&#863;hkar K&#863;h&#257;n had sent four ambling
(<i>r&#257;hw&#257;r</i>) horses, and they were brought before me.
M&#299;r Mughal was appointed to the faujd&#257;rship of the Sarkar of
Sambal in the place of Sayyid &#703;Abdu-l-W&#257;ris&#804;, who had
obtained the governorship of the Subah of Qanauj in the place of
K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K&#863;h&#257;n. His mansab, in view of
that duty, was fixed at 500 personal and horse. On the 21st the
offering of R&#257;wal Kaly&#257;n of Jesalm&#299;r was laid before
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>me; it was 3,000 muhrs, 9 horses, 25 camels, and
1 elephant. The mansab of Qizil-b&#257;s&#863;h K&#863;h&#257;n was
fixed original and increase, at 1,200 personal and 1,000 horse. On the
23rd, S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n obtained leave to go to
his jagir that he might arrange the affairs of his servants and his
territory, and present himself at the time agreed upon. In this
year,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7153src" href="#xd24e7153" name=
"xd24e7153src">26</a> or rather in the 10th year after my accession, a
great pestilence appeared in some places in Hindustan. The commencement
of this calamity was in the parganahs of the Panjab, and by degrees the
contagion spread to the city of Lahore. Many of the people, Musulmans
and Hindus, died through this. After this it spread to Sirhind and the
D&#363;&#702;&#257;b, until it reached Delhi and the surrounding
parganahs and villages, and desolated them. At this day it had greatly
diminished. It became known from men of great age and from old
histories that this disease had never shown itself in this
country<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7156src" href="#xd24e7156" name=
"xd24e7156src">27</a> (before). Physicians and learned men were
questioned as to its cause. Some said that it came because there had
been drought for two years in succession and little rain fell: others
said it was on account of the corruption of the air which occurred
through the drought and scarcity. Some attributed it to other causes.

<p class="par first">On 5th S&#863;hahr&#299;war 5,000 rupees towards
her expenses were sent to the mother of M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n, the
daughter of S&#863;h&#257;h Isma&#703;&#299;l II, by merchants who were
proceeding to the province of Iraq. On the 6th a letter came from

Ahmadabad, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=

K&#863;h&#257;n Bah&#257;dur F&#299;r&#363;z-jang had quarrelled with
him because he had recorded among (current) events certain affairs that
had been unpleasing to him, and had sent a body of men against him, and
had insulted him by carrying him away to his house, and had done this
and that to him. This matter appeared serious to me, and I was desirous
at once to cast him out of favour and ruin him. At last it occurred to
me to send Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n to Ahmadabad to enquire into
this matter on the spot from disinterested people to see if it had
actually occurred and if so, to bring &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
with him to the Court, leaving the charge and administration of
Ahmadabad to Sard&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, his brother. Before
Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n started, the news reached
F&#299;r&#363;z-jang, and he in a state of great perturbation confessed
himself an offender and started for the Court on foot. Day&#257;nat
K&#863;h&#257;n met him on the road, and seeing him in a strange
condition, as he had wounded his feet with walking, he put him on
horseback, and taking him with him came to wait on me. Muqarrab
K&#863;h&#257;n, who is one of the old servants of the Court, from the
time when I was a prince had continually wanted the Subah of Gujarat.
It thus occurred to me that, as this kind of action on the part of
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n had come about, I might fulfil the hope
of an ancient servant and send him to Ahmadabad in the place of the
aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n. A fortunate hour was chosen in these days,
and I appointed him to be ruler of the Subah. On the 10th the mansab of
Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of Qandahar, which was 4,000
personal and 3,000 horse, was increased by 500 personal.</p>
<p class="par">S&#863;hauq&#299;, the mandolin player, is the wonder of

season for more than two months, and sent them every day fresh into the
special fruit store-house. As this was altogether an unusual thing to
be accomplished, it has been recorded here. On the 8th a beautiful Iraq
horse of the name of La&#703;l B&#299;-bah&#257; (priceless ruby) was
sent for Parw&#299;z by the hand of S&#863;har&#299;f, one of his

<p class="par">I had ordered quick-handed stone-cutters to carve
full-sized figures of the R&#257;n&#257; and his son Karan out of

solar weighing was held in the usual manner. The first weight came to
6,514 <i>t&#363;lcha</i> of gold. I was weighed twelve times against
different things; the second weighing was against quicksilver, the
third against silk, the fourth against various perfumes, such as
ambergris and musk, down to sandalwood, <i>&#703;&#363;d</i>,
<i>b&#257;n</i>, and so on, until twelve weighings were completed. Of

given to fakirs and dervishes. This rule has been observed from the

They divide after the weighing all these things among the fakirs and
those in need to the value of about 100,000 rupees.</p>

purchased at Burhanpur for 65,000 rupees from &#703;Abdu-llah

approved of. It is a ruby of beautiful form. The special mansab of
K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am was fixed at 7,000 personal, and an
order was passed that the diwani establishment should pay an equivalent
to that in a <i>tank&#863;hw&#257;h j&#257;g&#299;r</i>. At the request
of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, what had been deducted from the mansab
of Day&#257;nat on account of former proceedings was allowed to remain
as before. &#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daulah, who had obtained the Subah of
Malwa in jagir, took his leave, and was dignified with the gift of a
horse and a dress of honour. The mansab of R&#257;wal Kaly&#257;n of
Jesalmir was fixed at 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name="pb334">334</a>]</span>and
it was ordered that that province (Jesalmir) should be given him as
tankhwah. As the (auspicious) hour of his departure was on that same
day, he took leave to depart for his province well pleased and exalted
with the gift of a horse, an elephant, a jewelled sword, a jewelled
<i>khapwa</i> (dagger), a robe of honour, and a special Kashmir shawl.
On the 31st Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n took leave to go to Ahmadabad, and
his mansab, which was 5,000 personal and 2,500 horse, was fixed at
5,000 personal and horse, and he was honoured with a dress of honour, a

him. He went off to the aforesaid Subah with delight and in a state of
happiness. On the 11th of Mihr, Jagat Singh, son of Kunwar Karan, came
from his native place and waited on me. On the 16th, M&#299;rz&#257;
&#703;Al&#299; Beg Akbars&#863;h&#257;h&#299; came from the province of
Oudh, which had been given him in jagir, and waited on me. He presented
as offerings 1,000 rupees, and he produced before me an elephant which
one of the zamindars of that province possessed, and which he had been
ordered to take from him. On the 21st the offering of Qutbu-l-mulk, the
ruler of Golcondah, consisting of some jewelled ornaments, was
inspected by me. The mansab of Sayyid Q&#257;sim B&#257;rha was fixed,
original and increase, at 1,000 personal and 600 horse. On the eve of
Friday, the 22nd, M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Al&#299; Beg, whose age had

left neither son nor other descendants. He had the poetic temperament.
As his inevitable destiny had been fulfilled<a class="noteref" id=

on which he went to pay his devotions at the venerated mausoleum of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Mu&#703;&#299;nu-d-d&#299;n, I ordered them to bury
him in the same blessed place.</p>
<p class="par">At the time when I gave leave to the ambassadors of
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n of Bijapur, I had requested that if in
that province there were a wrestler, or a celebrated swordsman, they
should tell &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n to send him to me. After
some time, when the ambassadors returned, they brought a Mughal, by
name S&#863;h&#299;r &#703;Al&#299;, who was born at Bijapur, and was a
wrestler by profession and had great experience in the art, together
with certain sword-players. The performances of the latter were
indifferent, but I put S&#863;h&#299;r &#703;Al&#299; to wrestle with
the wrestlers and athletes who were in attendance on me, and they could
none of them compete with him. One thousand rupees, a dress of honour,
and an elephant were conferred on him; he was exceedingly well made,
well shaped, and powerful. I retained him in my own service, and
entitled him &ldquo;the athlete of the capital.&rdquo; A jagir and
mansab were given him and great favours bestowed on him. On the 24th,
Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been appointed to bring
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n Bah&#257;dur F&#299;r&#363;z-jang,
brought him and waited on me, and presented as an offering 100 muhrs.
On the same date R&#257;m D&#257;s, the son of R&#257;ja R&#257;j
Singh, one of the Rajput Amirs who had died on duty in the Deccan, was
promoted to a mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. As
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n had been guilty of faults, he made
B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram his intercessor, and on the 26th, in order
to please him, I ordered the former <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb336" href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span>to pay his respects
to me. He waited upon me with a face of complete shame, and presented
as offerings 100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees. Before the coming of
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s ambassadors I had made up my
mind that, having sent B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram with the vanguard,
I should myself proceed to the Deccan and carry out this important
affair, which for some reasons had been put off. For this reason I had
given an order that except the prince no one should represent to me the
affairs of the rulers of the Deccan. On this day the prince brought the
ambassadors and laid their representation before me. After the death of
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, R&#257;ja M&#257;n and many of the
auxiliary Sardars had come to Court. On this day, at the request of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, I appointed R&#257;ja M&#257;n as the
leader in the attack on the fort of K&#257;ng&#7771;a. I appointed all
the men to accompany him, and according to the condition and rank of
each made him happy with a present&mdash;a horse, an elephant, a robe
of honour, or money&mdash;and gave them leave. After some days I
conferred on &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, at the request of
B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram, a jewelled dagger, as he was exceedingly
broken-hearted and grieved in mind, and an order was passed that his
mansab should continue as it was before, and that he should remain in
attendance on my son among those appointed for duty in the Deccan. On
the 3rd &#256;b&#257;n I ordered the mansab of Waz&#299;r
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was in attendance on B&#257;b&#257; Parwiz, to be,
original and increase, 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 4th,
K&#863;husrau, who was in the charge, for safe keeping, of
An&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299; Singh-dalan, for certain considerations was
handed over to &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n. I presented him with a
special shawl. On the 7th (&#256;b&#257;n), corresponding with the 17th
S&#863;haww&#257;l (28th October, 1616), a person of the name of
Muh&#803;ammad Riz&#803;&#257; Beg, whom the ruler of Persia had sent
as his representative, paid his respects. After performing the dues of
prostration and salutation (<i>k&#363;rnis&#863;h, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span>sijda, tasl&#299;m</i>), he laid before me the
letter he had brought. It was decided that he should produce before me
the horses and other presents he had brought with him. The written and
verbal messages sent were full of friendship, brotherhood, and
sincerity. I gave the ambassador on that same day a jewelled tiara
(<i>t&#257;j</i>) and a dress of honour. As in the letter much
friendliness and affection were displayed, an exact copy is recorded in
the Jah&#257;ng&#299;r-n&#257;ma.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7301src"

<p class="par">On Sunday, the 18th S&#863;haww&#257;l, corresponding to

B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram left Ajmir for the purpose of the conquest
of the provinces of the Deccan, and it was decided that my son
aforesaid should start by way of advanced guard, followed by the
glorious standards (of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r). On Monday, the 19th,
corresponding with the 9th &#256;b&#257;n, when three gharis of day had
passed, the auspicious palace moved in the same direction in the like
manner. On the 10th the mansab of R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Mal, who had
been appointed to accompany the prince, was made up, original and
increase, to 2,000 personal and horse. On the night of the 19th
&#256;b&#257;n, after my usual custom, I was in the
<i>g&#863;husul-k&#863;h&#257;na</i>. Some of the Amirs and attendants,
and by chance Muh&#803;ammad Riz&#803;&#257; Beg, the ambassador of the
ruler of Persia, were present. When six gharis had passed, an owl came
and sat on top of a high terrace roof belonging to the palace, and was
hardly visible, so that many men failed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb338" href="#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>to distinguish it. I
sent for a gun and took aim and fired in the direction that they
pointed out to me. The gun, like the decree of heaven, fell on that
ill-omened bird and blew it to pieces. A shout arose from those who
were present, and involuntarily they opened their lips in applause and
praise. On the same night I talked with the ambassador of my brother
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s, and at last the conversation turned
on the slaying of &#7778;af&#299; M&#299;rz&#257;, his (the
Shah&rsquo;s) eldest son. I asked him because this was a difficulty in
my mind. He represented that if his slaughter had not been carried out
at that time he would certainly have attempted the Shah&rsquo;s life.
As this intention became manifest from his behaviour, the Shah was
beforehand with him and ordered him to be killed. On the same day the
mansab of M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;asan, son of M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam,
was fixed, original and increase, at 1,000 personal and 300 horse. The
mansab of Mu&#703;tamad K&#863;h&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7320src" href="#xd24e7320" name="xd24e7320src">39</a> who had
been appointed to the post of paymaster of the army with B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram, was settled at 1,000 personal and 250 horse. The time
for the leave-taking of B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram had been fixed as
Friday, the 20th (&#256;b&#257;n). At the end of this day he paraded
before me the pick of his men armed and ready in the public hall of
audience. Of the distinguished favours bestowed on the aforesaid son
one was the title of S&#863;h&#257;h, which was made a part of his
name. I ordered that thereafter he should be styled S&#863;h&#257;h
Sult&#804;&#257;n K&#863;hurram. I presented him with a robe of honour,
a jewelled <i>ch&#257;rqab</i>, the fringe and collar of which were
decorated with pearls, an Iraq horse with a jewelled saddle, a Turki
horse, a special elephant called Bans&#299;-badan,<a class="noteref"

<i>pardala</i> (sword-belt) that had been taken at the conquest of the
fort of Ahmadnagar and was very celebrated, and a jewelled dagger. He
started with great keenness. My trust in Almighty God is that in this
service he may gain renown (lit. become red-faced). On each of the
Amirs and mansabdars, according to his quality and degree, a horse and
an elephant were conferred. Loosening a private sword from my own
waist, I gave it to &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
F&#299;r&#363;z-jang. As Day&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n had been
appointed to accompany the prince, I gave the duty of
<i>&#703;arz&#803;-mukarrir</i> (reviser of petitions) to
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Q&#257;sim Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n.
Previously<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7341src" href="#xd24e7341" name=

certain sum of money from the royal treasury in the
<i>kotw&#257;l&#299; chab&#363;tara</i> (Police Office). After some
days seven men of that band, with their leader, of the name of Nawal,
were caught, and a portion of that money was recovered. It occurred to
me that as they had been guilty of such boldness I ought to punish them
severely. Each was punished in exemplary fashion, and I ordered Nawal,
the leader of them all, to be thrown under the feet of an elephant. He
petitioned that if I would give the order he would fight the elephant.
I ordered it to be so. They produced a very furious elephant. I bade
them put a dagger into his hand and bring him in front of the elephant.
The elephant several times threw him down, and each time that violent
and fearless man, although he witnessed the punishments of his
comrades, got up again and bravely and with a stout heart struck the
elephant&rsquo;s trunk with the dagger, so that the animal refrained
from attacking him. When I had witnessed this pluck and manliness, I
ordered them to inquire into his history. After a short time, according
to his evil nature and low disposition, he ran away in his longing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=

greatly, and I ordered the jagirdars of that neighbourhood to hunt him
up and apprehend him. By chance he was caught a second time, and this
time I ordered that ungrateful and unappreciative one to be hanged. The
saying of S&#863;haik&#863;h Mu&#7779;lih&#803;u-d-d&#299;n

its embankment is broken. At this time I ordered it to be repaired. The

was always full of water and waves. This <i>t&#257;l</i> is 1&frac12;

the revered K&#863;hw&#257;ja, and fifteen times went to look at the
Pushkar lake; to the Chashma-i-N&#363;r I went thirty-eight times. I
went out to hunt tigers, etc., fifty times. I killed 15 tigers, 1
cheetah, 1 black-ear (lynx), 53 nilgaw, 33 gazelle (<i>gawazn</i>), 90
antelope, 80 boars, and 340 water-fowl. I encamped seven times at Deo
R&#257;y (Deo R&#257;n&#299;) (Dor&#257;&#299;?). At this halt 5 nilgaw
and 12 water-fowl were killed. Marching on the 29th from Deo R&#257;y,
my camp was pitched at the village of D&#257;s&#257;wal&#299;, 2 kos
and 1&frac12; quarters distant from Deo R&#257;y. On this day I gave an
elephant to Mu&#703;tamad K&#863;h&#257;n. I stayed the next day at
this village. On this day a nilgaw was killed, and I sent two of my
falcons to my son K&#863;hurram. I marched from this village on the

of B&#257;dhal (M&#257;wal?), 2&frac14; kos distant. On the road six
water-fowl, etc., were killed. On the 4th, having gone 1&frac12; kos,
R&#257;msar,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7411src" href="#xd24e7411"
name="xd24e7411src">49</a> which belongs to N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam,
became the place for the alighting of honour and glory. A halt was made
at this place for eight days. In the place of K&#863;hidmat-g&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n I here appointed Hid&#257;yatu-llah
<i>m&#299;r-t&#363;zak</i> (master of ceremonies). On the 5th day 7
antelope, 1 kulang (crane), and 15 fish were killed. The next day Jagat
Singh, son of Kunwar Karan, received a horse and a robe of honour and
took leave for his native place. A horse was also given to Kes&#863;ho
D&#257;s L&#257;l&#257; and an elephant to Allah-d&#257;d
K&#863;h&#257;n Afg&#863;han. On the same day I killed a gazelle, 3
antelope, 7 fish, and 2 water-fowl. On that day was heard the news of
the death of R&#257;ja Sy&#257;m Singh, who belonged to the army of
Bangash. On the 7th day 3 antelope, 5 water-fowl, and a
<i>qas&#863;hqald&#257;g&#863;h</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e7420src"

Thursday and the eve of Friday, as R&#257;msar belongs to the jagir of
N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n, a feast and entertainment were prepared. Jewels,
jewelled ornaments, fine cloths, sewn tapestry, and every kind of
jewellery were presented as offerings. At night on all sides and in the
middle of the lake, which is very broad, lamps were displayed. An
excellent entertainment was arranged. In the end of the said Thursday,
having also sent for the Amirs, I ordered cups for most<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7432src" href="#xd24e7432" name=
"xd24e7432src">51</a> of the servants. On my journeys by land some
boats are always taken along with the victorious camp; the boatmen
convey them on carts. On the day after this entertainment I went to
fish in these boats, and in a short time 208 large fish came into one
net. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=

<i>rak&#363;</i>. At night I divided them among the servants in my own
presence. On the 13th &#256;z&#817;ar I marched from R&#257;msar, and
hunting for 4 kos along the road, the camp was pitched at the village
of Balod&#257;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7440src" href="#xd24e7440"

On this day I gave an elephant to Muh&#803;ammad Riz&#803;&#257; Beg,
ambassador of the ruler of Persia. The village of Jons&#257; became the
halting-place of the tents of greatness and prosperity. On the 20th I
marched to the halting-place of Deog&#257;on; I hunted along the road
for a distance of 3 kos. I stayed at this place for two days, and at
the end of the day went out to hunt. At this stage a strange affair was
witnessed. Before the royal standards arrived at this halting-place, an
eunuch went to the bank of a large tank there is in the village, and
caught two young <i>s&#257;ras</i>, which are a kind of crane; at
night, when we stopped at this halting-place, two large saras appeared
making loud cries near the ghusul-khana (parlour), which they had
placed on the edge of the tank, as if somebody were exercising
oppression on them. They fearlessly began their cries and came forward.
It occurred to me that certainly some kind of wrong had been done to
them, and probably their young had been taken. After enquiry was made
the eunuch who had taken the young saras brought them before me. When
the saras heard the cries of these young ones, they without control
threw themselves upon them, and suspecting that they had had no food,
each of the two saras placed food in the mouths of the young ones, and
made much lamentation. Taking the two young ones between them, and
stretching out their wings and fondling them, they went off to their
nest. Marching on the 23rd 3&frac34; kos, I alighted at the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span>village of Bah&#257;s&#363; (Bh&#257;l&#363;?).
Here there was a halt of two days, and each day I rode to hunt. On the
26th the royal standards moved and the halt was outside of the village
of K&#257;kal. A halt was made after traversing 2 kos. On the 27th the
mansab of Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, son of M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, original and increased, was fixed at 1,500
personal and 750 horse. Marching on the 29th 2&frac34; kos, a halt was
made at the village of L&#257;s&#257;, near parganah Boda.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7452src" href="#xd24e7452" name=
"xd24e7452src">54</a> This day corresponded with the festival of
Qurb&#257;n (19th December, 1616). I ordered them to observe the
ordinances of that day. From the date on which I left Ajmir up to the
end of the aforesaid month, viz. the 30th &#256;z&#817;ar, 67 nilgaw,
antelope, etc., and 37 water-fowl etc., had been killed. A march was
made from L&#257;s&#257; on the 2nd Day, and I marched and hunted for 3
kos 10 <i>jar&#299;b</i>, and halted in the neighbourhood of the
village of K&#257;n&#7771;&#257;. On the 4th a march of 3&frac14; kos
was made to the village of S&#363;ra&#7789;h. Marching 4&frac12; kos on
the 6th, a halt was made near the village of Barora
(Barda&#7771;&#257;?). On the 7th, when there was a halt, 50 water-fowl
and 14 qashqaldagh (coot) were killed. The next day was a halt as well.
On this day 27 water-fowl became a prey. On the 9th a march of 4&#8539;
kos was made. Hunting and overthrowing prey, I alighted at the
halting-place of K&#863;h&#363;s&#863;h T&#257;l. At this stage a
report came from Mu&#703;tamad K&#863;h&#257;n that when the territory
of the R&#257;n&#257; became the halting-place of S&#863;h&#257;h
K&#863;hurram, though there had been no agreement to this effect (i.e.
to the R&#257;n&#257;&rsquo;s meeting him), the fame and dignity of the
victorious army had introduced a commotion into the pillars of his
patience and firmness, and he had come and paid his respects to him
when he halted at D&#363;dp&#363;r,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7458src"
href="#xd24e7458" name="xd24e7458src">55</a> which was on the border of
his jagir, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>and observing all the dues and ceremonies of
service he had neglected not the smallest portion of them.
S&#863;h&#257;h K&#863;hurram had paid him every attention, and pleased
him with the gift of a dress of honour, a <i>ch&#257;rqab</i>, a
jewelled sword, a jewelled khapwa, Persian and Turki horses, and an
elephant, and dismissed him with every honour. He had also favoured his
sons and relations with dresses of honour, and out of his offering,
which consisted of five elephants, twenty-seven horses, and a tray full
of jewels and jewelled ornaments, had taken three horses and given back
the remainder. It was settled that his son Karan should attend on the
stirrup of B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram in this expedition with 1,500
horse. On the 10th the sons of R&#257;ja Mah&#257; Singh came from
their jagir and native place (Amber) and waited on me in the
neighbourhood of Ran&#7789;ambhor, making an offering of three
elephants and nine horses. Each one of them, according to his
condition, received an increase of mansab. As the neighbourhood of the
said fort became a halting-place for the royal standards, I released
some of the prisoners who were confined in that fort. At this place I
halted for two days and each day went to hunt. Thirty-eight water-fowl
and qashqaldagh (coot) were taken. On the 12th I marched, and after
going 4 kos halted at the village of Koyal&#257;. On the road I killed
fourteen water-fowl and an antelope. On the 14th, having traversed
3&frac34; kos, I halted in the neighbourhood of the village of
Ek&#7789;or&#257;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7467src" href=
"#xd24e7467" name="xd24e7467src">56</a> killing on the road a blue
bull, twelve herons (<i>karw&#257;nak</i>), etc. On the same day
&#256;g&#863;h&#257; F&#257;z&#803;il, who had been appointed deputy
for I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah at Lahore, was dignified with the title
of F&#257;z&#803;il K&#863;h&#257;n. At this stage they had erected the
royal lodging (<i>daulat-k&#863;h&#257;na</i>) on the bank of a tank,
which was exceedingly bright and pleasant. On account of the
pleasantness of the place <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href=
"#pb346" name="pb346">346</a>]</span>I halted two days there, and at
the end of each went to hunt water-fowl. To this place the younger son
of Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n, by name Bahra-war, came from the fort
of Ran&#7789;ambhor, which is his father&rsquo;s jagir, to pay his
respects to me. He had brought two elephants, both of which were
included in my private stud. I promoted &#7778;af&#299;, son of
Am&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n, to the title of K&#863;h&#257;n, and,
increasing his mansab, made him bakhshi and news-writer of the Subah of
Gujarat. Having travelled 4&frac12; kos on the 17th, I halted at the
village of Las&#257;y&#257;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7479src" href=
"#xd24e7479" name="xd24e7479src">57</a> During the halt I killed one
water-fowl and twenty-three sand-grouse (<i>durr&#257;j</i>). As I had
sent for Las&#863;hkar K&#863;h&#257;n to Court on account of the
disagreement that had occurred between him and K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n, I at this place appointed &#703;&#256;bid

the 19th, having made a march of 2&frac14; kos, an encampment was made
in the neighbourhood of the village of K&#363;r&#257;ka

"#xd24e7488" name="xd24e7488src">59</a> which is situated on the bank
of the Chambal. On account of the excellence of the place and the
pleasantness of its air and water, a halt took place here for three
days. Every day I sat in a boat and went to hunt water-fowl and to
wander over the river. On the 22nd<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7494src"
href="#xd24e7494" name="xd24e7494src">60</a> there was a march, and
having traversed 4&frac12; kos, shooting on the road, the victorious
camp was pitched at the villages of Sult&#804;&#257;np&#363;r and
Ch&#299;la Mala (Ch&#299;l&#257;m&#299;l&#257;?). On this day of halt I
bestowed on M&#299;r&#257;n &#7778;adr Jah&#257;n 5,000 rupees, and
gave him leave to proceed to the place assigned to him as his jagir.
Another 1,000 rupees were given to S&#863;haik&#863;h P&#299;r. On the
25th I marched and hunted for 3&frac12; kos and encamped at the village
of B&#257;s&#363;r.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7497src" href=

halt and one march took place, and on the 27th I marched and hunted

(Varadh&#257;?). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347"
name="pb347">347</a>]</span>Two days halt took place here. In this
month of Day 416 animals were killed, namely, 97 sand-grouse (durraj),
192 qashqaldagh, 1 saras, 7 herons, 118 water-fowl, and 1 hare. On the
1st Bahman, corresponding with the 12th Muharram, 1026 (20th January,
1617), seating myself in boats with the ladies, I went forward one
stage. When one ghari of day remained I arrived at the village of
R&#363;p&#257;he&#7771;&#257;, the halting-place, the distance being 4
kos and 15 jarib. I shot five sand-grouse. On the same day I sent by
the hands of Kaikana winter dresses of honour to twenty-one Amirs on
duty in the Deccan, and ordered him to take 10,000<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e7503src" href="#xd24e7503" name="xd24e7503src">62</a> rupees
from those Amirs as a thanksgiving for the dresses of honour. This
halting-place had much verdure and pleasantness. On the 3rd a march
took place. As on the previous day, I embarked in a boat, and after
traversing 2&#8539; kos the village of K&#257;kh&#257;-d&#257;s
(K&#257;kh&#257;v&#257;s?)<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7506src" href=
"#xd24e7506" name="xd24e7506src">63</a> became the encamping place of
the victorious camp. As I came hunting on the way, a sand-grouse fell
flying into a thicket. After much search it was marked, and I ordered
one of the beaters to surround the thicket and catch it, and went
towards it myself. Meanwhile another sand-grouse rose, and this I made
a falcon seize. Soon afterwards the beater came and laid the
sand-grouse before me. I ordered them to satisfy the falcon with this
sand-grouse, and to keep the one we had caught, as it was a young bird.
(But) before the order reached him the head huntsman fed the falcon
with the sand-grouse (the second one, viz. that which the falcon had
caught). After a while the beater represented to me that if he did not
kill the sand-grouse it would die (and then could not be eaten as not
properly killed). I ordered him to kill it if that was the case. As he
laid his sword on its throat, it with a slight movement freed itself
from the sword and flew away. After I had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb348" href="#pb348" name="pb348">348</a>]</span>left the boat and
mounted my horse, suddenly a sparrow (<i>kunjis&#863;hk</i>) by the
force of the wind struck the head of an arrow that one of the beaters
who was in my retinue had in his hand, and immediately fell down and
died. I was amazed and bewildered at the tricks of destiny; on one side
it preserved the sand-grouse, whose time had not arrived, in a short
time from three such dangers, and on the other hand made captive in the
hand of destruction on the arrow of fate the sparrow whose hour of
death had come&mdash;</p>

<p class="par first">Dresses of honour for the winter had also been
sent by the hand of Qar&#257;, the <i>yas&#257;wul</i> (usher), to the
Amirs at Kabul. I halted at this place on account of the pleasantness
of the spot and the excellence of the air. On this day there came the
news of the death of N&#257;d &#703;Al&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n
Maid&#257;ni at Kabul. I honoured his sons with mansabs, and at the
request of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n

R&#257;wat S&#863;hankar by 500 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 6th
there was a march, and going for 4&#8539; kos by the pass known as
Gh&#257;&#7789;e Ch&#257;nd&#257;, the royal camp was pitched at the
village of Amh&#803;&#257;r (Amj&#257;r?). This valley is very green
and pleasant and good trees are seen in it. Up to this stage, which is
the limit of the country of the Subah of Ajmir, 84 kos had been
traversed. It was also a pleasant stage. N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam here
shot with a gun a <i>qar&#299;s&#863;ha</i>(?), the like of which for
size and beauty of colour had never been seen. I ordered them to weigh
it, and it came to 19 tolas and 5 mashas. The aforesaid village is the
commencement of the Subah of Malwa, which is in the second clime. The
length<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7530src" href="#xd24e7530" name=

of Ga&#7771;ha to the province of B&#257;nsw&#257;la
(B&#257;nswa&#7771;&#257;?) is 245 kos, and its <span class=

the parganah of Nandarb&#257;r is 230 kos. On the east is the province
of B&#257;ndho, and on the north the fort of Narwar, on the south the
province of Bagl&#257;n&#257;, and on the west the Subahs of Gujarat
and Ajmir. Malwa is a large province abounding in water and of a
pleasant climate. There are five rivers in it in addition to streams,
canals, and springs, namely, the Godavar&#299;,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7536src" href="#xd24e7536" name="xd24e7536src">66</a>
Bh&#299;m&#257;, K&#257;l&#299;sindh, N&#299;r&#257;, and Narbada. Its
climate is nearly equable. The land of this province is low, but part
of it is high. In the district of Dh&#257;r, which is one of the noted
places of Malwa, the vine gives grapes twice in the year, in the
beginning of Pisces and the beginning of Leo, but the grapes of Pisces
are the sweeter. Its husbandmen and artificers are not without arms.
The revenue of the province is 24,700,000 dams. When needful there are
obtained from it about 9,300<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7539src" href=
"#xd24e7539" name="xd24e7539src">67</a> horse and four lakhs, 70,300
foot-soldiers, with 100 elephants. On the 8th, moving on 3&frac12; kos,
an encampment was made near K&#863;hair&#257;b&#257;d. On the road 14
sand-grouse and 3 herons were killed, and having traversed and shot
over 3 kos the camp was pitched at the village of Sidh&#257;r&#257;. On
the 11th, while there was a halt, I mounted at the end of the day to
hunt, and killed a blue bull. On the 12th, after traversing 4&frac14;
kos, a halt was made at the village of Bachhay&#257;r&#299;. On that
day R&#257;n&#257; Amar Singh had sent some baskets of figs. In truth
it is a fine fruit, and I had never seen such delicious figs in India.
But one must eat only a few of them; it does harm to eat many. On the
14th there was a march; having traversed 4&#8539; kos, I encamped at
the village of Balbal&#299;. R&#257;ja J&#257;nb&#257; who is an
influential zamindar in these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350"
href="#pb350" name="pb350">350</a>]</span>regions, had sent two
elephants as an offering, and they were brought before me. At the same
stage they brought many melons grown in K&#257;r&#299;z near Herat.
K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam had also sent 50 camels. In former
years they had never brought melons in such abundance. On one tray they
brought many kinds of fruit&mdash;K&#257;r&#299;z melons, melons from
Badakhshan and Kabul, grapes from Samarkand<a class="noteref" id=

Badakhshan, apples from Samarkand, Kashmir, Kabul, and from Jalalabad,
which is a dependency of Kabul, and pineapples, a fruit that comes from
the European ports, plants of which have been set in Agra. Every year
some thousands are gathered in the gardens there which appertain to the
private domains
(<i>k&#863;h&#257;li&#7779;a-i-s&#863;har&#299;fa</i>)<a class=

similar in form to an orange, but smaller and better in flavour. They
grow very well in the Subah of Bengal. In what language can one give
thanks for such favours? My revered father had a great liking for
fruit, especially for melons, pomegranates, and grapes. During his time
the K&#257;r&#299;z melons, which are the finest kind, and pomegranates
from Yezd, which are celebrated throughout the world and Samarkand
grapes had not been brought to Hindustan. Whenever I see these fruits
they cause me great regret. Would that such fruit had come in those
days, so that he might have enjoyed them!</p>

Timurides). On the 16th a march took place. Having traversed 4&#8539;
kos, the camp of heavenly dignity was pitched near the village of
Gir&#299;. On the road the scouts brought news that there was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=
"pb351">351</a>]</span>a lion in this neighbourhood. I went to hunt him
and finished him with one shot. As the braveness of the lion
(<i>sh&#299;r babar</i>) has been established, I wished to look at his
intestines. After they were extracted, it appeared that in a manner
contrary to other animals, whose gall-bladder is outside their livers,
the gall-bladder of the lion is within his liver(?). It occurred to me
that the courage of the lion may be from this cause. On the 18th, after
traversing 2&frac34; kos, the village of Amriy&#257; was our
halting-place. On the 19th, which was a halt, I went out to hunt. After
going 2 kos, a village came to view exceedingly sweet and pleasant.
Nearly 100 mango-trees were seen in one garden; I had seldom seen
mango-trees so large and green and pleasant. In the same garden I saw a
<i>bar</i>-tree (a banyan), exceedingly large. I ordered them to
measure its length, breadth, and height in yards (<i>gaz</i>). Its
height from the surface to the highest branch
(<i>sar-s&#863;h&#257;k&#863;h</i>) was 74 cubits
(<i>z&#804;ira&#703;</i>). The circumference of its trunk was
44&frac12; cubits and its breadth<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7598src"
href="#xd24e7598" name="xd24e7598src">71</a> 175&frac12; measured by
the gaz. This has been recorded as it is very unusual. On the 20th was
a march, and on the road a blue bull was shot with a gun. On the 21st,
which was a halt, I went out to hunt at the end of the day. After
returning, I came to the house of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah for the
festival of K&#863;hw&#257;ja K&#863;hiz&#803;r, whom they call
K&#863;hiz&#803;r&#299;; I remained there till a watch of the night had
passed, and then feeling inclined for food I went back to the royal
quarters. On this day I honoured I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah as an
intimate friend by directing the ladies of the harem not to veil their
faces from him. By this favour I bestowed everlasting honour on him. On
the 22nd an order was given to march, and after 3&#8539; kos were
traversed the camp was pitched at the village of B&#363;lghar&#299;
(Nawalkhe&#7771;&#299;?). On the road two blue <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352</a>]</span>bulls were killed. On the 23rd day of T&#299;r,
which was a halt, I killed a blue bull with a gun. On the 24th,
traversing 5 kos, the village of Q&#257;sim-khe&#7771;&#257; was the
halting-place. On the road a white animal<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7605src" href="#xd24e7605" name="xd24e7605src">72</a> was killed,
which resembled the <i>k&#363;t&#257;h p&#257;ya</i> (hog-deer); it had
four horns, two of which were opposite the extremities of its eyes, and
two finger-breadths in height, and the two other horns four
finger-breadths towards the nape of the neck. These were four
finger-breadths in height. The people of India call this animal
<i>d&#363;dh&#257;dh&#257;r&#299;t</i> (<i>dudh&#257;riy&#257;</i>?).
The male has four horns and the female none. It was said that this kind
of antelope has no gall-bladder, but when they looked at its intestines
the gall-bladder was apparent, and it became clear that this report has
no foundation. On the 25th, which was a halt, at the end of the day I
rode out to hunt and killed a female nilgaw with my gun.
B&#257;lj&#363;, nephew of Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, who held the
mansab of 1,000 personal and 850 horse, and had a jagir in Oudh, I
promoted to 2,000 personal and 1,200 horse, dignified him with the
title of Qil&#299;j K&#863;h&#257;n, and appointed him to the Subah of
Bengal. On the 26th a march took place, and after traversing 4&frac34;
kos a halt was made at the village of Dih Q&#257;z&#803;iy&#257;n,
which is in the neighbourhood of Ujjain. A number of mango-trees in
this place had blossomed. They had pitched the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name=
"pb353">353</a>]</span>tents on the bank of a lake, and had prepared an
enchanting place. Pah&#257;&#7771;, son of G&#863;hazn&#299;n<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7651src" href="#xd24e7651" name=
"xd24e7651src">73</a> K&#863;h&#257;n, was capitally punished at this
stage. Cherishing this unlucky one after the death of his father, I had
given him the fort and province of J&#257;laur, which was the place of
his ancestors. As he was of tender years, his mother used to forbid him
certain evil practices. That eternally black-faced one with some of his
companions one night came into the house and killed his own full mother
with his own hand. This news reached me and I ordered them to bring
him. After his crime was proved against him, I ordered them to put him
to death (<i>kih ba biy&#257;s&#257; ras&#257;n&#299;dand</i>). At this
halting-place a tamarind<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7657src" href=
"#xd24e7657" name="xd24e7657src">74</a>-tree came to view, the form and
habit of which were somewhat strange. The original tree had one trunk;
when it had grown to 6 gaz, it turned into two branches, one of which
was 10 and the other 9&frac12; gaz. The distance between the two
branches was 4&frac12; gaz. From the ground to the place where the
branches and leaves came to an end(?), there were on the side of the
large branch 16 gaz, and on the other branch 15&frac12; gaz. From the
place whence the branches and green leaves began(?) to the top (trunk?)
of the tree was 2&frac12; gaz, and the circumference was 2&frac34; gaz.
I ordered them to make a <i>chab&#363;tara</i> (platform) round it of
the height of 3 gaz. As the trunk was very straight and well-shaped, I
told my artists to depict it in the illustrations to the
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r-n&#257;ma. A march was made on the 27th. After
traversing 2&#8539; kos, a halt was made <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb354" href="#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span>at the village of
Hinduw&#257;l<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7678src" href="#xd24e7678"
name="xd24e7678src">75</a>; on the road a blue bull was killed. On the
28th, after traversing 2 kos, the village of K&#257;liy&#257;daha
became the halting-place. K&#257;liy&#257;daha is a building which was
made by N&#257;siru-d-d&#299;n, son of
G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n, son of Sult&#804;&#257;n
Mah&#803;m&#363;d K&#863;halj&#299;, who was ruler of Malwa. In the
time of his rule he had made it in the neighbourhood of Ujjain, which
is one of the most celebrated cities in the Subah of Malwa. They say
that the heat overcame him so much that he passed his time in the
water. He made this building in the middle of the river, and divided
its waters into canals, and brought the water on all sides, as well as
inside and outside, of the house, and made large and small reservoirs
suited to the place. It is a very pleasant and enjoyable place, and one
of the noted habitations of Hindustan. Before it was decided to halt at
this place I sent architects and ordered them to clean up the place
again. On account of its pleasantness I remained in this place for
three days. At the same place S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n
came from his jagir and waited on me. Ujjain is one of the old cities,
and is one of the seven established places of worship of the Hindus.
R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, who introduced the observation of the
heavens and stars into Hindustan, lived in this city and province. From
the time of his observations until now, which is the 1026th Hijra year
(1617 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>) and the 11th year from my
accession, 1,675<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7684src" href="#xd24e7684"
name="xd24e7684src">76</a> years have passed. The deductions of the
astronomers of India are all based on his observations. This city is on
the bank of the River Sipra. The belief<a class="noteref" id=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=

time the water of this river turns into milk. In the reign of my
revered father, at the time when he had sent Ab&#363;-l-faz&#803;l to
set in order the affairs of my brother S&#863;h&#257;h Mur&#257;d, he
sent a report from that city that a large body of Hindus and Musulmans
had borne testimony that some days previously at night this river had
become milk, so that people who took water from it that night found in
the morning their pots full of milk.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7693src" href="#xd24e7693" name="xd24e7693src">78</a> As this
obtained currency it has been recorded, but my intelligence will in no
way agree to it. The real truth of this affair is known to Allah. On
the 2nd Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817; I embarked in a boat from
K&#257;liy&#257;daha, and went to the next stage. I had frequently
heard that an austere Sany&#257;s&#299;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7696src" href="#xd24e7696" name="xd24e7696src">79</a> of the name
of Jadr&#363;p many years ago retired from the city of Ujjain to a
corner of the desert and employed himself in the worship of the true
God. I had a great desire for his acquaintance, and when I was at the
capital of Agra I was desirous of sending for and seeing him. In the
end, thinking of the trouble it would give him, I did not send for him.
When I arrived in the neighbourhood of the city I alighted from the
boat and went &#8539; kos on foot to see him. The place he had chosen
to live in was a hole on the side of a hill which had been dug out and
a door made. At the entrance there is an opening in the shape of a
<i>mih&#803;r&#257;b</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7703src" href=
"#xd24e7703" name="xd24e7703src">80</a> which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name="pb356">356</a>]</span>is
in length (? height) 1 gaz and in breadth 10 <i>gira</i>, (knots, each
&#8203;1&frasl;16&#8203; of a gaz), and the distance from this door to
a hole which is his real abode is 2 gaz and 5 knots in length and in
breadth 11&frac14; knots. The height from the ground to the roof is 1
gaz and 3 knots. The hole whence is the entrance to the abode is in
length 5&frac12; knots and its breadth 3&frac12; knots. A person of
weak body (thin?) can only enter it with a hundred difficulties. The
length and breadth of the hole are such. It has no mat and no straw. In
this narrow and dark hole he passes his time in solitude. In the cold
days of winter, though he is quite naked, with the exception of a piece
of rag that he has in front and behind, he never lights a fire. The
Mulla of R&#363;m (Jal&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n) has put into rhyme the
language of a dervish&mdash;</p>

<p class="par first">He bathes twice a day in a piece of water near his
abode, and once a day goes into the city of Ujjain, and nowhere but to
the houses of three brahmins whom he has selected out of seven, who
have wives and children and whom he believes to have religious feelings
and contentment. He takes by way of alms five mouthfuls of food out of
what they have prepared for their own eating, which he swallows without
chewing, in order that he may not enjoy their flavour; always provided
that no misfortune has happened to their three houses, that there has
been no birth, and there be no menstruous woman in the house. This is
his method of living, just as it is now written. He does not desire to
associate with men, but as he has obtained great notoriety people go to
see him. He is not devoid of knowledge, for he has thoroughly mastered
the science of the Ved&#257;nta, which is the science of Sufism. I
conversed with him for six gharis; he spoke well, so much so as to make
a great impression on me. My society also suited him. <span class=

<p class="par">The learned of India have established four modes of life
for the caste of brahmins, which is the most honoured of the castes of
Hindus, and have divided their lives into four periods. These four
periods they call the four <i>&#257;sram</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7736src" href="#xd24e7736" name="xd24e7736src">81</a> The boy who
is born in a brahmin&rsquo;s house they do not call brahmin till he is
7 years old, and take no trouble on the subject. After he has arrived
at the age of 8 years, they have a meeting and collect the brahmins
together. They make a cord of <i>m&#363;nj</i> grass, which they call
<i>m&#363;nj&#299;</i>, in length 2&frac14; gaz, and having caused
prayers and incantations to be repeated over it, and having had it made
into three strands, which they call <i>sih tan</i>, by one in whom they
have confidence, they fasten it on his waist. Having woven a
<i>zunn&#257;r</i> (girdle or thread) out of the loose threads, they
hang it over his right<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7752src" href=
"#xd24e7752" name="xd24e7752src">82</a> shoulder. Having given into his
hand a stick of the length of a little over 1 gaz to defend himself
with from hurtful things and a copper vessel for drinking-water, they
hand him over to a learned brahmin that he may remain in his house for
twelve years, and employ himself in reading the Vedas, which they
believe in as God&rsquo;s book. From this day forward they call him a
brahmin. During this time it is necessary that he should altogether
abstain from bodily pleasures. When midday is passed he goes as a
beggar to the houses of other brahmins, and bringing what is given him
to his preceptor, eats it with his permission. For clothing, with the
exception of a loin cloth (<i>lung&#299;</i>) of cotton to cover his
private parts, and 2 or 3 more gaz of cotton <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=
"pb358">358</a>]</span>which he throws over his back, he has nothing
else. This state is called <i>brahmacharya</i>, that is, being busied
with the Divine books. After this period has passed, with the leave of
his preceptor and his father, he marries, and is allowed to enjoy all
the pleasures of his five senses until the time when he has a son who
shall have attained the age of 16 years. If he does not have a son, he
passes his days till he is 48 in the social life. During this time they
call him a <i>grihast</i>, that is, householder. After that time,
separating himself from relatives, connections, strangers, and friends,
and giving up all things of enjoyment and pleasure, he retires to a
place of solitude from the place of attachment to sociality
(<i>ta&#703;alluq-i-&#257;b&#257;d-i-kas&#804;rat</i>), and passes his
days in the jungle. They call this condition
<i>b&#257;nprasta</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7773src" href=
"#xd24e7773" name="xd24e7773src">83</a> that is, abode in the jungle.
As it is a maxim of the Hindus that no good deed can be thoroughly
performed by men in the social state without the partnership of the
presence of a wife, whom they have styled the half of a man, and as a
portion of the ceremonies and worshippings is yet before him (has to be
accomplished), he takes his wife with him into the jungle. If she
should be pregnant, he puts off his going until she bear a child and it
arrive at the age of 5 years. Then he entrusts the child to his eldest
son or other relation, and carries out his intention. In the same way,
if his wife be menstruous, he puts off going until she is purified.
After this he has no connection with her, and does not defile himself
with communication with her, and at night he sleeps apart.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7776src" href="#xd24e7776" name=
"xd24e7776src">84</a> He passes twelve years in this place, and lives
on vegetables which may have sprung up of themselves in the desert and
jungle. He keeps his zunnar by him and worships fire. He does not waste
his time in looking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359"
name="pb359">359</a>]</span>after his nails or the hair of his head, or
in trimming his beard and moustaches. When he completes this period in
the manner related, he returns to his own house, and having commended
his wife to his children and brothers and sons-in-law, goes to pay his
respects to his spiritual guide, and burns by throwing into the fire in
his presence whatever he has in the way of a zunnar, the hair of his
head, etc., and says to him: &ldquo;Whatever attachment
(<i>ta&#703;alluq</i>) I may have had, even to abstinence and
worshipping and will, I have rooted up out of my heart.&rdquo; Then he
closes the road to his heart and to his desires and is always employed
in contemplation of God, and knows no one except the True Cause of
Being (God). If he speak of science it is the science of Ved&#257;nta,
the purport of which B&#257;b&#257; Fig&#863;h&#257;n&#299; has
versified in this couplet&mdash;</p>

<p class="par">After interviewing Jadr&#363;p I mounted an elephant and

the place where the royal camp was pitched. On the 3rd day, which was a
halting day, I went, from desire for association with him, after
midday, to see Jadr&#363;p, and for six gharis enjoyed myself in his
company. On this day also he uttered good words, and it was near
evening when I entered my palace. On the 4th day I journeyed 3&frac14;

also a very pleasant halting-place, full of trees. On the 6th there was
a march; after proceeding for 4&frac34; kos I halted on the bank of the
lake of Deb&#257;lp&#363;r Bheriy&#257;. On account of the pleasantness
of the place and the delights of the lake, I halted at this stage for
four days, and at the end of each day, embarking in a boat, employed
myself in shooting ducks (<i>murg&#863;h&#257;b&#299;</i>) and other
aquatic animals. At this halting-place they brought
<i>fak&#863;hr&#299;</i> grapes from Ahmadnagar. Although they are not
as large as the Kabul fakhri grapes, they do not yield to them in
sweetness.</p>
<p class="par">At the request of my son B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram
the mansab of Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, son of M&#299;rz&#257;

On the 11th I marched, and after proceeding for 3&frac14; kos halted in
the parganah Daulatabad. On the 12th, which was a halt, I rode out to
hunt. In the village of S&#863;haik&#863;h&#363;p&#363;r, which
belonged to the said parganah, I saw a very large and bulky
banyan-tree, measuring round its trunk 18&frac12; gaz, and in height
from the root to the top of the branches 128&frac14; cubits. The
branches spread a shade for 203&frac12; cubits. The length of a branch,
on which they have represented the tusks of an elephant, was 40 gaz. At
the time when my revered father passed by this, he had made an
impression of his hand by way of a mark at the height of 3&frac34; gaz
from the ground. I ordered them also to make the mark of my hand 8 gaz
above another root. In order that these two hand-marks might not be
effaced in the course of time, they were carved on a piece of marble
and fastened on to the trunk of the tree. I ordered them to place a
<i>chab&#363;tara</i> and platform round the tree.</p>

gift was bestowed in his honour at this halting-place. On the 13th a
march took place. Going separately from this camp to look round the
country and hunt with some of the ladies and intimates and servants, I
proceeded to the village of H&#803;&#257;&#7779;ilp&#363;r, and whilst
the camp was pitched in the neighbourhood of N&#257;lcha
(B&#257;lchha?) I halted at the village of S&#257;ngor. What shall be
written of the beauty and sweetness of this village? There were many
mango-trees, and its lands were altogether green and delightful. On
account of its greenness and pleasantness I halted here for three days.
I gave this village to Kam&#257;l K&#863;h&#257;n, the huntsman, in
place of Kes&#863;ho D&#257;s M&#257;r&#363;. An order was passed that
they should hereafter call it Kam&#257;lp&#363;r. At this same
halting-place occurred the night of S&#863;h&#299;vr&#257;t
(Shivr&#257;tri). Many Jogis collected. The ceremonies of this night
were duly observed, and I met the learned of this body in social
intercourse. In these days I shot three blue bulls. The news of the
killing of R&#257;ja M&#257;n reached me at this place. I had appointed
him to head the army that had been sent against the fort of
K&#257;ng&#7771;&#257;. When he arrived at Lahore he heard that
Sangr&#257;m, one of the zamindars of the hill-country of the Panjab,
had attacked his place and taken possession of part of his province.
Considering it of the first importance to drive him out, he went
against him. As Sangr&#257;m had not the power to oppose him, he left
the country of which he had taken possession and took refuge in
difficult hills and places. R&#257;ja M&#257;n pursued him there, and
in his great pride, not looking to the means by which he himself could
advance and retreat, came up to him with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

them killed. The remainder, wounded, abandoned their horses and arms,
and with a hundred alarms escaped half-dead.</p>
<p class="par">On the 17th I marched from S&#257;ngor, and after
proceeding 3 kos came again to the village of
H&#803;&#257;&#7779;ilp&#363;r. On the road a blue bull was killed.
This village is one of the noted places in the Subah of Malwa. It has
many vines and mango-trees without number. It has streams flowing on
all sides of it. At the time I arrived there were grapes contrary to
the season in which they are in the Wil&#257;yat (Persia or
Afghanistan). They were so cheap and plentiful that the lowest and
meanest could get as much as they desired. The poppy had flowered and
showed varied colours. In brief, there are few villages so pleasant.
For three days more I halted in this village. Three blue bulls were
killed with my gun. From H&#803;&#257;&#7779;ilp&#363;r on the 21st in
two marches I rejoined the big camp. On the road a blue bull was
killed. On Sunday, the 22nd, marching from the neighbourhood of
N&#257;lcha (B&#257;lchha?), I pitched at a lake that is at the foot of
the fort of M&#257;nd&#363;. On that day the huntsmen brought news that
they had marked down a tiger within 3 kos. Although it was Sunday, and
on these two days, viz. Sunday and Thursday, I do not shoot, it
occurred to me that as it is a noxious animal it ought to be done away
with. I proceeded towards him, and when I arrived at the place it was
sitting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name=
"pb363">363</a>]</span>under the shade of a tree. Seeing its mouth,
which was half open, from the back of the elephant, I fired my gun. By
chance it entered its mouth and found a place in its throat and brain,
and its affair was finished with that one shot. After this the people
who were with me, although they looked for the place where the tiger
was wounded, could not find it, for on none of its limbs was there any
sign of a gunshot wound. At last I ordered them to look in its mouth.
From this it was evident that the bullet had entered its mouth and that
it had been killed thereby. M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam had killed a male
wolf and brought it. I wished to see whether its gall-bladder was in
its liver like that of the tiger, or like other animals outside its
liver. After examination it was clear that the gall-bladder was also
inside the liver. On Monday, the 23rd, when one watch had passed in a
fortunate ascension and a benign hour, I mounted an elephant and
approached the fort of M&#257;nd&#363;. When a watch and three gharis
of day had passed, I entered the houses which they had prepared for the
royal accommodation. I scattered 1,500 rupees on the way. From Ajmir to
M&#257;nd&#363;, 159 kos, in the space of four months and two days, in
forty-six marches and seventy-eight halts, had been traversed. In these
forty-six marches our halts were made on the banks of tanks or streams
or large rivers in pleasant places which were full of trees and
poppy-fields in flower, and no day passed that I did not hunt while
halting or travelling. Riding on horseback or on an elephant I came
along the whole way looking about and hunting, and none of the
difficulties of travelling were experienced; one might say that there
was a change from one garden to another. In these huntings there were
always present with me &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, M&#299;rz&#257;
Rustam, M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n, An&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299;,
Hid&#257;yatu-llah, R&#257;ja S&#257;rang Deo, Sayyid K&#257;s&#363;,
and K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K&#863;h&#257;n. As before the
arrival of the royal standards in these <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb364" href="#pb364" name="pb364">364</a>]</span>regions I had sent
&#703;Abdu-l-Kar&#299;m, the architect, to look to the repair of the
buildings of the old rulers in M&#257;nd&#363;, he during the time the
camp halted at Ajmir had repaired some of the old buildings that were
capable of repair, and had altogether rebuilt some places. In short, he
had made ready a house the like of which for pleasantness and sweetness
has probably not been made anywhere else. Nearly 300,000 rupees, or
2,000 Persian tumans, were expended on this. There should be such grand
buildings in all great cities as might be fit for royal accommodation.
This fort is on the top of a hill 10 kos in circumference; in the rainy
season there is no place with the fine air and pleasantness of this
fort. At nights, in the season of the <i>qalbu-l-asad</i> (Cor leonis
of Regulus, the star <span class="trans" title="a"><span class="Greek"
lang="grc">&alpha;</span></span> of Leo), it is so cold that one cannot
do without a coverlet, and by day there is no need for a fan
(<i>b&#257;d-zan</i>). They say<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7876src"
href="#xd24e7876" name="xd24e7876src">89</a> that before the time of
R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t there was a Raja of the name of Jai
Singh Deo. In his time a man had gone into the fields to bring grass.
While he was cutting it, the sickle he had in his hand appeared to be
of the colour of gold. When he saw that his sickle had been transmuted,
he took it to a blacksmith of the name of M&#257;dan<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e7879src" href="#xd24e7879" name="xd24e7879src">90</a> to be
repaired. The blacksmith knew the sickle had been turned into gold. It
had before this been heard that there was in this country the
alchemist&rsquo;s stone (<i>sang-i-p&#257;ras</i>), by contact with
which iron and copper became gold. He immediately took the grass-cutter
with him to that place and procured the stone. After this he brought to
the Raja of the time this priceless jewel. The Raja by means of this
stone made gold, and spent part of it on the buildings of this fort
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=
"pb365">365</a>]</span>and completed them in the space of twelve years.
At the desire of that blacksmith he caused them to cut into the shape
of an anvil most of the stones that were to be built into the wall of
the fort. At the end of his life, when his heart had given up the
world, he held an assembly on the bank of the Narbada, which is an
object of worship among the Hindus, and, assembling brahmins, made
presents to each of cash and jewels. When the turn of a brahmin came
who had long been associated with him, he gave this stone into his
hand. He from ignorance became angry and threw the priceless jewel into
the river. After he came to know the true state of the affair he was a
captive to perpetual sorrow. However much he searched, no trace of it
was found. These things are not written in a book; they have been
heard, but my intelligence in no way accepts this story. It appears to
me to be all delusion. M&#257;nd&#363;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7893src" href="#xd24e7893" name="xd24e7893src">91</a> is one of
the famous Sarkars of the Subah of Malwa. Its revenue is 1,390,000
dams. It was for a long time the capital of the kings of this country.
There are many buildings and traces of former kings in it, and up till
now it has not fallen into ruin.</p>
<p class="par">On the 24th I rode to go round and see the buildings of
the old kings, and went first to the J&#257;mi&#703; mosque, which is
one built by Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#363;s&#863;hang
G&#863;h&#363;r&#299;. A very lofty building came to view, all of cut
stone, and although 180 years have passed since the time of its
building, it is as if the builder had just withdrawn his hand from it.
After this I went to the building containing the tombs of the
K&#863;halj&#299; rulers. The grave of Na&#7779;&#299;ru-d-d&#299;n,
son of Sult&#804;&#257;n G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n, whose
face is blackened for ever, was also there. It is well known that that
wretch advanced himself by the murder of his own father,
G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n, who was in his 80th year. Twice
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>he gave him poison, and he twice expelled it by
means of a <i>zahr-muhra</i> (poison antidote, bezoar) he had on his
arm. The third time he mixed poison in a cup of sherbet and gave it to
his father with his own hand, saying he must drink it. As his father
understood what efforts he was making in this matter, he loosened the
zahr-muhra from his arm and threw it before him, and then turning his
face in humility and supplication towards the throne of the Creator,
who requires no supplication, said: &ldquo;O Lord, my age has arrived
at 80 years, and I have passed this time in prosperity and happiness
such as has been attained to by no king. Now as this is my last time, I
hope that Thou wilt not seize Na&#7779;&#299;r for my murder, and that
reckoning my death as a thing decreed Thou wilt not avenge it.&rdquo;
After he had spoken these words, he drank off that poisoned cup of
sherbet at a gulp and delivered his soul to the Creator. The meaning of
his preamble was that he had passed the time of his reign in enjoyment
such as has not been attained to by any of the kings. When in his 48th
year he came to the throne, he said to his intimates and those near
him, &ldquo;In the service of my revered father I have passed thirty
years in warfare and have committed no fault in my activity as a
soldier; now that my turn to reign has arrived, I have no intention to
conquer countries, but desire to pass the remainder of my life in ease
and enjoyment.&rdquo; They say that he had collected 15,000 women in
his harem. He had a whole city of them, and had made it up of all
castes, kinds, and descriptions&mdash;artificers, magistrates, qazis,
kotwals, and whatever else is necessary for the administration of a
town. Wherever he heard of a virgin possessed of beauty, he would not
desist (lit. did not sit down from his feet) until he possessed her. He
taught the girls all kinds of arts and crafts, and was much inclined to
hunt. He had made a deer park and collected all kinds of animals in it.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>He often used to hunt in it with his women. In
brief, in the period of thirty-two years of his reign, as he had
determined, he went against no enemy, and passed this time in ease and
enjoyment. In the same way no one invaded his country. It is reported
that when S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n, the Afghan, in the time of
his rule, came to the tomb of Na&#7779;&#299;ru-d-d&#299;n, he, in
spite of his brutish nature, on account of
Na&#7779;&#299;ru-d-d&#299;n&rsquo;s shameful conduct, ordered the head
of the tomb to be beaten with sticks. Also when I went to his tomb I
gave it several kicks, and ordered the servants in attendance on me to
kick the tomb. Not satisfied with this, I ordered the tomb to be broken
open and his impure remains to be thrown into the fire. Then it
occurred to me that since fire is Light, it was a pity for the Light of
Allah to be polluted with burning his filthy body; also, lest there
should be any diminution of torture for him in another state from being
thus burnt, I ordered them to throw his crumbled bones, together with
his decayed limbs, into the Narbada. During his lifetime he always
passed his days in the water in consequence of the heat that had
acquired a mastery over his temperament. It is well known that in a
state of drunkenness he once threw himself into one of the basins at
K&#257;liy&#257;daha, which was very deep. Some of the attendants in
the harem exerted themselves and caught his hair in their hands and
drew him out of the water. After he had come to his senses they told
him that this thing had happened. When he had heard that they had
pulled him out by the hair of his head, he became exceedingly angry,
and ordered the hands of the attendants to be cut off. Another time,
when an affair of this kind took place, no one had the boldness to pull
him out and he was drowned. By chance, after 110 years had passed since
his death, it came to pass that his decayed limbs also became mingled
with the water. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368"
name="pb368">368</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">On the 28th, as a reward for the buildings of
M&#257;nd&#363; having been completed through his excellent exertions,
I promoted &#703;Abdu-l-Kar&#299;m to the rank of 800 personal and 400
horse, and dignified him with the title of Ma&#703;m&#363;r
K&#863;h&#257;n (the architect-K&#863;h&#257;n). On the same day that
the royal standards entered the fort of M&#257;nd&#363;, my son of
lofty fortune, Sult&#804;&#257;n K&#863;hurram, with the victorious
army, entered the city of Burhanpur, which is the seat of the governor
of the province of Khandesh.</p>
<p class="par">After some days, representations came from Afz&#803;al
K&#863;h&#257;n and the R&#257;y R&#257;y&#257;n, to whom at the time
of leaving Ajmir my son had given leave to accompany the ambassador to
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, reporting that when the news of our
coming reached &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n he came out for 7 kos to
meet the order and the litter of the prince, and performed the duties
of salutation and respect which are customary at Court. He did not omit
a hair&rsquo;s point of such ceremonies. At the same interview he
professed the greatest loyalty, and promised that he would restore all
those provinces that &#703;Ambar of dark fate had taken from the
victorious State, and agreed to send to the Court with all reverence a
fitting offering with his ambassadors. After saying this he brought the
ambassadors in all dignity to the place that had been prepared for
them. On the same day he sent some one to &#703;Ambar with a message of
the matters it was necessary to acquaint him with. I heard this news
from the reports of Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n and the R&#257;y
R&#257;y&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">From Ajmir up to Monday, the 23rd of the
aforesaid<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7913src" href="#xd24e7913" name=
"xd24e7913src">92</a> month, during four months, 2 tigers, 27 blue
bulls, 6 <i>ch&#299;tal</i> (spotted deer), 60 deer, 23 hares and
foxes, and 1,200 water-fowl and other animals had been killed. On these
nights I told the story of my former hunting expeditions and the liking
I had for this occupation to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href=
"#pb369" name="pb369">369</a>]</span>those standing at the foot of the
throne of the Caliphate. It occurred to me that I might make up the
account of my game from the commencement of my years of discretion up
to the present time. I accordingly gave orders to the news-writers, the
hunt-accountants and huntsmen, and others employed in this service to
make enquiries and tell me of all the animals that had been killed in
hunting. It was shown that from the commencement of my 12th year, which
was in 988 (1580), up to the end of this year, which is the 11th year
after my accession and my 50th lunar year, 28,532 head of game had been
taken in my presence. Of these, 17,167 animals I killed myself with my
gun or otherwise, viz.: Quadrupeds, 3,203; viz., tigers, 86; bears,
cheetahs, foxes, otters (<i>&#363;dbil&#257;o</i>), and hy&aelig;nas,

&ldquo;It is a pity that no trace of these is left at Agra. Had there

been supposed to have been put up by Akbar and to represent Chitor
heroes. The word <i>tark&#299;b</i> in the text may mean that they were

has <i>g&#363;sfand-i-nar</i>, &lsquo;a ram,&rsquo; but the MSS. have
<i>g&#363;sfand u bar</i>, or buz, and it is evident that the true
reading is &lsquo;a sheep, a goat.&rsquo; See Blochmann, p. 266, where
goats are mentioned among the animals distributed by Akbar. The number
of animals distributed corresponded with the years of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s age (48) multiplied by 3, and so would be 48
&times; 3 = 144 (see Blochmann, l.c.). The weight of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
was 6,514 tulchas, and Blochmann (p. 267, n.) takes this to be the same
as tolas, and estimates Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s weight at
210&frac12; lb. troy or 15 stone. Probably this is excessive, and his
weight might be 82 sir or about 2 maunds, i.e. 164 lb. or 11&frac12;
stone. The perfumes against which he was weighed were ambergris, not
amber (which has no scent), <i>&#703;&#363;d</i>, i.e. lignum aloes,
and <i>b&#257;n</i> (not <i>p&#257;n</i> as in text), which apparently
is the same as <i>lub&#257;n</i>, &lsquo;frankincense&rsquo; (see the
chapter on perfumes in Blochmann, p. 77). I am not sure of the meaning
of the phrase <i>ba-dast nih&#257;da</i>. The MSS. have not the
preposition <i>ba</i>. Perhaps the meaning is &lsquo;put them into the
hands of the fakirs.&rsquo; Jah&#257;ng&#299;r was born on the 18th
S&#863;hahr&#299;war, 977 = 31st August, 1569. The weighings described
in the text took place on the 26th S&#863;hahr&#299;war. Perhaps this
was because his birthday was on the 24th S&#863;hahr&#299;war according
to the Jal&#257;l&#299; year.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

By the latter part of the sentence Jah&#257;ng&#299;r means that

Evidently the four-horned antelope, the <i>Tetracerus quadricornis</i>
of Blanford, p. 520, and which has the Hindustani name of <i>doda</i>.
Blanford describes its colour as dull pale brown. &ldquo;The posterior
horns are much larger than the anterior ones, which are situated
between the orbits and are often mere knobs. It is the only Indian
representative of the <i>duikarbok</i> of Africa. Another Indian name
is <i>chausingha</i>. In jungle this species and the hog-deer may
easily be mistaken the one for the other. It is not gregarious, and
moves with a peculiar jerky action.&rdquo; The resemblance between the
four-horned antelope and the hog-deer&mdash;the <i>k&#363;t&#257;h
p&#257;ycha</i> or short-legged deer of B&#257;bar and
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&mdash;may account for Blanford&rsquo;s giving
<i>doda</i> as a native name for the hog-deer (<i>Cervus porcinus</i>).
For B&#257;bar&rsquo;s description of the <i>k&#363;t&#257;h
p&#257;ya</i> or <i>p&#257;ycha</i> see Erskine, p. 317. Gladwin in his
history of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r writes the native name as
<i>Dirdhayan</i>.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One ghari of day remained of Monday, the 30th of
the aforesaid (Isfand&#299;y&#257;r) month, corresponding to the 12th
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal, 1026 (20th March, 1617), when the sun changed
from the constellation of Pisces into the pleasure-house of Aries,
which is his abode of honour and good fortune. At the very time of
transit, which was a fortunate hour, I sat upon the throne. I had
ordered that according to the usual custom they should decorate the
public audience hall with fine cloths, etc. Notwithstanding that many
of the Amirs and chief men of the State were in attendance on my son
K&#863;hurram, a meeting was arranged which was not inferior to those
of previous years. I presented the offerings of Tuesday<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8008src" href="#xd24e8008" name="xd24e8008src">1</a>
to &#256;nand K&#863;h&#257;n. On the same day, which was the 1st
Farward&#299;n of the 12th year (21st or 22nd March, 1617) a
representation arrived from S&#863;h&#257;h K&#863;hurram to the effect
that the New Year&rsquo;s festival had been arranged for in the same
manner as in previous years, but as the days of travelling and service
had occurred the annual offerings of the servants would be remitted.
This proceeding of my son was much approved. Remembering my dear son in
my prayers, I besought for him from the throne of Allah his welfare in
both worlds, and ordered that on this New Year&rsquo;s Day no one
should present offerings.</p>
<p class="par">In consequence of the disturbance that tobacco brings
about in most temperaments and constitutions, I had ordered that no one
should smoke it (lit. draw). My brother S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;Abb&#257;s had also become aware of the mischief arising from it,
and had ordered that in Iran no one should venture to smoke. As

without control in continual smoking of tobacco, he frequently
practised it. Y&#257;dg&#257;r &#703;Al&#299; Sult&#804;&#257;n,

&#703;Abb&#257;s that K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam could never be a

this couplet in answer&mdash;</p>

<p class="par first">On the 3rd of the same month, H&#803;usain Beg,
the diwan of Bengal, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and
made an offering of twelve elephants, male and female.
T&#804;&#257;hir, bakhshi of Bengal, who had been accused of several
offences, obtained the favour of paying his respects to me, and
presented before me an offering of twenty-one elephants. Twelve of
these were approved and the remainder I conferred on him. On this day a
wine-feast was arranged, and I gave wine to most of the servants who
were engaged in waiting on me, and made them all heated with the wine
of loyalty. On the 4th the huntsmen sent news that they had marked down
a lion in the neighbourhood of the Shakkar<a class="noteref" id=

is inside the fort and one of the famous constructions of the rulers of
Malwa. I at once mounted and went towards that game. When the lion
appeared he charged the ahadis and the retinue and wounded ten<a class=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name=

9th, at the request of my son K&#863;hurram, I increased the mansab of
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n by 1,000 personal and horse, making it thus
6,000 personal and horse; that of Ya&#703;q&#363;b K&#863;h&#257;n,
which was 1,500 personal with 1,000 horse, was made 2,000 personal and
1,500 horse; that of Bahl&#363;l K&#863;h&#257;n Miy&#257;na<a class=

was increased by 500 personal and 300 horse to 1,500 personal and 1,000
horse; and that of M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;harafu-d-d&#299;n
K&#257;s&#863;hg&#863;har&#299;, by whom and his son great bravery had
been shown in the Deccan, was increased to 1,500 personal and 1,000
horse. On the 10th Farward&#299;n, corresponding with the 22nd
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal, 1026, my lunar weighing took place. On this
day two &#703;Iraq horses from my private stable and a dress of honour
were conferred on my son K&#863;hurram and sent to him by Bahr&#257;m
Beg. I increased the mansab of I&#703;tib&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n to
5,000 personal and 3,000 horse. On the 11th, H&#803;usain Beg, of
Tabriz, whom the ruler of Iran had sent to the ruler of Golconda by way
of embassy, as, in consequence of the quarrel of the Franks with the
Persians, the road of the M&#299;r had been closed,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e8050src" href="#xd24e8050" name="xd24e8050src">6</a> waited
upon me with the ambassador of the ruler of Golconda. Offerings came

(nine-pieces?) of cloth from the Deccan and Gujarat. On the same day an
&#703;Iraq horse from my private stable was bestowed on K&#863;h&#257;n
Jah&#257;n. On the 15th, 1,000 personal were added to the mansab of
M&#299;rz&#257; R&#257;ja Bh&#257;o Singh, raising it to 5,000 personal
and 3,000 horse. On the 17th, 500 horse were added to the mansab of
M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam, and I made it up to 5,000 personal and 1,000
horse; that of S&#257;diq K&#863;h&#257;n was fixed at 1,500 personal
and 700 horse, original and increase; Ir&#257;dat K&#863;h&#257;n in
the same manner was raised to the mansab of 1,500 and <span class=

horse. To the mansab of An&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299; 500 personal and
100 horse were added, and it was made one of 1,500 personal and 500
horse. Three gharis of Saturday, the 19th, remained when the beginning
of the <i>s&#863;haraf</i> (day of sun&rsquo;s culmination) occurred,
and at the same time I again took my seat on the throne. Of the
thirty-two prisoners from the army of the rebel &#703;Ambar who had
been captured by the servants of the victorious State in the battle won
by S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n and the defeat of that
disastrous man (&#703;Ambar), I had handed one man over to
I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n. The guards who had been appointed to
keep him showed carelessness and let him escape. I was much annoyed at
this, and I forbade I&#703;tiq&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n to come to wait
on me for three months. As the said prisoner&rsquo;s name and condition
were unknown, he was not caught again, although they showed activity in
the matter. At last I ordered the captain of the guards who had been
careless in keeping him to be capitally punished. I&#703;tiq&#257;d
K&#863;h&#257;n on this day, at the request of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, had the good fortune to pay his respects
to me.</p>
<p class="par">As for a long time no good had been heard of the affairs
of Bengal and of the conduct of Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n, it entered
my mind to send to the Subah of Bengal Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
K&#863;h&#257;n Fath&#803;-jang, who had carried on successfully the
affairs of the Subah of Behar and had brought a diamond mine into the
possession of the State, and to despatch Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n, who had a jagir in the Subah of Allahabad, in his
place to Behar. I sent for Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n to Court. At the
same hour on the auspicious day (the day of culmination) an order was
given that they should write royal farmans to the effect that
<i>saz&#257;wal&#257;n</i> (revenue collectors) should be appointed to
take Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n to Behar and to send
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n Fath&#803;-jang to Bengal.
Patronizing Sikandar,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8076src" href=

"pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=

personal and 300 horse.</p>
<p class="par">On the 21st I gave leave to Muh&#803;ammad
Riz&#803;&#257;, ambassador of the ruler of Iran, and bestowed on him
60,000 darbs, equal to 30,000 rupees, with a dress of honour. As an
equivalent to the souvenir (<i>y&#257;d-b&#363;d&#299;</i>) that my
brother S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s had sent to me, I forwarded
with the aforesaid ambassador certain presents of jewelled things which
the rulers of the Deccan had sent, with cloths and rare things of every
kind fit for presentation, of the value of 100,000 rupees. Among these
was a crystal cup that Cheleb&#299;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8086src"
href="#xd24e8086" name="xd24e8086src">9</a> had sent from &#703;Iraq.
The Shah had seen this cup and said to the ambassador that if his
brother (Jah&#257;ng&#299;r) would drink wine out of it and send it to
him it would be a great mark of affection. When the ambassador
represented this, having drunk wine several times out of the cup in his
presence, I ordered them to make a lid and a saucer for it and sent it
along with the presents. The lid was of enamel
(<i>m&#299;n&#257;-k&#257;r&#299;</i>). I ordered the Munshis of
mercurial writing (<i>&#703;Ut&#804;&#257;rid-raqm</i>) to write in due
form an answer to the letter he had brought.</p>
<p class="par">On the 22nd the scouts brought in news of a tiger.
Mounting immediately, I went against the tiger and with three shots I
delivered the people from his wickedness, and himself from the
wickedness of his vile nature. Mas&#299;h&#803;u-z-zam&#257;n produced
before me a cat, and represented that it was a hermaphrodite, and that
in his house it had young ones, and that when it had connection with
another cat, young were born to the latter.</p>
<p class="par">On the 25th the contingent of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah passed before me in review on the plain
under the jharoka. There were 2,000 cavalry well horsed, most of whom
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name=
"pb375">375</a>]</span>were Moghuls, 500 foot armed with bows and guns,
and fourteen elephants. The bakhshis reckoned them up and reported that
this force was fully equipped and according to rule. On the 26th a
tigress was killed. On Thursday, the 1st Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, a
diamond that Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n had sent by runners was laid
before me; it weighed 23 <i>surkh</i>, and the jewellers valued it at
30,000 rupees. It was a diamond of the first water, and was much
approved. I ordered them to make a ring of it. On the 3rd the mansab of
Y&#363;suf K&#863;h&#257;n was, at the request of B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram, fixed at 1,000 with 1,500 horse and in the same way the
mansabs of several of the Amirs and mansabdars were increased at his
suggestion. On the 7th, as the huntsmen had marked down four tigers,
when two watches and three gharis had passed I went out to hunt them
with my ladies. When the tigers came in sight N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam
submitted that if I would order her she herself would kill the tigers
with her gun. I said, &ldquo;Let it be so.&rdquo; She shot two tigers
with one shot each and knocked over the two others with four shots. In
the twinkling of an eye she deprived of life the bodies of these four
tigers. Until now such shooting was never seen, that from the top of an
elephant and inside of a howdah (<i>&#703;am&#257;r&#299;</i>) six
shots should be made and not one miss, so that the four beasts found no
opportunity to spring or move.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8107src"
href="#xd24e8107" name="xd24e8107src">10</a> As a reward for this good
shooting I gave her a pair of bracelets<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8122src" href="#xd24e8122" name="xd24e8122src">11</a>
(<i>pahunch&#299;</i>) of diamonds worth 100,000 rupees and scattered
1,000 ashrafis (over her). On the same day Ma&#703;m&#363;r
K&#863;h&#257;n (the architect-K&#863;h&#257;n) <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name=
"pb376">376</a>]</span>obtained leave to go to Lahore to complete the
buildings of the palace there. On the 10th the death of Sayyid
W&#257;ris&#804;, who was faujd&#257;r of the Subah of Oudh, was
reported. On the 12th, as M&#299;r Mah&#803;m&#363;d asked for a
faujd&#257;rship, I dignified him with the title of Tahawwur
K&#863;h&#257;n, and, increasing his mansab, appointed him to the
faujd&#257;rship of some of the parganahs of the Subah of Multan. On
the 22nd, T&#804;&#257;hir, the bakhshi of Bengal, who had been
forbidden to pay his respects, waited upon me and presented his
offerings. Eight elephants were also presented as the offering of
Q&#257;sim K&#863;h&#257;n, governor of Bengal, and two as that of
S&#863;haik&#863;h Modh&#363;. On the 28th, at the request of
K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n, an order was given for the increase of the
mansab of &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K&#863;h&#257;n by 500. On the
5th K&#863;hurd&#257;d the duty of the Diwanship of Gujarat was given
to M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;usain in supercession of Kes&#863;ho. I
dignified him with the title of Kif&#257;yat K&#863;h&#257;n. On the
8th, Las&#863;hkar K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been appointed bakhshi of
Bangash, came and waited on me; he offered 100 muhrs and 500 rupees.
Some days before this &#362;st&#257;d Muh&#803;ammad N&#257;y&#299;
(flute-player), who was unequalled in his craft, was sent by my son
K&#863;hurram at my summons. I had heard some of his musical
pieces<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8131src" href="#xd24e8131" name=
"xd24e8131src">12</a> (<i>majlis-s&#257;z</i>), and he played a tune
which he had composed for an ode (<i>g&#863;hazal</i>) in my name. On
the 12th I ordered him to be weighed against rupees; this came to 6,300
rupees. I also gave him an elephant with a howdah,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e8140src" href="#xd24e8140" name="xd24e8140src">13</a> and I
ordered him to ride on it and, having packed<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8146src" href="#xd24e8146" name="xd24e8146src">14</a> his rupees
about him, to proceed to his lodging. Mull&#257; Asad, the
story-teller, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name=
"pb377">377</a>]</span>one of the servants of M&#299;rz&#257;
G&#863;h&#257;z&#299;, came on the same day from Tattah and waited on
me. As he was a reciter and story-teller full of sweetness and
smartness, I liked his society, and I made him happy with the title of
Mah&#803;z&#804;&#363;z&#804; K&#863;h&#257;n, and gave him 1,000
rupees, a dress of honour, a horse, an elephant, and a palanquin. After
some days I ordered him to be weighed against rupees, and his weight
came up to 4,400. He was raised to the mansab of 200 personal and 20
horse. I ordered him always to be present at the meetings for talk
(<i>gap</i>). On the same day Las&#863;hkar K&#863;h&#257;n brought his
men to the <i>dars&#863;han jharoka</i> before me. There were 500
horse, 14 elephants, and 100 musketeers. On the 24th news came that
Mah&#257; Singh, grandson of R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh, who was entered
among the great officers, had died from excessive wine-drinking at
B&#257;l&#257;p&#363;r in the province of Berar. His father also had
died at the age of 32<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8160src" href=
"#xd24e8160" name="xd24e8160src">15</a> from the drinking of wine
beyond measure. On the same day they had brought to my private
fruit-house many mangoes from all parts of the province of the Deccan,
Burhanpur, Gujarat, and the parganahs of Malwa. Although this province
is well known and celebrated for the sweetness, freedom from
stringiness, and size of its mangoes, and there are few mangoes that
equal its mangoes&mdash;so much so that I often ordered them to be
weighed in my presence, when they were shown to come to a seer or
1&frac14; seer or even more&mdash;yet in sweetness of water and
delicious flavour and digestibility the mangoes of
Chapr&#257;mau,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8163src" href="#xd24e8163"
name="xd24e8163src">16</a> in the province of Agra, are superior to all
the mangoes of this province and of all other places in India.</p>
<p class="par">On the 28th I sent for my son B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram a special gold-embroidered <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> of a
fineness such as had never <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href=
"#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span>been produced before in my
establishment; I ordered the bearer to tell him that as this rarity had
the speciality that I had worn it on the day I quitted Ajmir for the
conquest of the Deccan, I had sent it to him. On the same day I placed
the turban from my own head, just as it was, on the head of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah, and honoured him with this favour. Three
emeralds, a piece of jewelled <i>&#363;rbas&#299;</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8177src" href="#xd24e8177" name=
"xd24e8177src">17</a> and a ruby signet ring that Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n had sent by way of offering were laid before me. They
came to 7,000 rupees in value. On this day, by the mercy and favour of
Allah, continued rain fell. Water in M&#257;nd&#363; had become very
scarce and the people were agitated about the matter so that most of
the servants had been ordered to go to the bank of the Narbada. There
was no expectation of rain at that season. In consequence of the
agitation of the people I turned by way of supplication to the throne
of God, and He in His mercy and grace gave such rain that in the course
of a day and a night tanks, ponds (<i>birkah&#257;</i>), and rivers
became full, and the agitation of the people was changed to complete
ease. With what tongue can I render thanks for this favour? On the 1st
of T&#299;r a standard was presented to Waz&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n. The
offering of the R&#257;n&#257;, consisting of two horses, a piece of
Gujarati cloth, and some jars of pickles and preserves, was laid before
me. On the 3rd, Mu&#703;azz&#257;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8189src"
href="#xd24e8189" name="xd24e8189src">18</a>(?) brought news of the
capture of &#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f, a descendant of the rulers of
Gujarat, who had always been the originator of mischief and disturbance
in that Subah. As his capture was a reason for the contentment of the
people, praise was given to God, and I ordered Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n
to send him to Court <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379"
name="pb379">379</a>]</span>by one of his mansabdars. Many of the
zamindars in the neighbourhood of M&#257;nd&#363;, came and waited on
me, and laid offerings before me. On the 8th, R&#257;m D&#257;s, son of
R&#257;ja R&#257;j Singh Kachhw&#257;ha, was given the
<i>&#7789;&#299;ka</i> of a Raja, and I honoured him with that title.
Y&#257;dg&#257;r Beg, who was known in M&#257;war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr
(Transoxiana) as Y&#257;dg&#257;r Q&#363;rch&#299;, and had not been
without connection and influence with the ruler of that country, came
and waited on me. Of all his offerings a white china cup on a stand was
the most approved. The offering of Bah&#257;dur K&#863;h&#257;n,
governor of Qandahar, consisting of nine horses, nine <i>tuq&#363;z</i>
of fine cloth (81 pieces?), two black foxes&rsquo; skins, and other
things, was brought before me. Also on this day the R&#257;ja of
Gadeha, Pem<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8206src" href="#xd24e8206" name=
"xd24e8206src">19</a> Nar&#257;yan, had the good fortune to wait on me,
and made an offering of seven elephants, male and female. On the 10th a
horse and dress of honour were given to Y&#257;dg&#257;r
Q&#363;rch&#299;. On the 13th was the feast of rose-water scattering
(<i>gul&#257;b-p&#257;s&#863;h&#257;n</i>). The rites due to that day
were performed. S&#863;haik&#863;h Maud&#363;d Chis&#863;ht&#299;, one
of the officers of Bengal, was honoured with the title of
Chis&#863;ht&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, and I presented him with a horse.
On the 14th, R&#257;wal Samars&#299; (Samarsim&#803;ha), son of
R&#257;wal &#362;day Singh, zamindar of B&#257;nsw&#257;la, waited on
me; he gave as offering 30,000 rupees, three elephants, a jewelled
<i>p&#257;n-d&#257;n</i> (box for betel), and a jewelled belt. On the
15th nine diamonds which Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n
Fath&#803;-jang, the governor of Behar, had sent along with Muhammad
Beg from the mine, and from the collections of the zamindars of that
place, were laid before me. Of these, one weighed 14&frac12; tanks, and
was of the value of 100,000 rupees. On the same day Y&#257;dg&#257;r
Q&#363;rch&#299; was presented with 14,000 darbs, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span>and
I promoted him to the mansab of 500 personal and 300 horse. I fixed the
mansab of T&#257;t&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n,
<i>bak&#257;wul-beg&#299;</i> (chief steward), original and increase,
at 2,000 personal and 300 horse, and each of his sons was separately
promoted to an increased mansab. At the request of Prince
Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z, I increased the personal mansab of
Waz&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n by 500.</p>
<p class="par">On the 29th, which was the auspicious day of Thursday,
Sayyid &#703;Abdu-llah B&#257;rha, the envoy of my son of good fortune,
B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram, waited on me, and presented a letter from
that son containing news of a victory over the provinces of the Deccan.
All the chiefs, laying the head of duty in the noose of obedience, had
consented to service and humility, and laid before him the keys of
forts and strongholds, especially the fort of Ahmadnagar. In gratitude
for this great favour and beneficence, placing the head of supplication
on the throne of that God who requires no return, I opened my lips in
thankfulness, and, humbling myself, ordered them to beat the drums of
rejoicing. Thanks be to Allah that a territory that had passed out of
hand has come back into the possession of the servants of the
victorious State, and that the seditious, who had been breathing the
breath of rebellion and boasting, have turned towards supplication and
weakness, and become deliverers of properties and payers of tribute. As
this news reached me through N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam, I gave her the
parganah of Boda (&#7788;o&#7693;&#257;?),<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8226src" href="#xd24e8226" name="xd24e8226src">20</a> the revenue
of which is 200,000 rupees. Please God, when the victorious forces
enter the province of the Deccan and its forts, and the mind of my
excellent son K&#863;hurram is satisfied with regard to their
possession, he will bring with the ambassadors such an offering from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381" name=
"pb381">381</a>]</span>the Deccan as no other king of this age has
received. It was ordered that he should bring with him the Amirs who
were to receive jagirs in this Subah, in order that they might have the
honour of waiting on me. They will thereafter get leave to depart, and
the glorious royal standards will return with victory and rejoicing to
the capital of Agra. Some days before the news of this victory reached
me, I took one night an augury from the diwan of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804; as to what would be the end of this affair, and
this ode turned up&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The day of absence and night of parting from the
friend are o&rsquo;er.</p>
<p class="line">I took this augury; the star passed and fulfilment
came.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8236src" href="#xd24e8236"
name="xd24e8236src">21</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par first">When the secret tongue
(<i>lis&#257;nu-l-g&#863;haib</i>) of H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804; showed
such an ending it gave me a strong hope, and accordingly, after
twenty-five days, the news of victory arrived. In many of my desires I
have resorted to the K&#863;hw&#257;ja&rsquo;s diwan, and (generally)
the result has coincided with what I found there. It is seldom that the
opposite has happened.</p>
<p class="par">On the same day I added 1,000 horse to the mansab of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n, and raised it to that of 5,000
personal and horse. At the end of the day I went with the ladies to
look round the building of the Haft Manz&#804;ar<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8246src" href="#xd24e8246" name="xd24e8246src">22</a> (seven
storeys), and at the beginning of the evening returned to the palace.
This building was founded by a former ruler of Malwa, Sult&#804;&#257;n
Mah&#803;m&#363;d K&#863;halj&#299;. It has seven storeys, and in each
storey there are four chambers (<i>&#7779;uffa</i>) containing four
windows. The height of this tower (<i>m&#299;n&#257;r</i>) is
54&frac12; cubits, and its circumference 50 yards (<i>gaz</i>). There
are 171 steps from the ground <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382"
href="#pb382" name="pb382">382</a>]</span>to the seventh storey. In
going and returning I scattered 1,400 rupees.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8261src" href="#xd24e8261" name="xd24e8261src">23</a></p>
<p class="par">On the 31st I honoured Sayyid &#703;Abdu-llah with the
title of Saif K&#863;h&#257;n, and having exalted him with a dress of
honour, a horse, an elephant, and a jewelled dagger, gave him leave and
sent him to do duty with my son of lofty fortune. I also sent by him a
ruby of the value of more than 30,000 rupees for my son. I did not
regard its value, but as for a long time I used to bind it on my own
head, I sent it him by way of good augury, considering it lucky for
him. I appointed Sult&#804;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d, a son-in-law of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-h&#803;asan bakhshi, to be bakhshi and
news-writer of the Subah of Behar, and when he took leave I gave him an
elephant. At the end of the day of Thursday, 5th Amurd&#257;d, I went
with the ladies to see the N&#299;l-kun&#7693;, which is one of the
most<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8266src" href="#xd24e8266" name=
"xd24e8266src">24</a> pleasant places in the fort of Mandu
(M&#257;n&#7693;oga&#7771;h). S&#863;h&#257;h-bud&#257;g&#863;h
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of my revered father&rsquo;s most
considerable Amirs, at the time when he held this province in jagir,
built in this place an exceedingly pleasing and enjoyable building.
Delaying there till two or three gharis of night had passed I returned
to the auspicious palace.</p>
<p class="par">As several indiscretions on the part of
Muk&#863;hli&#7779; K&#863;h&#257;n diwan and bakhshi of the Subah of
Bengal, had come to my ears, I reduced his mansab by 1,000 personal and
200 horse. On the 7th a war (<i>mast&#299;</i>) elephant from among
those sent as offerings by &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, by name
Gaj-r&#257;j, was sent to R&#257;n&#257; Amr Singh. On the 11th, I went
out to hunt and came one stage from the fort. There was excessive rain,
and the mud was such that there was hardly any moving. For the
convenience of the people and the comfort of the animals I gave up
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name=
"pb383">383</a>]</span>this undertaking, and passing the day of
Thursday outside, returned on Friday eve. On the same day
Hid&#257;yatu-llah, who is very well suited to carry out the rules and
movements (in travelling) of the headquarters (lit. presence), was
honoured with the title of Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n. In
this rainy season rain fell in such quantities that old men said that
they did not remember such rain in any age. For nearly forty days there
was nothing but cloud and rain, so that the sun only appeared
occasionally. There was so much wind that many buildings, both old and
new, fell down. On the first night there was<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8276src" href="#xd24e8276" name="xd24e8276src">25</a> such rain
and thunder and lightning as has seldom been heard of. Nearly twenty
women and men were killed, and the foundations even of some of the
stone buildings were broken up. No noise is more terrifying than this.
Till the middle of the month was passed, wind and rain increased. After
this they gradually became less. What can be written of the verdure and
self-grown fragrant plants? They covered valley and plain and hill and
desert. It is not known if in the inhabited world there exists another
such place as Mandu for sweetness of air and for the pleasantness of
the locality and the neighbourhood, especially in the rainy season. In
this season, which lasts for months and extends up to the hot weather,
one cannot sleep inside houses without coverlets, and in the day the
temperature is such that there is no need for a fan or for change of
place. All that could be written would still fall short of the many
beauties of the place. I saw two things that I had not seen in any
other place in Hindustan. One was the tree of the wild plantain that
grows in most of the uncultivated places in the fort, and the other the
nest of the wagtail (<i>mam&#363;la</i>), which they call in Persian
the <i>dum-s&#299;cha</i> (tail-wagger). Up till now none of the
hunters had pointed out its nest. By <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb384" href="#pb384" name="pb384">384</a>]</span>chance in the
building I occupied there was its nest, and it brought out two young
ones.</p>
<p class="par">Three watches of day had passed on Thursday, the 19th,
when I mounted with the ladies in order to go round and see the courts
and buildings on the Shakkar tank, founded by former rulers of Malwa.
As an elephant had not been conferred on I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daulah on
account of his government of the Panjab, I gave him on the road one of
my private elephants of the name of Jagjot. I remained in this
enchanting place until the evening, and was much delighted with the
pleasantness and greenness of the surrounding open spaces. After
performing my evening prayer and counting my rosary, we returned to our
fixed residence. On Friday an elephant named Ran-b&#257;dal (cloud of
war?), which Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n had sent as
an offering, was brought before me. Having adopted for myself certain
special cloths and cloth-stuffs, I gave an order that no one should
wear the same but he on whom I might bestow them. One was a
<i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> coat that they wear over the <i>qab&#257;</i>
(a kind of outer vest). Its length is from the waist down to below the
thighs, and it has no sleeves. It is fastened in front with buttons,
and the people of Persia call it <i>kurd&#299;</i> (from the country of
the Kurds). I gave it the name of nadiri. Another garment is a
T&#804;&#363;s shawl, which my revered father had adopted as a dress.
The next was a coat (qaba) with a folded collar (<i>bat&#363;
gir&#299;b&#257;n</i>). The ends of the sleeves were embroidered. He
had also appropriated this to himself. Another was a qaba with a
border, from which the fringes of cloth were cut off and sewn round the
skirt and collar and the ends of the sleeve. Another was a qaba of
Gujarati satin, and another a <i>ch&#299;ra</i> and waistbelt woven
with silk, in which were interwoven gold and silver threads.</p>
<p class="par">As the monthly pay of some of Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s horsemen, according to the regulation of three
and two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385" name=

been performed, I gave an order that the civil officers
(<i>d&#299;w&#257;niy&#257;n</i>) should levy the difference from his
jagir. In the end of Thursday, the 26th, corresponding with the 14th
S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n, which is the S&#863;hab-i-bar&#257;t, I held a
meeting in one of the houses of the palace of N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n
Begam, which was situated in the midst of large tanks, and summoning
the Amirs and courtiers to the feast which had been prepared by the
Begam, I ordered them to give the people cups and all kinds of
intoxicating drinks according to the desire of each. Many asked for
cups, and I ordered that whoever drank a cup should sit according to
his mansab and condition. All sorts of roast meats, and fruits by way
of relish, were ordered to be placed before everyone. It was a
wonderful assembly. In the beginning of the evening they lighted
lanterns and lamps all round the tanks and buildings, and a lighting up
was carried out the like of which has perhaps never been arranged in
any place. The lanterns and lamps cast their reflection on the water,
and it appeared as if the whole surface of the tank was a plain of
fire. A grand entertainment took place, and the drinkers of cups took
more cups than they could carry.</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="par">After three of four gharis of night had passed, I
dismissed the men and summoned the ladies, and till a watch of night
(remained?) passed the time in this delightful place, and enjoyed
myself. On this day of Thursday several special things had happened.
One was that it was the day of my ascension of the throne; secondly, it
was the S&#863;hab-i-bar&#257;t, thirdly, it was the day of the
<i>r&#257;kh&#299;</i>, which has already been described, and with the
Hindus is a special day. On account of these three pieces of good
fortune I called the day Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba.</p>
<p class="par">On the 27th, Sayyid K&#257;s&#363; was dignified with
the title of Parwaris&#863;h K&#863;h&#257;n. Wednesday in the same way
that Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba had been a fortunate one for me had
fallen out exactly the opposite. On this account I gave this evil day
the name of Kam-s&#863;hamba, in order that this day might always fail
from the world (lessen). On the next day a jewelled dagger was
conferred on Y&#257;dg&#257;r Q&#363;rch&#299;, and I ordered that
after this he should be styled Y&#257;dg&#257;r Beg. I had sent for Jay
Singh, son of R&#257;ja Mah&#257; Singh. On this day he waited on me
and presented an elephant as an offering. A watch and three gharis of
Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba, the 2nd of S&#863;hahriy&#257;r, had passed,
when I rode to look round the N&#299;l-kund and its neighbourhood;
thence I passed on to the plain of the &#703;&#298;d-g&#257;h on the
top of a mound that was very green and pleasant. Champa flowers and
other sweet wild herbs of that plain had bloomed to such a degree that
on all sides on which the eye fell the world looked like a world of
greenery and flowers. I entered the palace when a watch of night had
passed.</p>
<p class="par">As it had been several times mentioned to me that a kind
of sweetmeat was obtained from the wild plantain such that dervishes
and other poor people made it their food, I wished to enquire into the
matter. What I found was that the fruit of the wild plantain was an
exceedingly hard and tasteless thing. The real fact is that in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name=
"pb387">387</a>]</span>lower part (of the trunk) there is a thing
shaped like a fir-cone from which the real fruit of the plantain comes
out. On this a kind of sweetmeat forms which has exactly the juiciness
and taste of <i>p&#257;l&#363;da</i>. It appears that men eat this and
enjoy it.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8354src" href="#xd24e8354" name=
"xd24e8354src">28</a></p>
<p class="par">With regard to carrier pigeons
(<i>kab&#363;tar-i-n&#257;ma-bar</i>), it had been stated to me in the
course of conversation that in the time of the Abbaside Caliphs they
taught<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8374src" href="#xd24e8374" name=
"xd24e8374src">29</a> the Baghdad pigeons who were styled
&lsquo;letter-carriers&rsquo; (<i>n&#257;ma-bar</i>), and were one-half
larger<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8383src" href="#xd24e8383" name=
"xd24e8383src">30</a> than the wild pigeon. I bade the pigeon-fanciers
to teach their pigeons, and they taught some of them in such a manner
that we let them fly from Mandu in the early morning, and if there was
much rain they reached Burhanpur by 2&frac12; pahars (watches) of the
day, or even in 1&frac12; pahars. If the air was very clear most of
them arrived by one pahar of the day and some by four gharis (hours) of
the day.</p>
<p class="par">On the 3rd a letter came from B&#257;b&#257;
K&#863;hurram, announcing the coming of Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n and
R&#257;y R&#257;y&#257;n and the arrival of the ambassadors of
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, and their bringing suitable offerings
of jewels, jewelled things, elephants, and horses, offerings such as
had never come in any reign or time, and expressing much gratitude for
the services and loyalty of the aforesaid K&#863;h&#257;n, and his
faithfulness to his word and duty. He asked for a gracious royal firman
bestowing on him the title of <i>farzand</i> (son) and for other
favours, which had never <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href=
"#pb388" name="pb388">388</a>]</span>yet been vouchsafed in his honour.
Since it was very gratifying to me to please my son, and his request
was reasonable, I ordered that the Munshis of the mercurial pen should
write a farman in the name of &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n,
conveying every kind of affection and favour, and exceeding in his
praise ten or twelve times what had been previously written. They were
ordered in these farmans to address him as farzand. In the body of the
farman I wrote this couplet with my own hand&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;st become, at S&#863;h&#257;h
K&#863;hurram&rsquo;s request,</p>
<p class="line">Renowned in the world as my son&rdquo;
(<i>farzand&#299;</i>).</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">On the 4th day this farman was sent off with its
copy, so that my son S&#863;h&#257;h K&#863;hurram might see the copy
and send off the original. On Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba, the 9th, I
went with the ladies to the house of &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n.
His house was situated in the valley, and was exceedingly pleasant and
bright. It had several valleys round it; in some places there were
flowing waterfalls, and mango and other trees exceedingly green and
pleasant and shady. Nearly 200 or 300 keora shrubs
(<i>gul-i-keo&#7771;&#257;</i>, <i>Pandanus odoratissimus</i>) grew in
one valley. In fine that day passed in great enjoyment. A wine party
was held and cups were presented to the Amirs and intimates, and an
offering from &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n was laid before me. There
were many rare things. I took whatever I approved, and the remainder
was given to him. On the same day K&#863;hw&#257;ja M&#299;r, son of
Sult&#804;&#257;n K&#863;hw&#257;ja, who had come on a summons from
Bangash, waited on me, and presented as an offering a ruby, two pearls,
and an elephant. R&#257;ja Bh&#299;m Nar&#257;yan, a zamindar of the
province of Gadeha, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and
500 horse. An order was given that a jagir should be provided him out
of his native country. On the 12th a letter came from my son
K&#863;hurram that R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Mal, son of R&#257;ja
B&#257;so, whose territory is near the fort of Kangra, had promised
that in the course of a year he would <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb389" href="#pb389" name="pb389">389</a>]</span>bring that fort into
the possession of the servants of the victorious State. He also sent
his letter which covenanted for this. I ordered that after
comprehending his desires and wishes, and satisfying himself with
regard to them, he should send off the Raja to wait on me, so that he
might set about the said duty. On the same day, which was Monday, the
11th, corresponding with the 1st Ramaz&#803;&#257;n (2nd September,
1617), after four gharis and seven pals had passed, a daughter was born
to my son by the mother of his other children, who was the daughter of
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n. This child was named
R&#363;s&#863;han&#257;r&#257; Begam. As the Zamindar of Jaitp&#363;r,
which is in the jurisdiction<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8420src" href=
"#xd24e8420" name="xd24e8420src">31</a> of Mandu, in consequence of
wickedness had not had the felicity of kissing the threshold I ordered
Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n to proceed against him with some
mansabdars and 400 or 500 musketeers and plunder his country. On the
13th one elephant was given to Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n
and one to M&#299;r Q&#257;sim, son of Sayyid Mur&#257;d. On the 16th
Jay Singh, son of R&#257;ja Mah&#257; Singh, who was 12 years old, was
promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and horse. To M&#299;r
M&#299;r&#257;n, son of M&#299;r K&#863;hal&#299;lu-llah, I gave an
elephant which I had myself approved, and another to Mull&#257;
&#703;Abdu-s-Satt&#257;r.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8429src" href=
"#xd24e8429" name="xd24e8429src">32</a> Bhoj, son of R&#257;ja
Bikram&#257;j&#299;t Bhadauriy&#257;, after his father&rsquo;s death,
came from the Deccan and waited on me, and presented 100 muhrs as an
offering. On the 17th it was represented that R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n had
come from the province of Orissa, and proposed to kiss my threshold. As
some unpleasant stories had been told with regard to him, an order was
given that they should hand him over with his son to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name=
"pb390">390</a>]</span>&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n to enquire into
the truth of what had been said about him. On the 19th an elephant was
given to Jay Singh. On the 20th 200 horses were added to the mansab of
Kes&#863;ho D&#257;s M&#257;r&#363;, so that it came, original and
increase, to 2,000 personal and 1,200 horse. On the 23rd, having
distinguished Allah-d&#257;d, the Afghan, with the title of
Ras&#863;h&#299;d K&#863;h&#257;n, I gave him a <i>parm-narm</i>
(shawl). The offering of R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n Singh, consisting of
eighteen elephants, was brought before me; sixteen elephants were
included in my private elephant stud, and I presented him with two. As
the news had arrived from Iraq of the death of the mother of M&#299;r
M&#299;r&#257;n, daughter of S&#863;h&#257;h Isma&#703;&#299;l II, of
the race of the &#7778;afaw&#299; kings, I sent him a dress of honour
and brought him out of the robes of mourning. On the 25th
Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n received a dress of honour, and,
in company with his brother R&#363;hu-llah and other mansabdars,
obtained leave to go to punish the Zamindar of Jaitpur. On the 28th,
having come down from the fort with the intention of seeing the Narbada
and to hunt in its neighbourhood, I took the ladies with me and halted
two stages down on the bank of the river. As there were many mosquitoes
and fleas, I did not stay more than one night. Having come the next day
to T&#257;r&#257;p&#363;r I returned on Friday, the 31st. On the 1st of
the month of Mihr, Muh&#803;sin K&#863;hw&#257;ja, who at this time had
come from Transoxiana, received a dress of honour and 5,000 rupees. On
the 2nd, after enquiry into the matters of R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n, with
regard to which a report had been received, and which &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n had been appointed to investigate, as he appeared
innocent, he enjoyed the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and
presented as an offering 100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees. His offering of a
string of pearls, consisting of eighty pearls and two rubies with a
bracelet with a ruby and two pearls, and the golden figure of a horse
studded with jewels, was laid before <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb391" href="#pb391" name="pb391">391</a>]</span>me. A petition from
Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n arrived stating that when the
victorious army entered the province of Jaitpur the zamindar had
elected to run away. He could not oppose Fid&#257;&#702;&#299;, and his
country was ravaged. He now repented of what he had done, and intended
to come to the Court, which was the asylum of the world, and proffer
service and obedience. A force with R&#363;h&#803;u-llah was sent in
pursuit of him to capture and bring him to Court, or to lay waste and
ruin his domain and imprison his women and dependants, who had gone
into the country of the neighbouring zamindars. On the 8th
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Niz&#804;&#257;m came and laid before me fourteen
pomegranates from the port of Muk&#863;h&#257; (Mocha), which they had
brought to Surat in the space of fourteen days, and in eight days more
to Mandu. The size of these was the same as that of the Thatta
pomegranates. Though the pomegranates of Thatta are seedless and these
have seeds,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8440src" href="#xd24e8440" name=
"xd24e8440src">33</a> yet they are delicate, and in freshness excel
those of Thatta. On the 9th news came that while R&#363;h&#803;u-llah
was passing through the villages, he came to know that the women and
dependants of the Jaitp&#363;r&#299; zamindar were in a certain
village. He remained outside, and sent men into the village to make
enquiries and to bring out the persons who were there. Whilst he was
making enquiries, one of the devoted servants of the zamindar came
along with the villagers. Whilst his men were scattered here and there,
and R&#363;h&#803;u-llah with some servants had brought out his
furniture and was sitting on a carpet, that devoted servant came behind
him and struck him with a spear; the blow was fatal and the spearhead
came out at his breast. The pulling out of the spear and the
reverting<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8446src" href="#xd24e8446" name=
"xd24e8446src">34</a> to his original (dying) of R&#363;h&#803;u-llah
took place together. Those who were present sent that wretch to hell.
All the men who had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href=
"#pb392" name="pb392">392</a>]</span>scattered about put on their
armour and attacked the village. Those doomed men
(<i>k&#863;h&#363;n-giriftah&#257;</i>) had the disgrace of
harbouring<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8458src" href="#xd24e8458" name=
"xd24e8458src">35</a> rebels and sedition-mongers, and were killed in
the course of an astronomical hour. They brought into captivity their
wives and daughters, and, setting fire to the village, made it so that
nothing was seen but heaps of ashes. They then lifted up the body of
R&#363;h&#803;u-llah and went and joined Fid&#257;&#702;&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n. With regard to the bravery and zeal of
R&#363;h&#803;u-llah, there was no dispute; at the most, his
carelessness brought about this turn of fortune. No traces of
habitation remained in that region; the zamindar of that place went
into the hills and jungles and concealed and obliterated himself. He
then sent someone to Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n and begged
for pardon for his offences. An order was given that he should be
allowed quarter and brought to Court.</p>
<p class="par">The mansab of Muruwwat K&#863;h&#257;n was fixed,
original and increase, at 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, on condition
that he should destroy Harbh&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id=

the 13th R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Mal, together with Taq&#299;, the bakhshi
who was in attendance on B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hurram, came and waited
on me. He represented all his requirements. His engagement to perform
the work was approved, and at the request of my son he was honoured
with a standard and drums. To Taq&#299;, who had been appointed with
him, a jewelled <i>khapwa</i> (dagger) was given, and it was arranged
that he should finish his own affairs and start off quickly. The mansab
of K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;Al&#299; Beg M&#299;rz&#257;, who had been
appointed to the defence and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href=

fixed at 5,000 personal and horse. An elephant apiece was given to

Murtaz&#803;&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, and Wal&#299; Beg. On the 17th the
mansab of H&#803;&#257;kim Beg was fixed, original and increase, at
1,000 personal and 200 horse. On the same day, after presenting
R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Mal with a dress of honour, an elephant, and a
jewelled khapwa, and Taq&#299; with a dress of honour, I gave them
leave to proceed on duty to Kangra. When those who had been sent by my
son of lofty fortune, S&#863;h&#257;h K&#863;hurram, with the
ambassadors of &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n and his offerings,
arrived at Burhanpur, and my son&rsquo;s mind was completely satisfied
with regard to the affairs of the Deccan, he prayed for the
Subahdarship of Berar, Khandesh, and Ahmadnagar for the
Commander-in-Chief, the Khankhanan, and sent his son
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n, who is really Khankhanan
junior, with 12,000 cavalry to hold possession of the conquered
provinces. Every place and estate were put as jagirs into the hands of
reliable men, and fitting arrangements were made for the government of
the province. He left, out of the troops that were with him, 30,000
horse and 7,000 musketeer infantry, and took with him the remainder,
amounting to 25,000 horse and 2,000 gunners, and set off to wait on me.
On Thursday (Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba), the 20th<a class="noteref" id=

month of Mihr (Divine month), in the twelfth year from my accession,
corresponding with the 11th S&#863;haww&#257;l, 1026 Hijra (12th
October, 1617), after three watches and one ghari had passed, he
entered the fort of Mandu auspiciously and joyfully, and had the honour
of waiting on me. The duration of our separation was 11<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8479src" href="#xd24e8479" name=
"xd24e8479src">38</a> months and 11 days. After he had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394" name=
"pb394">394</a>]</span>performed the dues of salutation and kissing the
ground, I called him up into the jharokha, and with exceeding kindness
and uncontrolled delight rose from my place and held him in the embrace
of affection. In proportion as he strove to be humble and polite, I
increased my favours and kindness to him and made him sit near me. He
presented 1,000 ashrafis and 1,000 rupees as <i>nazar</i> and the same
amount by way of alms. As the time did not allow of his presenting all
his offerings, he now brought before me the elephant Sarn&#257;k (?)
(snake-head?), that was the chief of the elephants of &#703;&#256;dil
K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s offering, with a casket of precious stones.
After this the bakhshis were ordered to arrange according to their
mansabs the Amirs who had come with my son to pay their respects. The
first who had the honour of audience was K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n.
Sending for him above, I selected him for the honour of kissing my
feet. He presented 1,000 muhrs and 1,000 rupees as nazr, and a casket
filled with jewels and jewelled things as an offering
(<i>p&#299;s&#863;h-kas&#863;h</i>). What was accepted of his offering
was worth 45,000 rupees. After this &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n
kissed the threshold, and presented 100 muhrs as nazr. Then
Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n had the honour of kissing the ground, and
presented an offering of 100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees, with a parcel
(<i>ga&#7789;h&#7771;&#299;</i>)<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8494src"

jewelled vessels, the value of which was 124,000 rupees. Of these one
ruby weighed 11 miskals; an European brought it last year to sell at
Ajmir, and priced it at 200,000 rupees, but the jewellers valued it at
80,000 rupees. Consequently the bargain did not come off, and it was
returned to him and he took it away. When he came to Burhanpur,
Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n bought it from him for 100,000 rupees.

and presented a letter from him. Before this, as a reward for the
conquest of the R&#257;n&#257;, a mansab of 20,000 personal and 10,000
horse was conferred on my son of lofty fortune. When he had hastened to
the capture of the Deccan he had obtained the title of Shah, and now,
in reward for this distinguished service, I gave him a mansab of 30,000
personal and 20,000 horse and bestowed on him the title of
S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n. An order was given that henceforth they
should place a chair in the paradise-resembling assemblies near my
throne for my son to sit upon. This was a special favour for my son, as
it had never been the custom heretofore. A special dress of honour with
a gold-embroidered <i>ch&#257;rqab</i>, with collar, the end of the
sleeves and the skirt decorated with pearls, worth 50,000 rupees, a
jewelled sword with a jewelled <i>pardala</i> (belt), and a jewelled

of gold (coins).<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8518src" href="#xd24e8518"

me, I myself mounted (i.e. drove it) and took it into my private
palace, and scattered a quantity of gold coins on its head,

the 24th, R&#257;ja Bharj&#299;v, Zamindar of Bagl&#257;&#7751;a, came
and waited on me. His name is Part&#257;p; every Raja there has been of
that place they call Bharj&#299;v. He has about 1,500 horse in his pay
(<i>maw&#257;jib-k&#863;hw&#257;r</i>), and in time of need he can
bring into the field 3,000 horse. The province of Bagl&#257;&#7751;a
lies between Gujarat, Khandesh, and the Deccan. It has two strong
forts, S&#257;ler and M&#257;ler (Muler), and as M&#257;ler is in the
midst of a populous country he lives there himself. The country of
Bagl&#257;&#7751;a has pleasant springs and running waters. The mangoes
of that region are very sweet and large, and are gathered for nine
months from the beginning of immaturity<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8533src" href="#xd24e8533" name="xd24e8533src">43</a> until the
end. It has many grapes, but not of the best kinds. The aforesaid Raja
does not drop the thread of caution and prudence in dealing with the
rulers of Gujarat, the Deccan, and Khandesh. He has never gone himself
to see any of them, and if any of them has wished to stretch out his
hand to possess his kingdom, he has remained undisturbed through the
support of the others. After the provinces of Gujarat, the Deccan, and
Khandesh came into the possession of the late king (Akbar),
Bharj&#299;v came to Burhanpur and had the honour of kissing his feet,
and after being enrolled among his servants was raised to the mansab of
3,000. At this time, when S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n went to Burhanpur,
he brought eleven elephants as an offering. He came to Court in
attendance on my son, and in accordance with his friendship and service
was dignified with royal favours, and had presented to him a jewelled
sword, an elephant, a horse, and dress of honour. After some days I
conferred on him three rings of jacinth (<i>y&#257;q&#363;t</i>),
diamond, and ruby. On Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba <span class=

conferred on him dresses of honour of great price, with a
<i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> with embroidered flowers, adorned with rare
pearls, a <i>sarp&#299;ch</i> (turban ornament) decorated with rare
gems, a turban with a fringe of pearls, a waistbelt studded with
pearls, a sword with jewelled <i>pardala</i> (belt), a <i>ph&#363;l
ka&#7789;&#257;ra</i> (dagger), a <i>sada</i> (?) of pearls, with two
horses, one of which had a jewelled saddle, and a special elephant with
two females. In the same way she gave his children and his ladies
dresses of honour, <i>t&#363;quz</i> (nine pieces) of cloth with all
sorts of gold ornaments, and to his chief servants as presents a horse,
a dress of honour, and a jewelled dagger. The cost of this
entertainment was about 300,000 rupees. Presenting on the same day a
horse and dress of honour to &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n and
Sard&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, his brother, I gave them leave to go to
the Sarkar of Kalpi, which had been given them in jagir, and also
dismissed S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n to his jagir, which
was in the Subah of Gujarat, with a dress of honour and an elephant. I
dismissed Sayyid H&#803;&#257;j&#299;, who was a jagirdar of Behar,
with a gift of a horse.</p>
<p class="par">It was frequently reported to me that K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n had become old and weak, so as to be unfit for active duty,
and the Subahs of Kabul and Bangash is a land of disturbance, and to
subdue the Afghans required riding and active movement. Inasmuch as
caution is the condition of rule, I appointed Mah&#257;bat
K&#863;h&#257;n, Subahdar of Kabul and Bangash, giving him a dress of
honour, and promoted K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n to the governorship of
the province of Thatta. Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K&#863;h&#257;n
Fath&#803;-jang had sent as an offering from Behar forty-nine
elephants; these were submitted to me. On this day they brought some
<i>s&#333;na-kela</i> (golden plantains, bananas) for me. I had never
eaten such plantains before. In size they are one finger, and are very
sweet and of good flavour; they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398"
href="#pb398" name="pb398">398</a>]</span>have no resemblance to
plantains of other descriptions, but are somewhat indigestible, so that
from the two that I ate I experienced heaviness, whilst others say they
can eat as many as seven or eight. Though plantains are really unfit to
eat, yet of all the kinds this is the one fit to eat. This year, up to
the 23rd of the month of Mihr, Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n sent Gujarat
mangoes by post (<i>&#7693;&#257;k-chauk&#299;</i>).</p>
<p class="par">On this date I heard that Muh&#803;ammad
Riz&#803;&#257;, ambassador of my brother S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;Abb&#257;s, gave up the deposit of his life at Agra through the
disease of <i>ish&#257;l</i> (diarrh&oelig;a). I made the merchant
Muh&#803;ammad Q&#257;sim, who had come from my brother, his executor,
and ordered that according to the will he should convey his goods and
chattels to the Shah, so that he might grant them in his own presence
to the heirs of the deceased. Elephants and dresses of honour were
conferred on Sayyid Kab&#299;r and Bak&#863;htar K&#863;h&#257;n,
Wakils of &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n. On
Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba, the 13th &#256;b&#257;n, Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
Qul&#299; Beg, Turkm&#257;n, who is dignified with the title of
J&#257;n-sip&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n, came from the Deccan and waited on
me. His father was included among the Amirs of Iran. He had come from
Persia in the time of the late king Akbar, and having a mansab
conferred on him was sent to the Deccan. He was brought up in that
Subah. Although he had been appointed to a duty, yet as my son
S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n came at this time to pay his respects and
represented his sincerity and devotion, I ordered that he should come
post to Court and have the good fortune to wait upon me and then
return. On this day I promoted &#362;d&#257; R&#257;m<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e8577src" href="#xd24e8577" name="xd24e8577src">44</a> to the
rank of 3,000 personal and 1,500 horse. He is a brahmin by caste, and
was much relied on by &#703;Ambar. At the time when
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n went against &#703;Ambar,
&#256;dam K&#863;h&#257;n H&#803;abs&#863;h&#299;, J&#257;d&#363;
R&#257;y, B&#257;b&#363; R&#257;y K&#257;yath, &#362;d&#257; R&#257;m,
and some other Sard&#257;rs of Niz&#804;&#257;mu-l-mulk <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name="pb399">399</a>]</span>left
him and came to S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n. After
&#703;Ambar&rsquo;s defeat they, by the persuasions of &#703;&#256;dil
K&#863;h&#257;n and the deceit of &#703;Ambar, left the right road
again and gave up their loyalty and service. &#703;Ambar took an oath
on the Koran to &#256;dam K&#863;h&#257;n and put him off his guard,
and, capturing him deceitfully, imprisoned him in the fort of
Daulatabad, and at last killed him. B&#257;b&#363; R&#257;y K&#257;yath
and &#362;d&#257; R&#257;m came away and went to the borders of
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s dominions, but he would not
admit them into his territory. About that time B&#257;b&#363; R&#257;y
K&#257;yath lost his life (lit. played away the coin of existence) by
the deceit of his intimates, and &#703;Ambar sent a force against
&#362;d&#257; R&#257;m. He fought well and defeated &#703;Ambar&rsquo;s
army. But afterwards, as he could not remain in that country, he threw
himself on to the borders of the royal dominions, and, having got a
promise, came with his family and dependants and entered the service of
my son S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n. That son distinguished him with
favours and kindnesses of all sorts, and made him hopeful by giving him
a mansab of 3,000 personal and 1,000 horse, and brought him to Court.
As he was a useful servant, I increased this by 500 horse. I also
increased the mansab of S&#863;h&#257;h-b&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n, who
had one of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, by 500 more horse, and gave
him the faujd&#257;rship of the Sarkar of S&#257;rangp&#363;r and a
part of the Subah of Malwa. A special horse and elephant were given to
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n. On Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba (Thursday),
the 10th of the month, my son S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n produced his
own offerings&mdash;jewels and jewelled things and fine cloths and
other rare things. These were all laid out in the courtyard of the
jharokha, and arranged together with the horses and elephants adorned
with gold and silver trappings. In order to please him I came down from
the jharokha and looked through them in detail. Among all these there
was a fine ruby they had bought for my son at the port of Goa for
200,000 rupees; its weight was 19&frac12; tanks, or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name="pb400">400</a>]</span>17
miskals, and 5&frac12; surkhs. There was no ruby in my establishment
over 12 tanks, and the jewellers agreed to this valuation. Another was
a sapphire, among the offerings of &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n; it
weighed 6 tanks and 7 surkhs and was valued at 100,000 rupees. I never
before saw a sapphire of such a size and good colour. Another was the
Chamko&#7771;a diamond, also of &#703;&#256;dil
K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s; its weight was 1 tank and 6 surkhs, which they
valued at 40,000 rupees. The name of Chamko&#7771;a is derived from
this, that there is in the Deccan a plant called
<i>s&#257;g-i-chamko&#7771;a</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8588src"
href="#xd24e8588" name="xd24e8588src">45</a> At the time when
Murtaz&#803;&#257; Niz&#804;&#257;mu-l-mulk conquered Berar he had gone
one day with his ladies round to look at the garden, when one of the
women found the diamond in a chamkora vegetable, and took it to
Niz&#804;&#257;mu-l-mulk. From that day it became known as the Chamkora
diamond, and came into the possession of the present Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n during the interregnum
(<i>fatar&#257;t</i>) of Ahmadnagar. Another was an emerald, also among
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n&rsquo;s offerings. Although it is from
a new mine, it is of such a beautiful colour and delicacy as I have
never before seen. Again, there were two pearls, one of the weight of
64 surkhs, or 2 miskals and 11 surkhs, and it was valued at 25,000
rupees. The other weighed 16 surkhs, and was of exceeding roundness and
fineness. It was valued at 12,000 rupees. Another was a diamond from
the offerings of Qut&#804;bu-l-mull, in weight 1 tank, and valued at
30,000 rupees. There were 150 elephants, out of which three had gold
trappings, chains, etc., and nine had silver trappings. Though
twenty<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8596src" href="#xd24e8596" name=
"xd24e8596src">46</a> elephants were put into my private stud, five
were very large and celebrated. The first, N&#363;r-bak&#863;ht, which
my son presented on the day of meeting, was worth 125,000 rupees. The
second, Mah&#299;pati,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8599src" href=
"#xd24e8599" name="xd24e8599src">47</a> from the offerings of
&#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, was valued <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name="pb401">401</a>]</span>at
100,000 rupees; I gave it the name of Durjans&#257;l. Another, also
from his offerings, was Bak&#863;ht-buland, and valued at 100,000
rupees; I called it Gir&#257;n-b&#257;r. Another was Qadd&#363;s
K&#863;h&#257;n, and the fifth was Im&#257;m Riz&#803;&#257;. They were
from the offerings of Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk. Each of the two was valued at
100,000 rupees. Again, there were 100 Arab and Iraq horses, most of
which were good horses. Of these, three had jewelled saddles. If the
private offerings of my son and those of the rulers of the Deccan were
to be written down in detail, it would be too long a business. What I
accepted of his presents was worth 2,000,000 rupees. In addition to
this he gave his (step-)mother,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8604src"
href="#xd24e8604" name="xd24e8604src">48</a> N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam,
offerings worth 200,000 rupees, and 60,000 rupees to his other mothers
and the Begams. Altogether my son&rsquo;s offerings came to 2,260,000
rupees, or 75,000 tumans of the currency of Iran or 6,780,000 current
T&#363;r&#257;n-kh&#257;n&#299;s. Such offerings had never been made
during this dynasty. I showed him much attention and favour; in fact,
he is a son who is worth grace and kindness. I am very pleased and
satisfied with him. May God Almighty allow him to enjoy long life and
prosperity!</p>
<p class="par">As I had never in my life had any elephant-hunting, and
had a great desire to see the province of Gujarat and to look on the
salt sea, and my huntsmen had often gone and seen wild elephants and
fixed on hunting-places, it occurred to me to travel through Ahmadabad
and look on the sea, and having hunted elephants on my return, when it
was hot and the season for hunting them to go back to Agra. With this
intention I despatched to Agra H&#803;az&#803;rat Maryamu-z-zam&#257;n
(his mother) and the other Begams and people of the harem with the
baggage and extra establishments, and betook myself to a tour in the
Subah of Gujarat to hunt, with such as were indispensable <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402" name="pb402">402</a>]</span>with
me. On the eve of Friday in the month of &#256;b&#257;n (precise date
not given, but apparently the 10th), I marched auspiciously and happily
from Mandu, and pitched on the bank of the tank of N&#257;lchh&#257;.
In the morning I went out to hunt and killed a blue bull with my gun.
On the eve of Saturday, Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n was presented with
a special horse and an elephant, and obtained leave to go to his Subah
of Kabul and Bangash. At his request I conferred on Ras&#863;h&#299;d
K&#863;h&#257;n a robe of honour, a horse, an elephant, and a jewelled
dagger, and appointed him to assist him. I promoted Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
H&#803;usain to the post of bakhshi in the Deccan, and M&#299;rak
H&#803;usain to that of news-writer in the same Subah. R&#257;ja
Kaly&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8614src" href="#xd24e8614"
name="xd24e8614src">49</a> son of R&#257;ja To&#7693;ar Mal, had come
from the Subah of Orissa; on account of some faults which had been
attributed to him he had for some days been forbidden the honour of
paying his respects. After enquiry his innocence appeared clear, and
having given him a dress of honour and a horse, I appointed him to do
duty together with Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n in Bangash. On Monday I
gave the Wakils of &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n jewelled turban
fringes after the fashion of the Deccan, one of the value of 5,000
rupees and the other worth 4,000 rupees. As Afz&#803;al K&#863;h&#257;n
and R&#257;y R&#257;y&#257;n had performed the duties of Wakils to my
son S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n in a becoming manner, I raised them both
in mansab and honoured R&#257;y R&#257;y&#257;n with the title of
Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, which among Hindus is the highest title. In truth
he is a servant worthy of patronage. On Saturday, the 12th, I went to
hunt and shot two female nilgaw. As the hunting-ground was a long way
from this halting-place, I on Monday marched 4&frac12; kos<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8617src" href="#xd24e8617" name=
"xd24e8617src">50</a> and pitched at the village of Kaid H&#803;asan.
On Tuesday, the 15th, I killed three blue bulls, the larger one of
which weighed 12 maunds. On this day M&#299;rz&#257; <span class=

that he had taken aim at a mark and fired his gun. Then he reloaded,
and as his bullet was very flexible, he rested the gun on his chest and
put the bullet between his teeth in order that he might contract it and
put it right. By chance the match reached the pan, and his chest at the
place where the gun was resting was burnt to the extent of the palm of
the hand, and the grains of powder got into his skin and flesh and a
wound was made, and he suffered much pain.<a class="noteref" id=

On Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba (Thursday) I went to look round a hill
valley in which there was a waterfall near the camp. At this season it
had but little water, but as for two or three days they had dammed the
watercourse and, about the time of my reaching the place, let it loose,
it flowed over very well. Its height might be 20 <i>gaz</i>. It
separates at the top of the hill and flows down. In this way it is a
great boon (<i>g&#863;han&#299;mat</i>) on the road. Having enjoyed the
usual cups on the edge of the stream and the shade of the hill, I came
back to the camp at night. On this day the Zamindar of Jaitpur, whose
offences I had forgiven at the request of my son S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n, had the good fortune of kissing the threshold. On Friday,
the 18th, a large blue bull and a bukra, and on Saturday, the 19th, two

H&#803;usain Inj&#363;, who has the title of
&#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daulah, was promoted to the mansab, original and
increase, of 1,000 personal and 400 horse. I presented Y&#257;dg&#257;r
H&#803;usain Q&#363;s&#863;h-begi and Y&#257;dg&#257;r
Q&#363;rch&#299;, who had been appointed to do duty in Bangash, with an
elephant each. On this day some H&#803;usain&#299; grapes without seeds
arrived from Kabul; they were very fresh. The tongue of this suppliant
at the throne of God fails in gratitude for the favours by which,
notwithstanding a distance of three months, grapes from Kabul arrive
quite fresh in the Deccan. On Monday, the 21st, three small blue bulls,
on Tuesday, the 22nd, one blue bull and three cows, and on
Kam-s&#863;hamba (Wednesday), the 23rd, one cow, were killed. On
Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba, the 24th, a feast of cups was held on the
bank of the tank of H&#803;&#257;&#7779;ilp&#363;r. Cups were presented
to my son S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n and some of the great Amirs and
private servants. On Y&#363;suf K&#863;h&#257;n, son of H&#803;usain
K&#863;h&#257;n (Tukriyah), who was of the houseborn ones worthy of
patronage, was bestowed the mansab of 3,000 personal and 1,500 horse,
original and increase, and he was dismissed to the faujd&#257;rship of
Gon&#7693;w&#257;na, dignifying him with a gift of a dress of honour
and an elephant. R&#257;y Bih&#257;r&#299; D&#257;s, the diwan of the
Subah of the Deccan, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. On
Friday J&#257;n-sip&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n was exalted with a standard,
presented with a horse and a dress of honour, and despatched to the
Deccan. This day I made a remarkable shot with a gun. By chance there
was inside the palace a <i>khirn&#299;</i> tree (<i>Mimusops
Kauki</i>). A <i>qur&#299;s&#863;ha</i><a class="noteref" id=

in the midst of it. I fired at it and struck it in the middle of its
breast; from where I stood to the top of the branch was 22 gaz. On
Saturday, the 26th, marching about 2 kos, I pitched at the village of
Kam&#257;lp&#363;r. On this day I shot a blue bull.<a class="noteref"

K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of the principal attendants of my son
S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n, and who had been appointed from Burhanpur
with a body of the royal servants against the zamindars of
Gon&#7693;w&#257;na, having taken a tribute of 110 elephants and
120,000 rupees, came this day to wait upon me. Z&#257;hid, son of
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n, was given the mansab of 1,000
personal and 400 horse, original and increase. On Sunday, the 27th, I
hunted with hawks and falcons. On Monday I killed a large blue bull and
a bukra; the bull weighed 12&frac12; maunds. On Tuesday, the 29th, a
blue bull was killed. Bahl&#363;l Miy&#257;na and Allah-y&#257;r came
from service in Gon&#7693;w&#257;na, and had the good fortune to wait
upon me. Bahl&#363;l K&#863;h&#257;n is the son of H&#803;asan
Miy&#257;na, and Miy&#257;na is an Afghan tribe. In the commencement of
his career Hasan was a servant of &#7778;&#257;diq K&#863;h&#257;n, but
a servant who recognized the king (worthy of a king&rsquo;s service),
and was at last included among the royal servants and died on service
in the Deccan. After his death his sons were granted mansabs. He had
eight sons, and two of them became famous as swordsmen. The elder
brother in his youth gave up the deposit of his life. Bahl&#363;l by
degrees was promoted to the mansab of 1,000. At this time my son
S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n arrived at Burhanpur, and, finding him
worthy of patronage, made him hopeful with a mansab of 1,500 personal
and 1,000 horse. As he had not yet waited on me and was very desirous
to kiss the threshold, I summoned him to Court. He is in truth
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name=
"pb406">406</a>]</span>a good K&#863;h&#257;na-z&#257;da
(household-born one), inasmuch as his heart is adorned with the
perfection of bravery and his exterior is not wanting in good
appearance. The mansab my son S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n had bespoken
for him was granted at his request, and he was honoured with the title
of Sar-buland K&#863;h&#257;n. Allah-y&#257;r Koka was also a brave
youth and a servant worthy of patronage. Finding him fit and suitable
for service in my presence, I sent for him to Court. On
Kam-s&#863;hamba (Wednesday), the 1st of the month of &#256;z&#817;ar,
I went out to hunt and shot a blue bull. On this day the
Kashmir<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8698src" href="#xd24e8698" name=
"xd24e8698src">57</a> reports were laid before me. One was that in the
house of a certain silk-seller two girls were born with teeth, and with
their backs as far as the waist joined together, but the heads, arms,
and legs were separate; they lived a short time and died. On
Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba, the 2nd, on the bank of a tank where my
tents were, a feast of cups was held. Presenting Las&#863;hkar
K&#863;h&#257;n with a dress of honour and an elephant, I promoted him
to the duty of diwan of the Subah of the Deccan, and gave him the
mansab of 2,500 personal and 1,500 horse, original and increase. To
each of the Wakils of &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n two<a class=

star) muhrs, the weight of each of which was 500 ordinary muhrs, were
given. I gave a horse and robe of honour to Sar-buland K&#863;h&#257;n.
As fitting service and approved activity were manifest in
Allah-y&#257;r Koka, I honoured him with the title of Himmat
K&#863;h&#257;n and gave him a dress of honour. On Friday, the 3rd, I
marched 4&frac14; kos and halted the royal standards in the parganah of
Dik&#863;ht&#257;n.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8707src" href=

who was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name=

"#xd24e8717" name="xd24e8717src">60</a> years have passed, and in the
time of the Sultans of Malwa it was for a long time the capital. At the
time when Sult&#804;&#257;n Muh&#803;ammad Tug&#863;hluq was proceeding
to the conquest of the Deccan, he built a fort of cut stone on the top
of a ridge. Outside it is very showy and handsome, but inside the fort
is devoid of buildings. I ordered them to measure its length, breadth,
and height. The length inside the fort was 12 <i>t&#804;an&#257;b</i>,
7 gaz; the breadth, 17 tanab, 13 gaz, and the breadth of the fort wall
19&frac12; gaz. Its height up to the battlements appeared to be
17&frac12; gaz. The length of the outer circuit (?) of the fort was 55
tanabs. &#703;Am&#299;d S&#863;h&#257;h G&#863;hor&#299;, who was
called Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n, and who in the time of
Sult&#804;&#257;n Muh&#803;ammad, son of Sult&#804;&#257;n
F&#299;r&#363;z, king of Delhi, had complete authority over the
province of Malwa, built the J&#257;mi&#703; mosque in the inhabitable
part outside the fort, and opposite the gate of the mosque fixed a
quadrangular iron column. When Sult&#804;&#257;n Bah&#257;dur of
Gujarat took the province of Malwa into his own possession, he wished
to transfer this column to Gujarat. The artificers did not take proper
precautions when they lowered it, and it fell and broke into two
pieces, one of them of 7&frac12; gaz and the other of 4&frac14; gaz.
The column was 1&frac14; gaz round. As it was lying there useless, I
ordered them to take the larger piece to Agra and put<a class="noteref"

the courtyard of the mausoleum of H.M. Akbar, and to burn a lamp on the
top of it at night. The aforesaid mosque has two gates. In front of the
arch of one gate some sentences in prose have been carved on a stone
tablet; their purport is that Am&#299;d S&#863;h&#257;h

<p class="par first">When Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n gave up the
deposit of his life there was no king with full dominion over
Hindustan, and it was a time of confusion. H&#363;s&#863;hang, son of
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n, who was just and possessed of courage,
seeing his opportunity, sat on the throne of sovereignty in Malwa.
After his death through destiny the rule was transferred<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8767src" href="#xd24e8767" name=
"xd24e8767src">65</a> to Mah&#803;m&#363;d K&#863;halj&#299;, son of
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, who had been Vizier to H&#363;s&#863;hang
and passed from him to his son G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n, and
after him to N&#257;&#7779;iru-d-d&#299;n, son of
G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n, who gave his father poison and sat
on the throne of infamy. From him it passed to his son
Mah&#803;m&#363;d. Sult&#804;&#257;n Bah&#257;dur of Gujarat took from
Mah&#803;m&#363;d the province of Malwa. The succession of kings of
Malwa ended with the aforesaid Mah&#803;m&#363;d.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 6th, I went to hunt and shot a female
nilgaw. Presenting an elephant to M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;harafu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain K&#257;s&#863;hg&#863;har&#299;,
I dismissed him to duty in the Subah of Bangash. A present of a
jewelled dagger, a muhr of 100 tolas, and 20,000 darbs was made to
&#362;d&#257; R&#257;m. On Tuesday, the 7th, I shot an alligator in the
tank at Dh&#257;r. Though only the top of his snout was visible and the
rest of his body was hidden in the water, I fired <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name="pb409">409</a>]</span>at a
guess and hit him in his lungs and killed him with a single shot. An
alligator is of the crocodile species and exists in most of the rivers
of Hindustan, and grows very large. This one was not so very big. An
alligator has been seen (by me) 8 gaz long and 1 gaz in breadth. On
Sunday, marching 4&frac12; kos, I halted at Sa&#703;dalp&#363;r. In
this village there is a stream over which N&#257;&#7779;iru-d-d&#299;n
K&#863;halj&#299; built a bridge and erected buildings. It is a place
like K&#257;liy&#257;da, and both are his works. Although his building
is not worthy of praise, yet as it has been built in the river-bed and
they have made rivulets and reservoirs, it is somewhat remarkable. At
night I ordered them to place lamps all round the canals and streams.
On Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba (Thursday), the 9th, a feast of cups was
held. On this day I made a present to my son S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n
of a ruby of one colour, weighing 9 tanks and 5 surkh, of the value of
125,000 rupees, with two pearls. This is the ruby which had been given
to my father at the time of my birth by H&#803;az&#803;rat
Maryam-mak&#257;n&#299;, mother of H.M. Akbar, by way of present when
my face was shown, and was for many years in his <i>sarp&#299;ch</i>
(turban ornament). After him I also happily wore it in my sarpich.
Apart from its value and delicacy, as it had come down as of auspicious
augury to the everlasting State, it was bestowed on my son. Having
raised Mub&#257;riz K&#863;h&#257;n to a mansab of 1,500 personal and
horse, I appointed him to the faujd&#257;rship of the province of
Mew&#257;t, distinguishing him with the present of a dress of honour, a
sword, and an elephant. A sword was given to Himmat K&#863;h&#257;n,
son of Rustam K&#863;h&#257;n. I gave Kam&#257;l K&#863;h&#257;n, the
huntsman, who is one of the old servants and is always present with me
on hunting expeditions, the title of S&#863;hik&#257;r K&#863;h&#257;n
(hunting-K&#863;h&#257;n). Appointing &#362;d&#257; R&#257;m to service
in the Subah of the Deccan, I conferred on him a dress of honour, an
elephant, and Iraq horses (lit. wind-footed ones), and sent with him
for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410" name=
"pb410">410</a>]</span>Commander-in-Chief, Khankhanan, the
&#256;t&#257;l&#299;q, a special gilt dagger
(<i>zar-nis&#863;h&#257;n</i>). On Friday, the 10th, I halted. On
Saturday, the 11th, I marched 3&frac34; kos and halted at the village
of H&#803;alwat.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8782src" href="#xd24e8782"
name="xd24e8782src">66</a> On Sunday, the 12th, marching 5 kos, I
halted in the parganah<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8786src" href=
"#xd24e8786" name="xd24e8786src">67</a> of Badnor. This parganah from
the time of my father had been in the jagir of Kes&#863;ho D&#257;s
M&#257;r&#363;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8795src" href="#xd24e8795"
name="xd24e8795src">68</a> and in fact had become a kind of
<i>wat&#804;an</i> (native country) to him. He had constructed gardens
and buildings. Out of these one was a well (<i>b&#257;ol&#299;</i>)
(step-well probably) on the road, which appeared exceedingly pleasant
and well made. It occurred to me that if a well had to be made anywhere
on a roadside it should be built like this one. At least two such ought
to be made.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 13th, I went to hunt and shot a blue
bull. From the day on which the elephant N&#363;r-bak&#863;ht was put
into the special elephant stables, there was an order that he should be
tied up in the public palace (court). Among animals elephants have the
greatest liking for water; they delight to go into the water,
notwithstanding the winter and the coldness of the air, and if there
should be no water into which they can go, they will take it from a
water-bag (<i>mas&#863;hk</i>) with their trunks and pour it over their
bodies. It occurred to me that however much an elephant delights in
water, and it is suited to their temperament, yet in the winter the
cold water must affect them. I accordingly ordered the water to be made
lukewarm (as warm as milk) before they (the elephants) poured it into
their trunks. On other days when they poured cold water over themselves
they evidently shivered, but with warm water, on the contrary they were
delighted. This usage is entirely my own. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par">On Tuesday, the 14th, marching 6 kos, I halted at
S&#299;lga&#7771;h (Sabalga&#7771;h ?). On Wednesday, the 15th,
crossing the Mah&#299; River, a halt was made near R&#257;mga&#7771;h.
A march of 6 kos was made on Thursday, the 16th, and a halt was made
and a feast of cups held at a waterfall near the camp. Distinguishing
Sar-buland K&#863;h&#257;n with a standard and giving him an elephant,
I dismissed him to do duty in the Deccan. His mansab, original and
increase, was fixed at 1,500 personal and 1,200 horse. R&#257;ja
Bh&#299;m Nar&#257;yan, Zamindar of Gadeha, who had been promoted to
the mansab of 1,000 horse, obtained leave to go to his jagir. Having
raised R&#257;ja Bharj&#299;v, Zamindar of Bagl&#257;&#7751;a, to the
mansab of 4,000, I gave him leave to go to his native country, and an
order was given that when he arrived there he should send to Court his
eldest son, who was his successor, that he might do duty in my
presence. I honoured H&#803;&#257;j&#299; Bal&#363;ch, who was the
chief of the huntsmen and was an active and old servant, with the title
of Bal&#363;ch K&#863;h&#257;n. On Friday, the 17th, marching 5 kos, I
alighted at the village of Dh&#257;vala. On Saturday, the 18th, which
was the feast of Qurb&#257;n, after the Qurb&#257;n rites had been
performed, marching 3&frac14; kos, I halted on the bank of the tank of

This parganah is on the boundary between Malwa and Gujarat. Until I

trees and stony land. On Tuesday, the 21st, I halted. On
Kam-s&#863;hamba (Wednesday), the 22nd, marching 5&frac14; kos, I
halted at the village of Rany&#257;d (Ren&#257;v ?). On Thursday, the

village tank. On Friday, the 24th, marching 2&frac12; kos, the royal
standards were hoisted at the village of J&#257;lot. At this halt some
jugglers from the Carnatic came and showed their tricks. One of them
placed one end of an iron chain, 5&frac12; gaz in length and weighing 1
seer and 2 dams,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8820src" href="#xd24e8820"

the aid of water. It was for a while in his stomach; after this he
brought it up. On Saturday, the 25th, there was a halt. On Sunday, the
26th, marching 5 kos, I alighted at the village of N&#299;mdah. On
Monday, the 27th, also marching 5 kos, I pitched on the bank of a tank.
On Tuesday, the 28th, marching 3&frac34; kos, the royal standards
alighted near the township of Sahr&#257;<a class="noteref" id=

call <i>kumudin&#299;</i>, is of three colours&mdash;white, blue, and

In this tank red flowers were seen blooming. Without doubt it is an

have seen in Kashmir many kanwal with a hundred leaves (petals). It is
certain that it opens during the day and becomes a bud at night. The
kumudini, on the contrary, is a bud during the day and opens at night.
The black bee, which the people of India call
<i>bhau&#7751;r&#257;</i>, always sits on these flowers, and goes
inside them to drink the juice that is in both of them. It often
happens that the kanwal flower closes and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

the whole night. In the same manner it remains in the kumudini flower.
When the flower opens it comes out and flies away. As the black bee is
a constant attendant on these flowers, the poets of India look on it as
a lover of the flower, like the nightingale, and have put into verse
sublime descriptions of it. Of these poets the chief was T&#257;n Sen
Kal&#257;want, who was without a rival in my father&rsquo;s service (in
fact, there has been no singer like him in any time or age). In one of
his compositions he has likened the face of a young man to the sun and
the opening of his eyes to the expanding of the kanwal and the exit of
the bee. In another place he has compared the side-glance of the
beloved one to the motion of the kanwal when the bee alights on it.</p>

with fewer seeds, and one may call them 5 per cent. better. On
Kam-s&#863;hamba, the 29th, and Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba, the 30th, we
halted. At this stage Sar-far&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n came from
Ahmadabad and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Out of his
offerings a rosary of pearls, bought for 11,000 rupees, two elephants,
two horses, two bullocks and a riding cart, and some pieces of
Gujarat&#299; cloth, were accepted, and the remainder presented to him.
Sar-far&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n is a grandson of Mus&#257;h&#803;ib Beg,
by which name he was called by Akbar after his grandfather, who was one
of the Amirs of Hum&#257;y&#363;n. In the beginning of my reign I
increased his mansab and appointed him to the Subah of Gujarat. As he
had an hereditary connection with the Court as a Khana-zada (one born
in the house), he proved himself efficient in the Subah of Gujarat.
Considering him worthy of patronage, I gave him the title of
Sar-far&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n and raised him in the world, and his
mansab has risen to 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. On Friday,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414" name=

the flesh of fish, especially that of the rohu, which is the best kind

M&#257;n. Although the parganah of Dohad is reckoned as within the
boundary of Gujarat, yet, in fact, it was from this stage that all
things appeared different. The open plains and soil are of a different
kind; the people are different and the language of another description.
The jungle that appeared on the road, has fruit-bearing trees, such as
the mango and <i>khirn&#299;</i> and tamarind, and the method of
guarding the cultivated fields is with hedges of <i>zaqq&#363;m</i>.
The cultivators separate their fields with cactus, and leave a narrow
road between them for coming and going. Since all this country has a
sandy soil, when any movement takes place, so much dust rises that the
faces of people are seen with difficulty, so that one should call
Ahmadabad &lsquo;Gard&#257;b&#257;d&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=

on the bank of the Mah&#299;. On Sunday, the 3rd, again after a march
of 3&frac34; kos, I halted at the village of Bardala. At this stage a
number of mansabdars who had been appointed to serve in Gujarat had the
good fortune to kiss the threshold. Marching 5 kos on Monday, the 4th,
the royal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name=

scattered 1,000 rupees. All my mind is bent upon this, that under any
pretext the people of God may be benefited. As the chief way of riding
among the people of this country is in carts, I also wished to travel
in a cart. I sat for 2 kos in a cart, but was much troubled with the
dust, and after this till the end of the stage rode on horseback. On
the road Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n came from Ahmadabad, and had the good
fortune to wait on me, and presented an offering of a pearl he had
bought for 30,000 rupees. On Friday, the 8th, marching 6&frac12; kos,
the place of the descent of prosperity was on the shore of the salt

<p class="par">Cambay<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8909src" href=
"#xd24e8909" name="xd24e8909src">82</a> is one of the old ports.
According to the brahmins, several thousand years have passed since its
foundation. In the beginning its name was Trimb&#257;wat&#299;, and
R&#257;ja Tryambak Kunwar had the government of the country. It would
take too long to write in detail the circumstances of the aforesaid
Raja as the brahmins relate it. In brief, when the turn to the
government came round <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href=
"#pb416" name="pb416">416</a>]</span>to R&#257;ja Abhay
Kum&#257;r,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8914src" href="#xd24e8914" name=
"xd24e8914src">83</a> who was one of his grandsons, by the decree of
heaven a great calamity happened to this city. So much dust and earth
were poured on it that all the houses and buildings were hidden, and
the means of livelihood of many people was destroyed. Before the
arrival of this calamity, an idol (<i>but</i>), which the Raja
worshipped, came in a dream and announced this event. The Raja with his
family embarked in a ship, and carried away the idol with them with a
pillar it had behind it for a support. By chance the ship also was
wrecked by a storm of misfortune. As there was left still a term of
life for the Raja, that pillar bore the boat of his existence in safety
to the shore, and he proposed to rebuild the city. He put up the pillar
as a mark of repopulation and the coming together of the people. As in
the Hindi language they call a pillar <i>istambh</i> and <i>khambh</i>,
they called the city Istambhnagar&#299; and Khamb&#257;wat&#299;, and
sometimes also Trimb&#257;wat&#299;, in connection with the
Raja&rsquo;s name; Khamb&#257;wat&#299; has by degrees and much use
become Khamb&#257;yat (Cambay). This port is one of the largest
ports<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8927src" href="#xd24e8927" name=
"xd24e8927src">84</a> in Hindustan and is near a firth, which is one of
the firths of the Sea of Oman. It has been estimated to be 7 kos in
width, and nearly 40 kos in length. Ships cannot come inside the firth,
but must cast anchor in the port of Gog&#257;, which is a
dependency<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8930src" href="#xd24e8930" name=
"xd24e8930src">85</a> of Cambay and situated near the sea. Thence,
putting their cargoes into <i>ghur&#257;bs</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8935src" href="#xd24e8935" name="xd24e8935src">86</a> (commonly
called &lsquo;grabs&rsquo;) they bring them to the port of Cambay. In
the same way, at the time of loading a ship they carry the cargo in
ghurabs and put it in the ships. Before the arrival of the victorious
host some ghurabs from European ports had come to Cambay to buy and
sell, and were about to return. On Sunday, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name="pb417">417</a>]</span>the
10th, they decorated them and showed them to me. Taking leave they went
about their business. On Monday, the 11th, I myself went on board a
ghurab for about a kos on the face of the water. On Tuesday, the 12th,
I went out with cheetahs (<i>y&#363;z</i>), and captured two<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8947src" href="#xd24e8947" name=
"xd24e8947src">87</a> antelope. On Wednesday, the 13th, I went to see
the tank of T&#257;rangsar (Narangsar?),<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8950src" href="#xd24e8950" name="xd24e8950src">88</a> and passed
through the streets and bazaar on the way, scattering nearly 5,000
rupees. In the time of H.M. Akbar (may Allah&rsquo;s lights be his
testimony), Kaly&#257;n R&#257;y, the superintendent of the port, by
His Majesty&rsquo;s order built a wall of brick and cement round the
city, and many merchants came from various quarters and settled there,
and built fine houses and employed themselves in gaining their
livelihood under easy circumstances. Although its market is small, it
is clean and full of people. In the time of the Sultans of Gujarat the
customs of this port came to a large sum. Now in my reign it is ordered
that they should not take more than one in forty. In other ports,
calling it a tithe, they take one in ten or one in eight, and give all
kinds of trouble to merchants and travellers. In Jeddah, which is the
port of Mecca, they take one in four or even more. One may imagine from
this what the customs of the ports of Gujarat must have come to in the
time of the former rulers. God be praised that this suppliant at the
throne of God obtained the grace to remit the whole of the customs dues
of his dominions, which came to a countless sum, and the very name of
customs (<i>tamg&#863;h&#257;</i>) has passed away from my empire. At
this time an order was given that tankas<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8964src" href="#xd24e8964" name="xd24e8964src">89</a> of gold and
silver should be coined twice the weight of ordinary muhrs and rupees.
The legend <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href="#pb418" name=

&ldquo;Jah&#257;ng&#299;r-s&#863;h&#257;h&#299;, 1027&rdquo; (1618),
and on the reverse &ldquo;Struck in Cambay in the 12th year of the
reign.&rdquo; The legend for silver coins was on one side &ldquo;Sikka,
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r-s&#863;h&#257;h&#299;, 1027&rdquo;; round it this
hemistich, &ldquo;King Jah&#257;ng&#299;r of the conquering ray struck

of Am&#257;nat K&#863;h&#257;n, the superintendent
(<i>muta&#7779;add&#299;</i>) of Cambay, was laid before me in the
women&rsquo;s apartments. His mansab was fixed, original and increase,
at 1,500 personal and 400 horse. N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299; was
honoured with the mansab, original and increase, of 3,000 personal and
600 horse. On Friday, the 15th, mounted on the elephant
N&#363;r-bak&#863;ht, I made it run after a horse. It ran exceedingly
well, and when it was stopped stood well. This is the third time that I
myself have ridden it. On Saturday, the 16th, R&#257;m D&#257;s, son of
Jay Singh<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8993src" href="#xd24e8993" name=

elephant each was given to D&#257;r&#257;b K&#863;h&#257;n. Am&#257;nat
K&#863;h&#257;n, and Sayyid B&#257;yaz&#299;d B&#257;rha. In these few
days during which I was encamped on the shore of the salt sea,
merchants, traders, indigent people, and other inhabitants of the port
of Cambay having been summoned before me, I gave each according to his
condition a dress of honour or a horse or travelling money or
assistance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=

&#7778;&#257;h&#803;ib Sajj&#257;da (Lord of the prayer carpet) of
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam (a mosque near Ahmadabad), the sons of
S&#863;haik&#863;h Muh&#803;ammad G&#863;haus&#804;, S&#863;haik&#863;h
H&#803;aidar, grandson of Miy&#257;n Waj&#299;h&#363;-d-d&#299;n, and
other Shaikhs living at Ahmadabad came to meet me and pay their
respects. As my desire was to see the sea and the flow and ebb of the
water, I halted for ten days, and on Tuesday, the 19th (Day, about 30th
December, 1618), the royal standards started for Ahmadabad. The best
description of fish procurable in this place, the name of which is
<i>&#703;arb&#299;yat</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9008src" href=
"#xd24e9008" name="xd24e9008src">92</a> was caught and frequently
brought for me by the fishermen. Without doubt these fish, are, as
compared with other fish of this country, more delicious and better,
but they are not of the flavour of the roh&#363;. One might say as nine
to ten or even eight to ten. Of the food which is peculiar to the
people of Gujarat there is the <i>khich&#7771;&#299;</i> of
<i>b&#257;jr&#257;</i> (a mixture of split peas and millet boiled
together); this they also call <i>laz&#817;&#299;z&#817;a</i>. It is a
kind of split grain, which does not grow in any other country but
Hindustan, and which in comparison with many other regions of India is
more abundant in Gujarat; it is cheaper than most vegetables. As I had
never eaten it, I ordered them to make some and bring it to me. It is
not devoid of good flavour, and it suited me well. I ordered that on
the days of abstinence, when I partake of dishes not made with flesh,
they should frequently bring me this khichri On the said Tuesday having
marched 6&frac14; kos, I halted at the village of Kos&#257;l&#257;. On
Wednesday, the 20th, I passed through the parganah of
B&#257;br&#257;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9023src" href="#xd24e9023"
name="xd24e9023src">93</a> and halted on the bank of the river. This
was a march of 6 kos. On Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba, the 21st, I halted
and held a feast of cups. In this river I caught many fish, and divided
them among the servants who were present at the feast. On Friday, the
22nd, having moved on 4 kos, I pitched at <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb420" href="#pb420" name="pb420">420</a>]</span>the village of
B&#257;&#7771;&#299;ch&#257;. On this road, walls came in sight from
2&frac12; to 3 <i>gaz</i> in length, and on enquiry it appeared that
people had made them from the desire of spiritual reward. When a porter
is tired on the road he places his burden on the wall and gains his
breath a little, and lifting it up again with ease and without
assistance from anyone proceeds towards his destination. This is one of
the peculiar ideas of the people of Gujarat. The building of these
walls pleased me greatly, and I ordered that in all large
towns<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9032src" href="#xd24e9032" name=
"xd24e9032src">94</a> they should make walls of this kind at the
imperial expense. On Saturday, the 23rd marching 4&frac34; kos, the
camp was pitched at the K&#257;nkr&#299;ya tank. Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n
Muh&#803;ammad, grandson of Sult&#804;&#257;n Ah&#803;mad, the founder
of the city of Ahmadabad, made this tank, and placed round it steps of
stone and cement. In the middle of the tank he constructed a little
garden and some buildings. Between the bank of the tank and these
buildings he had made a causeway, which was the way for entering and
leaving, Since this occurred a long time ago, most of the buildings had
become dilapidated, and there was no place left fit to sit in. At the
time when the host of prosperity was about to proceed towards
Ahmadabad, &#7778;af&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, bakhsh&#299; of Gujarat,
repaired at the expense of government what was broken down and in
ruins, and clearing out the little garden erected a new building in it.
Certainly it is a place exceedingly enjoyable and pleasant. Its style
pleased me. On the side where the causeway is,
Niz&#804;&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n Ah&#803;mad,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e9035src" href="#xd24e9035" name="xd24e9035src">95</a> who was for
a while bakhshi of Gujarat in my father&rsquo;s time, had made a garden
on the bank of the tank. At this time a representation was made to me
that &#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n, in consequence of a dispute that
he had with &#703;&#256;bid, son of Niz&#804;&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n
Ah&#803;mad, cut down the trees of this garden. I also heard that
during his government <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href=
"#pb421" name="pb421">421</a>]</span>he, at a wine party, signed to a
slave, and cut off the head of an unfortunate man who was not wanting
in fun and jesting, merely because in a state of drunkenness he had
uttered some improper expressions by way of a joke. On hearing these
two reports, my sense of justice was shocked, and I ordered the Diwans
to change one thousand of his two-horsed and three-horsed cavalry into
one-horsed, and to deduct from his jagir the difference (of pay), which
came to 7,000,000 dams<span class="corr" id="xd24e9040" title=

<p class="par">As at this stage the tomb of S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;&#256;lam was by the roadside, I recited the
<i>f&#257;tih&#803;a</i> in passing by it. About 100,000 rupees had
been spent in building this mausoleum. S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam
was the son of Qut&#804;b &#703;&#256;lam, and their family goes back
to Mak&#863;hd&#363;m-i-Jah&#257;niy&#257;n<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e9048src" href="#xd24e9048" name="xd24e9048src">96</a> (a saint).
The people of this country, high and low, have a wonderful belief in
him, and they say that S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam used to raise
the dead. After he had raised several dead men, his father became aware
of this and sent him a prohibition, saying it was presumption in him to
meddle with the workshop of God, and was contrary to true obedience. It
happened that S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam had an attendant (female)
who had no children, but at S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam&rsquo;s
prayer God Almighty bestowed a son on her. When he reached his
27th<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9054src" href="#xd24e9054" name=
"xd24e9054src">97</a> year he died, and that slave came weeping and
wailing into his presence, saying, &ldquo;My son has died, and he was
my only son; since God Almighty gave him to me by your favour, I am
hopeful that through your prayer he may become alive.&rdquo;
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam fell into thought for a time and went
into his cell, and the attendant went to his son, who greatly loved
her, and besought him to ask the S&#863;h&#257;h to make his son alive.
The son, who was of tender years, went into his cell, and used much
entreaty. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name=
"pb422">422</a>]</span>S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam said, &ldquo;If
you are content to give up your life for him, perhaps my petition may
be accepted.&rdquo; He represented &ldquo;I am perfectly contented with
what may be your wish and the desire of God.&rdquo; S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;&#256;lam took his son&rsquo;s hands, and lifting him up from the
ground turned his face towards heaven and said, &ldquo;O God, take this
kid in place of that one.&rdquo; Instantaneously the boy surrendered
his soul to God, and S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam laid him down on
his own bed and covered his face with a sheet, and coming out of the
house said to that attendant, &ldquo;Go home, and get news of thy son;
perhaps he may have been in a trance and not have died.&rdquo; When she
arrived at her house she saw her son alive. In short, in the country of
Gujarat they say many things of this sort of S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;&#256;lam. I myself asked Sayyid Muh&#803;ammad, who is lord of
his prayer carpet (in charge of the mausoleum), and who is not wanting
in excellence and reasonableness, what was the real state of the case.
He said, &ldquo;I have also heard the same from my father and
grandfather, and it has come down in succession, and wisdom is from
Allah.&rdquo; Although this affair is beyond the laws of understanding,
yet, as it has attained great notoriety among men, it has been recorded
as a strange occurrence. His departure from this perishable mansion to
the eternal world took place in 880 (1475), in the time of the reign of
Sult&#804;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d B&#299;gara, and the buildings of
this mausoleum are the memorial of T&#257;j K&#863;h&#257;n
Tariy&#257;n&#299;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9059src" href=

<p class="par">As an hour on Monday had been chosen for my entry into
the city, on Sunday, the 24th, I halted. At this place some melons came
from K&#257;riz, which is a town dependent on Herat, and it is certain
that in Khurasan there are no melons better than those of K&#257;riz.
Although <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name=

(caravans) take five months to come, they arrived very ripe and fresh.
They brought so many that they sufficed for all the servants. Together
with these there came oranges (<i>kau&#7751;l&#257;</i>) from Bengal,
and though that place is 1,000 kos distant most of them arrived quite
fresh. As this is a very delicate and pleasant fruit, runners bring by
post as much as is necessary for private consumption, and pass it from
hand to hand. My tongue fails me in giving thanks to Allah for
this.</p>

"xd24e9083src">99</a> Crowds of people, men and women, had assembled,
and were waiting in the streets and bazars and at the gates and the
walls. The city of Ahmadabad did not seem to me so worthy of praise as
I had heard. Although they had made the main road of the bazar wide and
spacious, they had not suited the shops to this breadth. Its buildings
are all of wood and the pillars of the shops slender and mean
(<i>zab&#363;n</i>). The streets of the bazar were full of dust, and
there was dust from the K&#257;nkriy&#257; tank up to the citadel,
which in the dialect of the country they call Bhadar. I hastened along
scattering <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href="#pb424" name=
"pb424">424</a>]</span>money. The meaning of Bhadar is
&lsquo;blessed&rsquo; (<i>bhadra</i>). The houses of the Sultans of
Gujarat, which were inside the Bhadar, have fallen into ruin within the
last fifty or sixty years, and no trace of them is left. However, our
servants who have been sent to the government of this country have
erected buildings. When I was proceeding from M&#257;nd&#363; to
Ahmadabad, Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n had done up the old buildings and
prepared other places for sitting that were necessary, such as a
jharokha, a public audience hall, etc. As to-day was the auspicious day
for the weighing of my son S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n, I weighed him in
the usual manner against gold and other things, and the 27th year from
his blessed birth began in pleasure and enjoyment. I hope that the
Giver of gifts will bestow him on this suppliant at His throne and let
him enjoy life and prosperity. On the same day I gave the province of
Gujarat in jagir to that son. From the fort of M&#257;nd&#363; to the
fort of Cambay, by the road we came, it is 124 kos, which were
traversed in twenty-eight marches and thirty halts. I remained at
Cambay for ten days; from that place to the city of Ahmadabad is 21
kos; which we traversed in five marches with two halts. Altogether,
from M&#257;nd&#363; to Cambay and from Cambay to Ahmadabad by the road
we came is 145 kos, which we accomplished in two months and fifteen
days; this was in thirty-three marches and forty-two halts.</p>
<p class="par">On Tuesday, the 26th, I went to see the J&#257;mi&#703;
mosque, and gave with my own hand in alms to the fakirs who were
present there about 500 rupees. This mosque was one of the memorials of
Sult&#804;&#257;n Ah&#803;mad, the founder of the city of Ahmadabad. It
has three gates,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9102src" href="#xd24e9102"
name="xd24e9102src">100</a> and on each side a bazar. Opposite the gate
that looks towards the east is the mausoleum of the said
Sult&#804;&#257;n Ah&#803;mad. In that dome Sult&#804;&#257;n
Ah&#803;mad, his son Muh&#803;ammad, and his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name=
"pb425">425</a>]</span>grandson Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n are laid to
rest. The length of the court of the mosque, excluding
<i>maq&#7779;&#363;ra</i> (the holy of holies), is 103<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e9110src" href="#xd24e9110" name=
"xd24e9110src">101</a> cubits, and its breadth 89 cubits. Round this
they have made an <i>ayw&#257;n</i> (portico), in breadth 4&frac34;
cubits. The flooring of the court is of trimmed bricks, and the pillars
of the portico of red stone. The maqsura contains 354<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e9117src" href="#xd24e9117" name="xd24e9117src">102</a>
pillars, above which there is a dome. The length of the maqsura is 75
cubits, and its breadth 37 cubits. The flooring of the maqsura, the
<i>mihr&#257;b</i> (arch towards which the face is turned in prayer),
and the pulpit are made of marble. On both sides of the main arch
(<i>p&#299;sh-t&#804;&#257;q</i>) are two polished minarets of cut
stone, containing three <i>&#257;shy&#257;na</i> (stories) beautifully
shaped and decorated. On the right-hand side of the pulpit near the
recess of the maqsura they have made a separate seat for the king. The
space between the pillars has been covered in with a stone platform,
and round this up to the roof of the maqsura they have put stone
cages<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9129src" href="#xd24e9129" name=
"xd24e9129src">103</a> (in which women sit so as not to be seen). The
object of this was that when the king came to the Friday service or the
&#703;&#298;d he went up there with his intimates and courtiers, and
performed his devotions. This in the dialect of the country they call
the Mul&#363;k-k&#863;h&#257;na (King&rsquo;s chamber). This practice
and caution were on account of the crowding of the people. Truly this
mosque is a very noble building.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9134src"

<p class="par">On Wednesday,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9139src" href=
"#xd24e9139" name="xd24e9139src">105</a> the 27th, I went to the
monastery of S&#863;haik&#863;h Waj&#299;hu-d-d&#299;n, which was near
the palace, and the <i>f&#257;tih&#803;a</i> was read at the head of
his shrine, which is in the court of the monastery. &#7778;&#257;diq
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of the chief Amirs of my father, built
this monastery. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426"
name="pb426">426</a>]</span>The Shaikh was a successor of
S&#863;haik&#863;h Muh&#803;ammad G&#863;haus&#804;,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e9147src" href="#xd24e9147" name="xd24e9147src">106</a> but a
successor against whom the teacher disputed.
Waj&#299;hu-d-d&#299;n&rsquo;s loyalty to him is a clear proof<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e9150src" href="#xd24e9150" name=
"xd24e9150src">107</a> of the greatness of S&#863;haik&#863;h
Muh&#803;ammad G&#863;haus&#804;. S&#863;haik&#863;h
Waj&#299;hu-d-d&#299;n was adorned with visible excellencies and
spiritual perfection. He died thirty years ago in this city
(Ahmadabad), and after him S&#863;haik&#863;h &#703;Abdu-llah,
according to his father&rsquo;s will, took his place. He was a very
ascetic dervish. When he died his son S&#863;haik&#863;h Asadu-llah sat
in his place, and also quickly went to the eternal world. After him his
brother S&#863;haik&#863;h H&#803;aidar became lord of the prayer
carpet, and is now alive, and is employed at the grave of his father
and grandfather in the service of dervishes and in looking after their
welfare. The traces of piety are evident on the forehead of his life.
As it was the anniversary festival of S&#863;haik&#863;h
Waj&#299;hu-d-d&#299;n, 1,500 rupees were given to S&#863;haik&#863;h
H&#803;aidar for the expenses of the anniversary, and I bestowed 1,500
rupees more on the band of fakirs who were present in the monastery,
with my own hand in charity, and made a present of 500 rupees to the
grandson (?) of S&#863;haik&#863;h Waj&#299;hu-d-d&#299;n. In the same
way I gave something for expenses, and land to each of his relatives
and adherents according to his merit. I ordered S&#863;haik&#863;h
H&#803;aidar to bring before me the body of dervishes and deserving
people who were associated with him, in order that they might ask for
money for expenses and for land. On Thursday, the 28th, I went to look
round the Rustam-K&#863;h&#257;n-b&#257;&#7771;&#299;, and scattered
1,500 rupees on the road. They call a garden a
<i>b&#257;&#7771;&#299;</i> in the language of India. This is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name=
"pb427">427</a>]</span>a garden that my brother S&#863;h&#257;h
Mur&#257;d made in the name of his son Rustam. I made a Thursday
entertainment in this garden, and gave cups to some of my private
servants. At the end of the day I went to the little garden of the
<i>h&#803;aw&#257;l&#299;</i> (mansion) of S&#863;haik&#863;h Sikandar,
which is situated in the neighbourhood of this garden, and which has
exceedingly good figs. As picking the fruit with one&rsquo;s own hand
gives it quite a different relish, and I had never before plucked figs
with my own hand, their excellence in this respect was approved.
S&#863;haik&#863;h Sikandar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9165src" href=
"#xd24e9165" name="xd24e9165src">108</a> is by origin a Gujarati, and
is not wanting in reasonableness, and has complete information about
the Sultans of Gujarat. It is now eight or nine years since he has been
employed among the servants (of the State). As my son S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n had appointed to the government of Ahmadabad Rustam
K&#863;h&#257;n, who is one of his chief officers, at his request I, in
accordance with the association of his name, presented him with (the
garden) Rustam-b&#257;&#7771;&#299;. On this day R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n,
zamindar of the province of &#298;&#7693;ar, had the good fortune to
kiss my threshold, and presented an elephant and nine horses as an
offering; I gave him back the elephant. He is one of the most
considerable zamindars on the frontier of Gujarat, and his country is
close to the hill-country of the R&#257;n&#257;. The Sultans of Gujarat
constantly sent armies against the Raja of that place. Although some of
them have professed obedience and presented offerings, for the most
part none of them have come to see anyone personally. After the late
king Akbar conquered Gujarat, the victorious army was sent to attack
him. As he understood that his deliverance lay in obedience and
submission, he agreed to serve and be loyal, and hastened to enjoy the
good fortune of kissing the threshold. From that date he has been
enrolled among the servants (of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb428" href="#pb428" name="pb428">428</a>]</span>State). He comes to
see whoever is appointed to the government of Ahmadabad, and when work
and service are necessary appears with a body of his men. On Saturday,
the 1st of the month of Bahman, in the 12th year of my reign, Chandar
Sen, who is one of the chief zamindars of this country, had the good
fortune to kiss the threshold, and presented an offering of nine
horses. On Sunday, the 2nd, I gave elephants to R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n,
zamindar of &#298;&#7693;ar, to Sayyid Mu&#7779;t&#804;af&#257;, and
M&#299;r F&#257;z&#803;il. On Monday I went out hawking, and scattered
nearly 500 rupees on the road. On this day pears came from Badakhshan.
On Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba, the 6th, I went to see the &ldquo;garden
of victory&rdquo; at the village of Sair-khaiz (Sarkhej), and scattered
1,500 rupees on the way. As the tomb of S&#863;haik&#863;h Ah&#803;mad
K&#863;ha&#7789;&#7789;&#363;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9170src" href=
"#xd24e9170" name="xd24e9170src">109</a> is on the road, I first went
there and the <i>f&#257;tih&#803;a</i> was read.
K&#863;ha&#7789;&#7789;&#363; is the name of a town in the Sarkar of
N&#257;gor, and was the birthplace of the Shaikh.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e9177src" href="#xd24e9177" name="xd24e9177src">110</a> The Shaikh
lived in the time of Sult&#804;&#257;n Ah&#803;mad, who founded the
city of Ahmadabad, and the latter had a great respect for him. The
people of this country have a strange belief in him, and consider him
one of the great saints. Every Friday night a great crowd of people,
high and low, go to visit his shrine. Sult&#804;&#257;n Muh&#803;ammad,
son of the aforesaid Sult&#804;&#257;n Ah&#803;mad, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429" name=
"pb429">429</a>]</span>built lofty buildings in the shape of
mausoleums, mosques, and monasteries at the head of his tomb, and near
his mausoleum on the south side made a large tank, and surrounded it
with stone and lime (masonry). This building was completed in the time
of Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n, son of the aforesaid Muh&#803;ammad. The
shrines of several of the Sultans of Gujarat are on the bank of the
tank by the feet of the Shaikh. In that dome there have been laid at
rest Sult&#804;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d B&#299;gara, Sult&#804;&#257;n
Muz&#804;affar, his son, and Mah&#803;m&#363;d, the martyr, grandson of
Sult&#804;&#257;n Muz&#804;affar, and who was the last of the Sultans
of Gujarat. B&#299;gara, in the language of the people of Gujarat,
signifies &lsquo;turned-up moustache,&rsquo; and Sult&#804;&#257;n
Mah&#803;m&#363;d had a large turned-up moustache; on this account they
call him B&#299;gara. Near his (S&#863;haik&#863;h
K&#863;ha&#7789;&#7789;&#363;&rsquo;s) tomb is the dome of his
ladies.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9188src" href="#xd24e9188" name=
"xd24e9188src">111</a> Without doubt the mausoleum of the Shaikh is a
very grand building and a beautiful place. It is estimated that 500,000
rupees were spent on it. God only knows what is true.</p>
<p class="par">After performing this visitation I went to
Fath&#803;-b&#257;g&#863;h (garden of victory). This garden is situated
on the ground on which the Commander-in-Chief,
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n &#256;t&#257;l&#299;q fought with
and defeated Nab&#363; (Nann&#363;? Nanh&#363;?), who gave himself the
title of Muz&#804;affar K&#863;h&#257;n. On this account he called it
B&#257;g&#863;h-i-fath&#803;; the people of Gujarat call it
Fath&#803;-b&#257;&#7771;&#299;. The details of this are that when, by
means of the good fortune of the late king Akbar, the country of
Gujarat was conquered, and Nab&#363; fell into his hands,
I&#703;tim&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n represented that he was the son of a
carter. As no son was left by Sult&#804;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d, and
moreover there was no one of the descendants of the Sultans of Gujarat
whom he could raise to the throne, he (I&#703;tim&#257;d) had accepted
the most available course, and had made out that this was the son of
Mah&#803;m&#363;d. He gave him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb430"
href="#pb430" name="pb430">430</a>]</span>the name of Sult&#804;&#257;n
Muz&#804;affar, and raised him to the sovereignty. Men from necessity
consented to this. As His Majesty considered the word of
I&#703;tim&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n of weight, he ignored Nab&#363;, and
for some time he did duty among the servants, and the king paid no
attention to his case. In consequence of this he ran away from
Fath&#803;p&#363;r, and coming to Gujarat lived for some years under
the protection of the zamindars. When S&#863;hih&#257;bu-d-d&#299;n
Ah&#803;mad K&#863;h&#257;n was turned out from the government of
Gujarat and I&#703;tim&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n installed in his place, a
body of the servants of S&#863;hih&#257;bu-d-d&#299;n K&#863;h&#257;n,
who were attached to Gujarat, separated from him, and remained at
Ahmadabad in the hope of service with I&#703;tim&#257;d. After
I&#703;tim&#257;d entered the city they had recourse to him, but had no
good luck with him. They had not the face to go to
S&#863;hih&#257;bu-d-d&#299;n, and had no prospects in Ahmadabad. As
they were without hope they thought their remedy lay in betaking
themselves to Nab&#363;, and in making him an excuse for disturbance.
With this intent 600 or 700 horsemen from among them went to Nab&#363;
and carried him off along with Lon&#257; K&#257;th&#299;, under whose
protection he was living, and proceeded to Ahmadabad. When he arrived
near the city many wretched men on the look out for an occasion joined
him, and nearly 1,000 horsemen, Mughals and Gujaratis, collected
together. When I&#703;tim&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n became aware of this
he left his son S&#863;h&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n in the city, and
hastened off in search of S&#863;hih&#257;b K&#863;h&#257;n, who was
proceeding towards the Court, in order that with his help he might
quiet the disturbance. Many of the men had separated themselves from
him, and he read on the faces of those who were left the signs of
unfaithfulness, but S&#863;hih&#257;bu-d-d&#299;n, in company with
I&#703;tim&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n, turned his rein. It happened that
before their arrival Nab&#363; had entered the fort of Ahmadabad. Those
who were loyal drew up their troops near the city, and the rebels came
out of the fort and hastened to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb431" href="#pb431" name="pb431">431</a>]</span>battlefield. When the
army of the rebels showed itself, those of the servants of
S&#863;hih&#257;b K&#863;h&#257;n who were left took the wrong road and
joined the enemy. S&#863;hih&#257;b K&#863;h&#257;n was defeated and
hastened towards Pa&#7789;an (P&#257;tan?), which was in the possession
of the royal servants. His retinue and camp were plundered, and
Nab&#363;, bestowing mansabs and titles on the rebels, went against
Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n Muh&#803;ammad K&#863;h&#257;n, who was in
Baroda. The servants of the latter, like the servants of
S&#863;hih&#257;b K&#863;h&#257;n, took the road of faithlessness and
chose separation, as is related in detail in the Akbar-n&#257;ma. In
the end, after giving his word to Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n
Muh&#803;ammad, he sent him to martyrdom, and his goods and property,
which were equal to the treasure of his courtesy and grandeur, were
plundered. Nearly 45,000 horsemen collected round Nab&#363;.</p>
<p class="par">When this state of affairs was represented to H.M. Akbar
he sent against him M&#299;rz&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Bair&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, with a force of brave warriors. On the day when
M&#299;rz&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n arrived near the city, he drew up the
ranks of good fortune. He had about 8,000 or 9,000 horse, and Nab&#363;
met him with 30,000, and drew up his host tainted with ruin. After
prolonged fighting and slaughter the breeze of victory blew on the flag
of the loyal, and Nab&#363;, being defeated, fled in wretched plight.
My father, in reward for this victory, gave M&#299;rz&#257;
K&#863;h&#257;n a mansab of 5,000 with the title of
K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n and the government of the country
of Gujarat. The garden that K&#863;h&#257;nk&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n made
on the field of battle is situated on the bank of the River
S&#257;barmat&#299;. He founded lofty buildings along that eminence on
the river, and made a strong wall of stone and cement round the garden.
The garden contains 120 <i>jar&#299;b</i> of land, and is a charming
resort. It may have cost 200,000 rupees. It pleased me greatly. One may
say that in the whole of Gujarat there is no garden like this.
Arranging a Thursday feast, I bestowed cups on my private servants, and
remained there for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb432" href=
"#pb432" name="pb432">432</a>]</span>night. At the end of the day, on
Friday, I entered the city, scattering about 1,000 rupees on the road.
At this time the gardener represented that a servant of Muqarrab
K&#863;h&#257;n had cut down some <i>champ&#257;</i> trees above the
bench alongside the river. On hearing this I became angry, and went
myself to enquire into the matter and to exact satisfaction. When it
was established that this improper act had been committed by him, I
ordered both his thumbs to be cut off as a warning to others. It was
evident that Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n knew nothing of this affair, or
otherwise he would have punished him there and then. On Tuesday, the
11th, the Kotwal of the city caught a thief and brought him. He had
committed several thefts before, and each time they had cut off one of
his members; once his right hand, the second time the thumb of his left
hand, the third time his left ear, and fourth time they hamstringed
him, and the last time his nose; with all this he did not give up his
business, and yesterday entered the house of a grass-seller in order to
steal. By chance the owner of the house was on the look out and seized
him. The thief wounded the grass-seller several times with a knife and
killed him. In the uproar and confusion his relatives attacked the
thief and caught him. I ordered them to hand over the thief to the
relatives of the deceased, that they might retaliate on him.</p>

<p class="par first">On Wednesday, the 12th, 3,000 rupees were handed
over to &#703;Az&#804;amat K&#863;h&#257;n and Mu&#703;taqad
K&#863;h&#257;n, that they might go the next day to the tomb of
S&#863;haik&#863;h Ah&#803;mad K&#863;ha&#7789;&#7789;&#363;, and
divide it among the fakirs and indigent people who had taken up their
abode there. On Thursday, the 13th, I went to the lodging of my son
S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n, and held a Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba
entertainment there, and distributed cups among my private servants. I
gave my son the elephant Sundar Mathan,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e9222src" href="#xd24e9222" name="xd24e9222src">112</a> which was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href="#pb433" name=
"pb433">433</a>]</span>superior to all my private elephants in speed
and beauty and pleasant paces, and competed with horses, and was the
first among the elephants, and one much liked by King Akbar. My son
S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n had a great liking for him, and frequently
asked him of me, and seeing no way out of it I gave it to him with its
gold belongings of chains, etc., together with a female elephant. A
present of 100,000 of darbs was given to the wakils of &#703;&#256;dil
K&#863;h&#257;n. At this time it was represented<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e9227src" href="#xd24e9227" name="xd24e9227src">113</a> to me that
Mukarram K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Mu&#703;az&#804;z&#804;am
K&#863;h&#257;n, who was the governor of Orissa, had conquered the
country of K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;, and that the Raja of that place had
fled and gone into the R&#257;jmahendra. As he was a
<i>k&#863;h&#257;na-z&#257;d</i> (houseborn one) and worthy of
patronage, I ordered his mansab, original and increase, to be 3,000
personal and 2,000 horse, and honoured him with drums, a horse, and a
dress of honour. Between the province of Orissa and Golconda there were
two zamindars, one the Raja of K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257; and the second
the Raja of R&#257;jmahendra. The province of K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;
has come into the possession of the servants of the Court. After this
it is the turn of the country of R&#257;jmahendra. My hope in the grace
of Allah is that the feet of my energy may advance farther. At this
time a petition from Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk reached my son S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n to the effect that as the boundary of his territory had
approached that of the King, and he owed service to this Court, he
hoped an order would be issued to Mukarram K&#863;h&#257;n not to
stretch out his hand, and to acquire possession of his country. It was
a proof of Mukarram&rsquo;s valour and energy that such a one as
Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk should be apprehensive about his (Mukarram) becoming
his neighbour.</p>
<p class="par">On this day Ikr&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n, son of
Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n, was appointed faujd&#257;r of
Fath&#803;p&#363;r and its neighbourhood, and presented with a dress of
honour and an elephant; Chandar <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434"

Haloz&#817; (Halwad?),<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9237src" href=
"#xd24e9237" name="xd24e9237src">114</a> was given a dress of honour, a
horse, and an elephant. An elephant was also given to L&#257;ch&#299;n
Q&#257;qs&#863;h&#257;l. At the same time Muz&#804;affar,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e9240src" href="#xd24e9240" name=
"xd24e9240src">115</a> son of M&#299;rz&#257; B&#257;q&#299;
Tark&#863;h&#257;n, had the honour of kissing the threshold. His mother
was the daughter of B&#257;rha (Bh&#257;r&#257;), the zamindar of
Kachh. When M&#299;rz&#257; B&#257;q&#299; died and the government of
Thatta went to M&#299;rz&#257; J&#257;n&#299;, Muz&#804;affar was
apprehensive of M&#299;rz&#257; J&#257;n&#299;, and he took refuge with
the aforesaid zamindar. He had remained from his childhood until now in
that country. Now that the fortunate retinue had reached Ahmadabad, he
came and did homage. Though he had been reared among men of the wilds,
and was unfamiliar with civilized ways and ceremonies, yet as his
family had had the relations of service with our exalted dynasty from
the times of Timur<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9243src" href=
"#xd24e9243" name="xd24e9243src">116</a>&mdash;may God make his proof
clear!&mdash;I considered it right to patronize him. For the present I
gave him 2,000 rupees for expenses, and a dress of honour. A suitable
rank will be given to him, and perhaps he will show himself efficient
as a soldier.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 20th, I went to the &ldquo;Garden of
Victory,&rdquo; and contemplated the red roses. One plot had bloomed
well. There are not many red roses (<i>gul-i-surk&#863;h</i>) in this
country, so it was pleasant to see so many here. The anemone<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e9257src" href="#xd24e9257" name=
"xd24e9257src">117</a> bed, too, was not bad, and the figs had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name=
"pb435">435</a>]</span>ripened. I gathered some figs with my own hands,
and weighed the largest one. It came to 7&frac12; tolas. On this day
there arrived 1,500 melons from K&#257;r&#299;z. The K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam had sent them as a present. I gave a thousand of them
to the servants in attendance, and five hundred to the women of the
harem. I spent four days in this garden in enjoyment, and on Monday
eve, the 24th, I came to the city. Some of the melons were given to the
Shaikhs of Ahmadabad, and they were astonished to see how inferior were
the Gujarat melons. They marvelled at the goodness of the Deity.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 27th, I held a wine-feast in the
Nag&#299;na<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9266src" href="#xd24e9266" name=
"xd24e9266src">118</a> garden, which is inside the palace grounds, and
which one of the Gujarat Sultans had planted. I made my servants happy
with flowing bowls. A pergola (<i>tak&#863;hta</i>) of grapes had
ripened in this garden, and I bade those who had been drinking to
gather the bunches with their own hands and partake of them.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 1st of Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;, I left
Ahmadabad and marched towards Malwa. I scattered money on the road till
we reached the bank of the K&#257;nkriy&#257; tank, where I halted for
three days. On Thursday, the 4th, the presents of Muqarrab
K&#863;h&#257;n were laid before me. There was nothing rare among them,
nor anything that I took a fancy to, and so I felt ashamed. I gave them
to my children to take into the harem. I accepted jewellery and
decorated vessels and cloths to the value of a lakh, and gave him back
the rest. Also about one hundred Kachhi horses were taken, but there
was none of great excellence.</p>
<p class="par">On Friday, the 5th, I marched 6 kos, and encamped on the
bank of the Ahmadabad River. As my son S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n was
leaving Rustam K&#863;h&#257;n, one of his chief servants, in charge of
the government of Gujarat, I, at my son&rsquo;s request, gave him a
standard, drums, a dress <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href=
"#pb436" name="pb436">436</a>]</span>of honour, and a decorated dagger.
Up till now it had not been the custom in this dynasty to give to the
prince&rsquo;s servants standards or drums. For instance, H.M. Akbar
with all his affection and graciousness to me, did not decide upon
giving to my officers a title or a standard. But my consideration for
this son is so unbounded that I would do anything to please him, and,
in fact, he is an excellent son, and one adorned with every grace, and
in his early youth has accomplished to my satisfaction, everything that
he has set his hand to.</p>
<p class="par">On this day Muqarrab K&#863;h&#257;n took leave to go to
his home.</p>
<p class="par">As the shrine of Qut&#804;b &#703;&#256;lam, the father
of S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#299;, was in the
village of Batoh,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9285src" href="#xd24e9285"
name="xd24e9285src">119</a> and on my way, I went there and gave 500
rupees to the guardians. On Saturday, the 6th, I entered a boat on the
Mahm&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d River and went a-fishing. On the bank is the
tomb of Sayyid Mub&#257;rak Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#299;. He was one of the
leading officers of Gujarat, and his son Sayyid M&#299;r&#257;n erected
this monument to him. It is a very lofty cupola, and there is a very
strong wall of stone and lime round it. It must have cost more than two
lakhs of rupees. None of the tombs of the Gujarat Sultans that I saw
came up to one-tenth of it. Yet they were sovereigns, and Sayyid
M&#299;r&#257;n was only a servant. Genius and the help of God have
produced this result. A thousand blessings on a son who has made such a
tomb for his father:<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9288src" href=

<p class="par first">On Sunday I halted and fished, and caught 400
fish. One of them had no scales, and is called the
<i>sang-m&#257;h&#299;</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href=
"#pb437" name="pb437">437</a>]</span>&lsquo;the stone-fish.&rsquo; Its
belly was very large and swollen, so I ordered them to cut it open in
my presence. Inside was a fish with scales which it had recently
swallowed and which had as yet undergone no change. I told them to
weigh both fish. The stone-fish came to 6&frac12; seers and the other
to nearly 2.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 8th, I marched 4&frac14; kos, and
encamped in the village of Moda (Mah&#257;ondat). The inhabitants
praised the rainy season of Gujarat. It happened that on the previous
night and on this day before breakfast some rain fell, and the dust was
laid. As this is a sandy country, it is certain that there would not be
any dust in the rainy season, nor would there be any mud. The fields
would be green and cheerful. At any rate, a specimen of the rainy
season has been seen by me. On Tuesday I marched 5&frac12; kos, and
halted at the village of Jars&#299;ma (Jar&#299;sam&#257;).<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e9303src" href="#xd24e9303" name=
"xd24e9303src">121</a></p>
<p class="par">At this stage news came that M&#257;n Singh
Sew&#7771;&#257; had surrendered his soul to the lords of hell. The
account of this in brief is that the Sewras<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e9309src" href="#xd24e9309" name="xd24e9309src">122</a> are a
tribe of infidel Hindus who always go with their head and feet bare.
One set of them root out their hair, their beards, and moustaches,
while another set shave them. They do not wear sewn garments, and their
central principle is that no living creature should be injured. The
Banyans regard them as their <i>p&#299;rs</i> and teachers, and even
worship them. There are two sects of Sewras, one called Pat&#257;
(Tap&#257;) and the other Kanthal (Kartal). M&#257;n Singh was the head
of the latter, and B&#257;l Chand the head of the Pat&#257;s.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e9315src" href="#xd24e9315" name=
"xd24e9315src">123</a> Both of them used to attend upon H.M. Akbar.
When he died and K&#863;husrau fled and I pursued him, R&#257;y Singh
Bhur&#7789;iy&#257;, zamindar of Bikanir, who had been made an
Am&#299;r by Akbar&rsquo;s kindness, asked M&#257;n Singh what
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href="#pb438" name=
"pb438">438</a>]</span>would be the duration of my reign and the
chances of my success. That black-tongued fellow, who pretended to be
skilled in astrology and the extraction of judgments, said to him that
my reign would, at most, last for two years. The doting old idiot
(R&#257;y Singh) relied upon this, and went off without leave to his
home. Afterwards, when the glorious God chose out this suppliant and I
returned victorious to the capital, he came, ashamed and downcast, to
Court. What happened to him in the end has been told in its proper
place.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9320src" href="#xd24e9320" name=
"xd24e9320src">124</a> In fine, M&#257;n Singh, in the course of three
or four months, was struck with leprosy (<i>juz&#817;&#257;m</i>), and
his limbs fell off him till he was in such a state that death was by
many degrees preferable to life. He was living at Bikanir, and now I
remembered him and sent for him. On the road he, out of excessive fear,
took poison, and surrendered his soul to the lords of hell. So long as
the intentions of this suppliant at God&rsquo;s courts are just and
right, it is sure that whoever devises evil against me will receive
retribution according to his merits.</p>
<p class="par">The sect of the Sewras exists in most of the cities of
India, but is especially numerous in Gujarat. As the Banyans are the
chief traders there, consequently the Sewras also are plentiful.
Besides making idol-temples for them, they have built houses for them
to dwell in and to worship in. In fact, these houses are the
headquarters of sedition. The Banyans send their wives and daughters to
the Sewras, who have no shame or modesty. All kinds of strife and
audacity are perpetrated by them. I therefore ordered that the Sewras
should be expelled, and I circulated farmans to the effect that
wherever there were Sewras in my empire they should be turned out.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href="#pb439" name=

<p class="par">On Wednesday, the 10th, I went out to hunt, and shot two
nilgaw, one male and one female. On this day the son of Dil&#257;war
K&#863;h&#257;n came from Pattan, which was his father&rsquo;s fief,
and paid his respects. He presented a Kachh&#299; horse. It was a very
handsome animal, and pleasant to ride. Till I came to Gujarat no one
had presented me with so fine a horse. Its value was 1,000 rupees.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 11th, I had a wine party on the bank of
the tank, and bestowed many favours on those servants who had been
appointed to the province, and then dismissed them. Among the
promotions was that of S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K&#863;h&#257;n, the
Arab, to the rank of 2,500 personal and 2,000 horse. I also gave him
drums, a horse, and a robe of honour. Himmat K&#863;h&#257;n was raised
to the rank of 1,500 with 800 horse, and had a robe of honour and an
elephant. Kif&#257;yat K&#863;h&#257;n, who was made Diwan of the
province, received the rank of 1,200 with 300 horse. &#7778;af&#299;
K&#863;h&#257;n bakhshi received a horse and a robe of honour.
K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;&#256;qil had the rank of 1,500 with 650 horse,
and was made bakhshi of the Ahadis, and had the title of
&#703;&#256;qil K&#863;h&#257;n. Thirty thousand darbs were given to
the wakil of Qut&#804;bu-l-Mulk, who had brought the tribute.</p>
<p class="par">On this day my son S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n presented
pomegranates and quinces that had been sent to him from Far&#257;h. I
had never seen such large ones, and I ordered them to be weighed. The
quince weighed 29 tolas 9 mashas and the pomegranate 40&frac12; tolas.
On Friday, the 12th, I went a-hunting and shot two nilgaw, a male and a
female. On Saturday, the 13th, I shot three nilgaw, two males and one
female. On Sunday, the 14th, I gave S&#863;haik&#863;h
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l, the son of S&#863;haik&#863;h Muh&#803;ammad
G&#863;haus&#804;, a robe of honour and 500 rupees. On Monday, the
15th, I went a-hunting and shot two female nilgaw. On Tuesday, the
16th, I again presented the Shaikhs of Gujarat, who were in attendance,
with robes of honour and maintenance-lands. To each of them I gave a
book from my special <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href="#pb440"
name="pb440">440</a>]</span>library, such as the
Tafs&#299;r-i-kas&#863;hs&#863;h&#257;f,<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">At the time that Ahmadabad was adorned by the setting up
of the royal standards my employment by day and by night was the seeing
of necessitous persons and the bestowing on them of money and land. I
directed S&#863;haik&#863;h Ah&#803;mad the &#7778;adr and some other
tactful servants to bring before me dervishes and other needy persons.
I also directed the sons of S&#863;haik&#863;h Muhammad
G&#863;haus&#804;, the grandson of S&#863;haik&#863;h
Waj&#299;hu-d-d&#299;n, and other leading Shaikhs to produce whatever
persons they believed to be in want. Similarly I appointed some women
to do the same thing in the harem. My sole endeavour was that as I a
king had come to this country after many years, no single person should
be excluded. God is my witness that I did not fall short in this task,
and that I never took any rest from this duty. Although I have not been
delighted with my visit to Ahmadabad, yet I have this
satisfaction&mdash;that my coming has been the cause of benefit to a
large number of poor people.</p>
<p class="par">On Tuesday, the 16th, they caught Kaukab, the son of
Qamar K&#863;h&#257;n. He had in Burhanpur put on a faqir&rsquo;s dress
and gone off into the wilds. The brief account of his case is
this:&mdash;He was the grandson of M&#299;r
&#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f, who was one of the Saif&#299; Sayyids
and was attached to this Court. Kaukab had been appointed to the Deccan
army, and had spent some days with it in poverty and wretchedness. When
for a long time he did not get promotion he suspected that I was
unfavourable to him, and foolishly took the dress of asceticism and
went off to the wilderness. In the course of six months he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb441" href="#pb441" name=
"pb441">441</a>]</span>traversed the whole of the Deccan, including
Daulatabad, Bidar, Bijapur, the Carnatic, and Golconda, and came to the
port of D&#257;bul.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9359src" href=
"#xd24e9359" name="xd24e9359src">128</a> From there he came by ship to
the port of Gog&#257;, and after visiting the ports of Surat,
Bro&#257;ch, etc., he reached Ahmadabad. At this time Z&#257;hid, a
servant of S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n, arrested him and brought him to
Court. I ordered them to bring him before me heavily bound. When I saw
him I said to him, &ldquo;Considering the obligations of service of
your father and grandfather, and your position as a houseborn one, why
have you behaved in such an inauspicious manner?&rdquo; He replied that
he could not tell a lie in the presence of his <i>qibla</i> and real
teacher, and that the truth was that he had hoped for favours, but as
he was unlucky he had left outward ties and gone into the wilderness of
exile. As his words bore the marks of truth they made an impression on
me, and I abandoned my harsh tone and asked him if in his misfortunes
he had waited upon &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, or
Qut&#804;bu-l-Mulk, or &#703;Ambar. He replied that though he had been
unsuccessful at this Court and had remained thirsty in this boundless
ocean of beneficence, he had never&mdash;God forbid that he
should&mdash;approached with his lips other fountains. Might his head
be cut off if it had bowed at this Court and then lowered itself at
another! From the time that he went into exile he had kept a diary
showing what he had done, and by examining it it would be seen how he
had conducted himself. These words of his increased my compassion for
him, and I sent for his papers and read them. It appeared from them
that he had encountered great hardship, and that he had spent much time
on foot, and that he had suffered from want of food. On this account I
felt kindly disposed towards him. Next day I sent for him and ordered
them to remove the bonds from his arms and legs, and gave him a robe of
honour, a horse, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442"
name="pb442">442</a>]</span>and 1,000 rupees for his expenses. I also
increased his rank by one half, and showed him such kindness as he
never had imagined. He repeated this verse&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;What I see, is it, O God, waking or in a
trance?</p>
<p class="line">Do I behold myself in such comfort after such
torture?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par first">On Wednesday, the 17th, I marched 6 kos and halted
at the village of B&#257;ras&#299;nor (B&#257;las&#299;nor). It has
already been mentioned that the plague had appeared in Kashmir. On this
day a report of the chronicler of events arrived, stating that the
plague had taken firm hold of the country and that many had died. The
symptoms were that the first day there was headache and fever and much
bleeding at the nose. On the second day the patient died. In the house
where one person died all the inmates were carried off. Whoever went
near the sick person or a dead body was affected in the same way. In
one instance the dead body was thrown on the grass, and it chanced that
a cow came and ate some of the grass. It died, and some dogs that had
eaten its flesh also all died. Things had come to such a pass that from
fear of death fathers would not approach their children, and children
would not go near their fathers. A strange thing was that in the ward
in which the disease began, a fire broke out and nearly 3,000 houses
were burnt. During the height of the plague, one morning when the
people of the city and environs got up, they saw circles on their
doors. There were three large circles, and on the face of these (i.e.
inside them) there were two circles of middle size and one small one.
There were also other circles which did not contain any
whiteness<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9374src" href="#xd24e9374" name=
"xd24e9374src">129</a> (i.e. there were no inner circles). These
figures were found on all the houses and even on the mosques. From the
day when the fire took place and these circles appeared, they say there
was a diminution of the plague. This has been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name=
"pb443">443</a>]</span>recorded as it seems a strange affair. It
certainly does not agree with the canons of reason, and my intellect
cannot accept it. Wisdom is with God! I trust that the Almighty will
have mercy on his sinful slaves, and that they will be altogether freed
from such calamity.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 18th, I marched 2&frac12; kos and
halted on the bank of the Mah&#299;. On this day the J&#257;m
zamindar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9383src" href="#xd24e9383" name=
"xd24e9383src">130</a> had the good fortune to kiss the ground. He
presented 50 horses, 100 muhrs, and 100 rupees. His name is Jass&#257;,
and J&#257;m is his title. Whoever succeeds is called J&#257;m. He is
one of the chief zamindars of Gujarat, and, indeed, he is one of the
noted rajas of India. His country is close to the sea. He always
maintains 5,000 or 6,000 horse, and in time of war can supply as many
as 10,000 or 12,000. There are many horses in his country; Kachh&#299;
horses fetch as much as 2,000 rupees. I gave him a dress of honour.</p>
<p class="par">On the same day Lachm&#299; Nar&#257;yan, Raja of
K&#363;ch (Bih&#257;r), which adjoins Bengal, did homage and presented
500 muhrs. He received a dress of honour and an ornamented dagger.</p>
<p class="par">Naw&#257;zish K&#863;h&#257;n, son of Sa&#703;&#299;d
K&#863;h&#257;n, who had been appointed to J&#363;naga&#7771;h, had the
good fortune to pay his respects. On Friday, the 19th, I halted, and on
Saturday, the 20th, I marched 3&frac34; kos and halted at the tank of
Jhan&#363;d. On Sunday I marched 4&frac12; kos and halted at the tank
of Badarw&#257;l&#257;. On this day there came the news of the death of
&#703;Az&#804;amat K&#863;h&#257;n Gujar&#257;t&#299;. On account of
illness he had remained in Ahmadabad. He was a servant who knew
one&rsquo;s disposition, and did good work. As he had thorough
knowledge of the Deccan and Gujarat, I was grieved at his death. In the
tank above mentioned I noticed a plant which at the approach of the
finger or the end of a stick contracts its leaves. After a while it
opens them out again. Its leaves resemble those of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name="pb444">444</a>]</span>the
tamarind, and it is called in Arabic
<i>S&#863;hajaru-l-h&#803;ay&#257;</i>, &lsquo;the plant of
modesty.&rsquo; In Hind&#299; it is called <i>Lajvant&#299;</i>.
<i>L&#257;j</i> means modesty. It is certainly not void of strangeness.
They also call it <i>nag&#863;hzak</i>, and say that it also grows on
dry land.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 22nd, I halted. My scouts reported that
there was a tiger in the neighbourhood which vexed wayfarers, and in
the forest where it was they had seen a skull and some bones lying.
After midday I went out to shoot it, and killed it with one discharge.
Though it was a large tiger, I had killed several that were larger.

<p class="par">Pahluw&#257;n Bah&#257;&#702;u-d-d&#299;n, the
musketeer, brought a young monkey (<i>lang&#363;r</i>) with a goat, and
represented that on the road one of his marksmen had seen the female
langur with a young one in its arms on a tree. The cruel man had shot
the mother, which on being struck had left the young one on a branch,
and had herself dropped on the ground and died. Pahluw&#257;n
Bah&#257;&#702;u-d-d&#299;n had then come up and taken down the young
one, and had put it beside the goat to be suckled. God had inspired the
goat with affection for it, and it began to lick the monkey and to
fondle it. In spite of difference of species she showed such love as if
it had come out of her own womb. I told them to separate them, but the
goat immediately began to lament, and the young langur also became much
distressed. The affection of the monkey is not so remarkable, as it
wanted to get milk, but the affection of the goat for it is remarkable.
The langur is an animal belonging to the monkey tribe. But the hair of
the monkey (<i>maim&#363;n</i>) is yellowish and its face is red, while
the hair of the langur is white and its face is black. Its tail, too,
is twice as long as the maimun&rsquo;s. I have written these things on
account of their strangeness. On Monday, the 29th, I halted and went to
hunt nilgaw. I shot two, one male and one female. On Tuesday also, the
30th, I halted.</p>

who had the title of Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n, was born at Delhi of a

Mag&#863;hrib&#299;. He acquired from him spiritual and secular
learning, and came to Gujarat in the time of Sult&#804;&#257;n
Ah&#803;mad. High and low accepted him, and paid him homage. Afterwards
he travelled to Arabia and Persia, and made the acquaintance of many

of the words <i>takl&#299;f-i-Musalm&#257;n&#299; bar kas&#299;
nakunand</i>. I think the reference clearly is to circumcision, and
that the words <i>takl&#299;f-i-Musalm&#257;n&#299;</i> should be
rendered &lsquo;the Muhammadan ceremonial.&rsquo; This explains why the
injunction comes in immediately after the prohibitions against blinding
and mutilation. It has been said, and I believe with truth, that the
members of the Delhi royal family never were circumcised. Probably one
reason for this was that in many instances they had Hindu mothers. As

According to Vullers&rsquo; Dict., i, 482, a <i>t&#363;lcha</i> is 96
grains or about half a tola. The
G&#863;h&#299;yas&#804;u-l-log&#863;h&#257;t, however, says that
<i>t&#363;lcha</i> is merely the Persian form of the
Hindust&#257;n&#299; <i>t&#363;l&#257;</i>. According to the
Burhan-i-q&#257;ti&#702; a tola is only 2&frac12; m&#257;sha in Upper
India. Generally it is reckoned as 12 m&#257;sha. According to Sir

have considerably increased during the twelve months. Perhaps we should
